Bloomfield, Matuse;The origin story of renegade warrior Furiosa before her encounter and teamup with Mad Max.;"[""From start to finish, Furiosa is filled with heart-pounding action sequences, breathtaking visuals, and a captivating storyline. Anya Taylor's performance as Furiosa is nothing short of incredible, showcasing her strength, determination, and vulnerability. The film's post-apocalyptic setting is brought to life with stunning cinematography and jaw-dropping practical effects.The intense chase scenes and thrilling battles will keep you on the edge of your seat. Furiosa is a modern action classic that deserves all the praise it has received. Don't miss out on this epic adventure!You should see this one the biggest screen possible!"", 'I feel many go into Furiosa expecting a Mad max movie, and at its core it is so much different. With its predecessor being Fury road, Furiosa had a very high bar to achieve. However, these 2 movies are so different, while they may seem similar they are completely different action movies. Furiosa takes on a much more gritty aesthetic with the use of slightly more muted colors, a much different protagonist, and a more complex story. The use of cgi is pretty disappointing, if you have a keen eye you can pretty easily the digital doubles and green screen. Furiosa, while it may have many flaws, is one of the best action movies to come out in recent times, and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves.', 'When I say breaking bad, LOTR is a 10, and I give this a 8, thats an amazing score and compliment.I thought there was no way this movie was gonna beat fury road, but wow i was surprised. I cannot tell you what it lacked, because I truly feel like this movie was so well rounded, and diligently executed. It had action, script, well playing actors, drama, cinematography and music!!This is what you come to the cinema for, how lucky are we to have watched to extremely good movie this year already ( dune 2 ). I could be talked in to watching this a second time for sure.Oh god I love good movies!', 'A weak repeat of its original version that is extremely boring, devoid of content, and even lacks the appeal of real action. I prefer to watch the 2015 version and enjoy it instead of watching this film. The performances are extremely weak and unconvincing, making it impossible for you to sympathize with them. The lack of contrast and ups and downs in the film prevents you from getting engaged and understanding it. Even the director fails to create the suspense he aims to instill in you. In terms of special effects and sound quality, if I were to compare it with the film ""Dune II"" that I watched on the same IMAX screen two months ago, I must say it was really unsuccessful in this area. The sounds not only failed to shock you but also created noise.', ""A badass female revenge story with a character who can only trust herself in the game of survival. This film has car chases and biker hordes and flaming death, but almost more impressive are the small moments of beauty that you won't find anywhere else.Synopsis:\nSnatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers, young Furiosa falls into the hands of a great biker horde led by the warlord Dementus. Sweeping through the Wasteland, they come across the Citadel, presided over by the Immortan Joe. As the two tyrants fight for dominance, Furiosa soon finds herself in a nonstop battle to make her way home."", ""If you're expecting a non-stop, fast paced, high octane movie like Fury Road you'll be sadly disappointed with this outing. The first half is slow. Not to say there aren't interesting points but it could have been tightened up instead of dragged out.The last hour is action packed. Not great but also not terrible.There's a lot of call backs to Fury Road, almost as if they were going for a nostalgic vibe but that movie is not even 10 years ago yet.If you didn't know beforehand that Chris Hemsworth was in the movie you wouldn't know it was even him. He's rocking prosthetic nose and teeth and speaks in a high pitched nasal voice.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"[""I'm bummed I didn't love this. The visuals are as good as ever, both from cinematography to cgi it just looks fantastic. Unfortunately it falls flat mostly everywhere else. A classic hero's journey through the remnants of this universe's apocalyptic landscape is a great idea, but the journey itself is just devoid of sauce. It's bland, and often just feels like we're watching scenes checking off boxes from an adventure story. Like a movie coming out of an assembly line. Character motivations are unclear, the mc's emotional arc is unclear, and overall every idea just doesn't feel fleshed out, even when they almost have a good one. How Caesar's legacy is handled in this movie is almost interesting, but again it is not fleshed out. I will say the movie starts strong, I didn't really start turning on it til I realized how bored I was about halfway through. And that's before the third act really just frustrated me. Almost feels like we're seeing the first draft of a potentially great movie. Still excited to see where the franchise goes, but this new set of movies is off to a rough start for me."", ""I'm a big fan of all the planet of the apes, and they nailed this one. Usually when they start milking series like this, they come out bad, but with the amazing cinematography and great acting, it more than succeeded. Some movies just deserve to be watched on a big screen, and this is one of them. The movie had me intrigued, and interested in the storyline unlike a lot of other movies I've seen this year. I'm looking forward to what they will come up with after this, and I can assure you that I will be watching no matter what. Go grab a popcorn and enjoy the phenomenal graphics this movies has to offer! Godspeed."", 'Are there any directors left that have watched a Spielberg movie so they can see how to pace an action adventure movie? Very few movies are actually so well written, acted and directed as to warrant a 2:30+ hr run time. This was not one of them. But with some proper editing, you could make a tight 2:10 movie that keeps things moving along.The story wasnt bad. The characters werent bad. The acting was good enough. They just took a very long time to get to anything. Then the action picks up for a bit, things get good, it gets exciting and you get another long dull 15-20 min segment. A good editor would bring those segments down to 5-10 min and keep the movie rolling along.', ""Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes isn't a bad film, nowhere near as impressive as the other films in the franchise. Whereas Rise and Dawn had really interesting explorations of the human condition, and presenting human nature as being both inherently selfish and inherently altruistic in an engaging manner, Kingdom fails to present human characters of much substance. The female lead lacks depth, she's just inherently selfish throughout the entire film, even as going so far as to use Noa to get the satellite link.The opening to the film, after the egg scene which was very strong, was a little weak. Caeser strives incrediblely hard to find his oasis, and yet it gets destroyed within the first 15 minutes of the film, in about 5 minutes? It effectively retconned the last film, Caeser's sacrifice was for nothing.The ending is quite good. By introducing the concept of the human survivors, it makes for an interesting way to introduce a new trilogy. Kingdom isn't necessarily a bad film, but nowhere near as impressive as the complexity of Rise and Dawn, or even the original Planet of the Apes and Beneath the planet of the apes."", 'The setup of several generations later and how Caesar became a legend, practically like a ""messiah,"" was interesting, but having a character who didn\'t measure up to Caesar and then the twist with Mae becoming the real protagonist was disappointing. Although Freya\'s performance was very nice, the story was centered around Noa and her journey of transformation and liberation from her clan, yet everything leaned towards Mae\'s purpose. I was expecting more action, more strategy like in the first installment, and above all, for Noa to become a new and evolved Caesar. The characters lack strength, and the ending was obvious and resolved in a simplistic manner. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" remains my favorite.', ""Was so looking forward to this film even book my ticket in advance as I really enjoy this reboot series. However this one is really disappointing! While the cinematography and AI is absolutely phenomenal, the lead characters have far too human traits! And the human lead character, very disappointing & unbelievable, the casting of Freya Allan is really hammy, they obviously needed a Gen Z in the film. Too many holes in the plot, they filled up the film with stuff & missed opportunities to explore some scenarios in more depth. There was a great opportunity to give a nod to the original, when they were walking along the beach which they missed, (guess what I'm thinking)?. Perhaps it would have been better with a more focused storyline."", 'With its captivating universe and engaging storyline, ""Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes"" is a success. The stunning visuals, top-notch special effects, and remarkable graphics greatly contribute to creating a fully immersive experience in this world. The compelling evolution of Noa, the main character, who gains confidence and charisma throughout the film, adds an enthralling dimension to the narrative, leaving us eagerly anticipating the next installment. The themes explored in the film add an extra layer of depth to the story, enriching the overall cinematic experience. However, at a runtime of 2 hours and 20 minutes, a few scenes may feel a bit lengthy, but this does not diminish the enjoyment of the spectacle.', 'Weakest of all the post 2010 POTA movies imo. Too much ape politics, family life and philosophising and too little else. The original and Beneath the POTA are still by far the best two POTA movies for me, and all done without CGI. You can only be wowed for so long by how well the apes are rendered and for me that ran out of steam 2 movies ago. This movie seems to serve little purpose other than to set up the next one. Couple of nice flash backs to the original (the human hunt horns and the music when they encounter the scarecrows on the bridge) but other than that, an overly long, pretty forgettable movie with a lame story and script.', 'Missed Caesar, or someone related to him and his legacy. And strange how the apes spoke much more like humans. Liked their ""silent"", hand-gesture communication in the first three movies, and how the music and sound supported the story and the feelings you experienced as the story evolved.Somehow, the apes became a bit too much like humans.However, Noa had the same kindness to him as Caesar, and in the end it became better, more feelings, more mystery. But we\'re still going to watch the next ones, of course. And our next dog will be named Caesar, my girls said. They love Caesar! ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was light-hearted fun, the action was good, the chemistry between Gosling and Blunt was believable and the humour was tongue in cheek.The plot is suitably nonsense (as fitting given its 1980s TV origins). Don't think too hard about it. If you ponder questions such as: what about the other witnesses? Can you recover from a broken back to that extent in 18 months? Would he have reported a crime that he was being framed for? When he goes through real windscreens, falls long distances onto hard surfaces, etc., how does he not break any bones? And so on.... well, it will spoil your fun.Kudos to Aaron Taylor-Johnson for playing an absolute arsehole so well. Gosling carries off the comedy better than I would have given him credit for, given his previous work that I have seen. Emily Blunt is always watchable.So grab your popcorn and enjoy the ride."", ""Just back from the cinema and can't remove the smile from my face. This genre of movie has been really lacking lately. Silly, cheesy, action packed movies that are just fun.I'm a fan of the original television show and while this is it's own thing it definitely gives a nod here and there to the 80's. The casting is great, the stunts are brilliant, the plot is fairly thin but hey, it's a popcorn movie. Not everything has to be Oscar worthy.I'd really love to see more movies like this released. Very little CGI, good stunts and just fun. The homage to the stuntmen at the end of the movie was a really nice touch too. Job well done."", ""While watching this movie, I found myself smiling nearly the entire time. If you are looking for pure, unfettered fun (in the form of romcom action of course), then this is the movie for you. The plot was fun, the acting was solid, the situations that the characters found themselves in were hysterical, the action was on point, the cinematography was nice, and the romance was entertaining. Upon leaving the theater, I couldn't think of any complaints. Again, I was just smiling. Sure, there may be some ambiguities about the context and background of the antagonist's intentions, but I was too involved in the fun to care. 10/10 film."", 'Well, what can I say?! It\'s entertaining, but surely not as much as I expected. Ryan and Emily are excellent, what really can\'t be said about any among the rest of the cast. There is a bit of action, but surely not as much as one expects according to the title and the fact of the movie being based on the old series of the same name. There is also some comical romance, but nothing really too convincing. The last 15 minutes plus the credits showing the ""making of"" scenes to one side of the screen, are the most enjoyable, especially as there are some (somewhat expected) cameos for movie lovers. 6/10 points.', ""The whole movie is like a lot is going on yet it's all very flat. Some scenes are just too cheesy. The pacing was somewhat weird but i guess it is very likely to happen when you try to blend chunks of romcom, action, and crime scenes altogether into a 2-hour movie.Was kinda surprised by Aaron Taylor-Johnson though. Have always thought of him as a great actor but never realized he can be good at playing a silly cartoonish and very stereotypical character also. He was hilarious! !Overall it's not to my personal taste at all but this is an okay movie. If you're looking for a no-brainer fun movie you can go for it but don't expect too much."", 'Just got out of the Austin premier at SXSW and the whole theatre went nuts for the movie! Emily and Ryan have crazy chemistry and obviously a freaking amazing time shooting this. What a ton of fun!! Its packed with incredible stunts - none of them CGI, its funny and charming and exciting in every second. The camera work is flawless, the cinematography beautiful, the casting perfect, the costumes cool af, they have a DOG!! As a fan of the original series, I loved the movie for its celebration of stund craft and its people. Its a beautiful reminiscence to the original. Defo watching it again when it officially launches. God, I love Ryan and Emily. And thank you so much, David Leitch for making this happen. Seriously. Whatever you touch is incredibly fun to watch. Cant wait for the next one!!!!', 'Contrary to many of my previous movie reviews, ""The Fall Guy"" left me deeply disappointed, and I\'m not inclined to jump on the bandwagon of praise. It\'s not to say that praise isn\'t warranted, but the film surprised me with its numerous shortcomings. While the stunts are undeniably impressive, perhaps the best in movie history, the glaring lack of well-scripted dialogue and a compelling plot significantly detract from its overall quality.Moreover, it seemed that the movie prioritized showcasing Ryan Gosling\'s appearance over demonstrating any depth or range in character development. Yes, the chemistry between Gosling and Emily Blunt is believable, but ultimately, the film felt more like a drawn-out chick flick than a substantial cinematic experience.While the ending may offer some satisfaction, it\'s not enough to redeem the film entirely. If your sole reason for watching ""The Fall Guy"" is to admire Gosling\'s good looks, I find it hard to believe, but even then, the movie leaves much to be desired.', ""The trend of 3 hour epics, with overly serious narrative, performances, and character development that require 100% attention has dominated cinema for the last decade across every genre.The fun popcorn flick, that dominated the 80s and 90s that made you laugh, with great on screen chemistry between the leads, with a visual spectacle and banging soundtrack is a lost art.Here's a throwback to that era - Blunt and Gosling are great on screen together, simple narrative with some fun (yet predictable) twists and turns and visually great with all bells and whistles of modern filmmaking. Never taking itself seriously with a wink to the audience - grab your popcorn, and your choc top and enjoy 2hrs of fun."", ""8.5/10\nIt's a funfest of a film The Fall Guy is, one whole theater just out laughing joy at the film as it is the funniest film i've seen in a long time, and i haven't open up my laughter personally for a new comedy in a long time too, Ryan Gosling has just killing it lately since Barbie, his performance in The Fall Guy was definitely the most entertaining performance of the year so far, his chemistry with Emily Blunt was enjoyable and good, David Leitch excellent direction especially the action sequences was great, the cinematography was great, the soundtrack was good, the special effects was great, the story was entertaining enough while it's not completely original but still fun, i just wish it wasn't this long of a movie, i do felt it's a bit too long, but overall i still enjoy the hell out of The Fall Guy for the most part, it's fun, and it's enjoyable, it's one of the most entertaining films of the year."", '""The Fall Guy"" is insanely fun, with incredibly cool action scenes, romantically charming elements, and a captivating world of stuntmen. It\'s full-on entertainment, especially for film enthusiasts, with meticulously crafted action sequences in both real and fake movies that look fantastic, grand, and impressively complete. Both Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt have impeccable chemistry, and the portrayal of the stuntman profession is sharp. The film cleverly satirizes the Hollywood industry with excellence.Watching this movie in theaters is an absolutely delightful experience. Director David Leitch nails every aspect of the film, truly delivering on the action-packed excitement.', ""The scenes of the movie are beautiful, but the scenario is very classic. We are bored now. I saw something, I witnessed something, they came after me. We watched such movies many times. My score is 6.5.... Hollywood needs to come to its senses and find good scripts. Science visual effects, remaking old movies is a sign of burnout. I saw the killer, everyone came after me. What is this Friends? Meanwhile, there is a woman I love and I'm trying to get back together with her. It was just a movie showing these stunts. Please find better scenarios. Meanwhile, the woman doesn't seem to love enough. Very dull. Very cold."", 'This film is really bad. Blunt and Gosling I think were cast to be looked at, and the story is non existent trollop at best. The chemistry between characters that have no development whatsoever is non existent, because it has no ingredients. I really fail to understand how this could be called entertaining. I and my wife watched this rubbish for about 45 minutes and could stand no more. There are worse films maybe but this one would be hard to beat. Maybe somewhere in amongst the full movie there is a moment or two that is funny or fun, but I never saw anything at all that could be described that way in the first 45 boring monotonous minutes .Save yourself the tedious , nonsense and watch anything else!']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A great story with a great director/producer. After that the best thing a studio can do is get the hell out of the way and let artists create art.Dune Part 2 is creative, beautiful, tragic, and mesmerizing. Never once did I get bored or anticipate what was going to happen next. I haven't read the book so I have nothing to compare it to.Denis Villeneuve continues to amaze me with the effort he puts into each of his films. The acting in this film was top notch too. We saw it in IMAX and the sound was earth shattering. If you're gonna see this movie, see it on the largest screen possible."", 'I\'m going to write this as a review for both Dune movies, so I\'ll include my thoughts about Dune part one throughout. For me, the most difficult part about rating these movies is trying to judge them as they stand on their own without comparing them to the original book.As movies, I think both are great: the cinematography is amazing, the sound design is good, the acting is good, I liked the visual style and how they interpreted the various technologies of the world of Dune. The soundtrack is good, it can be a little overbearing at times but the music in part two felt like an improvement on this from part one. One of the biggest complaints people had with both movies is the pacing, saying that the first movie was dragging and the second was rushing. I agree with the sentiments about the latter, but personally I enjoyed the slower pacing of the first Dune movie. The second movie definitely moves quickly through its first half, then it slows down a lot in the second half before rushing to its conclusion.The casting is good for the most part, I personally disagree with casting Rebecca Ferguson but I\'ll get into that more later. In the first movie I wasn\'t especially impressed with Timothée Chalamet as Paul but I think he does better in the role in the second part. Jason Momoa was a perfect pick for Duncan Idaho and Oscar Isaac did a great job as Duke Leto. Stellan Skarsgard was a good choice for Baron Harkonnen but I think he could have been written better. I was really looking forward to seeing Christopher Walken as the Emperor Shaddam but unfortunately he felt pretty lifeless and didn\'t bring very much energy to the scenes he was in.Overall, as they stand on their own, the Dune movies are great films. I don\'t know if I\'d call them the defining sci-fi movies of the 21st century like other people are saying, but they\'re still very good, definitely rewatchable, and I would recommend them.Now, moving on to comparing them to the books, because once you start doing that you get to the more disappointing side of these movies. One of the biggest issues with both movies, especially the second, is that they almost completely leave out the ecological message of the book. This is a book that has been used as a textbook in environmental science classes, but I guess the filmmakers decided that message wasn\'t important enough. The Fremen are shown to be working towards terraforming Dune into a green world, slowly but surely making wind traps and planting grasses to fix the dunes in place. It\'s a goal that they are working towards with total commitment even though they know that it won\'t be realized for several generations. That\'s a powerful message that I think a lot more people need to hear nowadays, especially in reference to the issue of climate change. The movie barely mentions this goal at all, which I think is a disservice to the original story, and it diminishes the Fremen as characters.I think the fundamental issue that these movies have with their adaptations is an understandable one, but that it could\'ve been solved in a better way. The main issue with adapting the book is that the characters are very difficult to relate to: most of them are superhumans who have insane abilities. For the movies, a lot of the main characters are altered to make them more relatable to the audience, which is an understandable change. For some characters, this greatly improves them from the book, such as Duncan Idaho and Duke Leto. For others, like Chani and Jessica, it reduces the strength of their characters, which I\'ll explain more later.Additionally, the book has a lot of complex concepts and story plots that it never stops to fully explain to the reader, you\'re just supposed to pick it up as you go along and reread it to understand, making it a little obtuse. Dune is very dialogue-heavy, with a lot of the action happening in the background or only described briefly. To remedy this, the movies remove some of the more complex topics and add more action scenes, which are exciting and well choreographed, but in the second movie they start feeling repetitive and redundant, and they overpower the more intricate plot points.While the first movie cleverly managed to insert a lot of exposition without feeling like it was constantly lore dumping, part two feels like it\'s more afraid to explain things than the first, possibly because of complaints that ""nothing happened"" in the first movie. The result of this is that the second movie is much more action-heavy, but it still wants to include the complex topics from the book, so what we get is a bunch of action sequences with scenes of political complexities strung in between them, but without the full explanations necessary to clarify them. It\'s easy to understand why people who haven\'t read the books would feel confused by this, the movie barely takes the time to explain what\'s happening before it\'s moving on to the next scene of Fremen blowing up spice haulers.Getting into direct comparisons to the book now, and starting with the first movie: my two biggest issues with the first movie was how they changed Jessica and how they dumbed down the mentats. Starting with mentats, they are a hugely important part of all of the Dune books";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But unfortunately this is how a bad lead actress (singer!) can ruin a movie. I just had to decrease the volume to 5% most of the time because Jeniffer would cry and scream every 2 minutes which makes the movie really tedious and hard to follow. From the strory point of view, also the story is again too much Jeniffer centered. I wished to see more of Android universe, and how they live or how their world works. Some character building on their side! Overall I think if Netflix want to conquer the sci-fi market it should go for better actors and directors who know this genre better.', 'Was it great no!!! Will it hold a spot in the Sci-fi Hall of Fame No!! But Did it hold me and Family attention for 2hr sure did..

The back and forth between her and Smith was entertaining. Everyone is entitled to there opinions but to say this movie is Trash just because Jlo is in it, is crazy .

It is yet another take on the 'ai will take over the world'. But since I am a big fan of the Titanfall series it was great to experience a movie that was set unintentionally in the world of Titanfall. Jennifer Lopez would not have been my first choice to star in this type of movie, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by her acting. The relationship between ai and humans got very well portrayed by Jennifer. I even almost shed a tear in the end of the movie. Having said this, I would say that there is a lot of untapped potential. It was a good experience, but it could have been amazing with a more compelling story and build up. The story felt a bit cliché at moments but the CGI partly made up for this."", ""This film has a bit of everything that you would find in the average nerds bedroom.... Aliens, Terminator, Titanfall, and every geeks current favourite.....AIThrow in a bit of eye candy in the form of JLo (for some reason) then try to hold it all together with the idea that people and robots can live together (also Titanfall 2s campaign story).This just feels like the creatives behind it were handed a ton of money and told to go wild. It looks great, even has some cool scenes, but is basically predictable cheese that netflix tends to be known for.As long as you go into this with low expectations, it's still pretty watchable for a sci-fi film."", 'A good idea was laid to waste by such poor acting. It was painful to watch Jenifer Lopez... ""pain"" (grimace) for the duration of the whole movie... walking as if she had a stick on her legs and back (apparently it is how a ""tough"" girl walks?) was there no other emotion for the whole movie?The whole environment felt like a game rather than a real life/alien environment.It felt hollow, empty, rushed, but lots effort to do... what?Why would you destroy a good story with kid gimmicks, frag fest and a horrible actress? Keep her to the rom com where she was ok?I am even struggling to put this together...', ""The first review headline of ATLAS I saw in the press was a negative one, but as an absolute and unashamed sci-fi enthusiast I watched the movie anyway, as I had planned to do ever since I learned of its existence. It is a solid sci-fi/action movie. The tech levels are (as usual) all over the place, and most of the background detail are not intelligently written, but what really matters is that the friendship arc between Atlas and Smith really works. The acting is effective at what it needs to do, and the story becomes touching and relevant. It's no masterpiece but it is a good movie, very pulp fiction in style (a single heroine saves the entire world!), and absolutely worthy of 7 stars out of 10 - no less and no more.However, I was extremely tempted to rate it higher in order to off-set the low ratings of all the haters.

Read all;"['""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is not the sort of film I enjoy and I after watching it, I am not a huge fan though I deeply respect the filmmakers. The reason I even saw it was the insane reaction the public had to this one...and the critical reviews were all surprisingly good. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about...and try to understand why folks liked it so much. My take on it is that if you enjoy a film that is non-stop amazing action, then this one is for you. As far as the story goes, it\'s plot is super-thin--but the movie is handled so well and the stunts so amazingly insane that you don\'t mind. Worth seeing--but I sure wouldn\'t like to see a lot of films like this. Additionally, it was VERY refreshing to see a film where so many women are NOT mindless objects to be killed or protected--several are about as strong and heroic as Max himself--and no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much.', ""The rationale behind the success of 'Fury Road' predominantly lies with director George Miller whose commitment and love for the film series that he's been developing since its first outing in 1979 is evident throughout, and it's pretty obvious that he knows how to craft a damn fine action sequence. Without this passion, the film would have likely stooped as there's not much else in the way of a plot or character development, even though Theron tries her hardest to give us an enthralling new action heroine to be revered. Aside from the aforementioned writing setbacks, 'Fury Road' is a powerhouse in the technical categories. With stunning contradictory cinematography from John Seale giving us a post-apocalyptic world of lavish colour rather than your typical muted tones, a heart-pounding score from Junkie XL and exquisite production design work that rightfully earnt the film an Oscar (one of six) for its spectacular vehicle design."", 'I realize a lot of people will disagree with me ... but personally ... I don\'t like movies that leave me scratching my head with a lot of questions at the end. I prefer to ... you know ... understand the movies I\'m watching.Now we get from the film that the world as we know it has ended. They are fighting over gasoline and are running out of water. There\'s this guy Max who used to be a cop who has become a drifter trying to survive. There\'s this guy Immortan Joe who is really scary, clearly has health issues, and is bogarting all the water from the people. He\'s got a bunch of blood sucking kids dressed as skeletons who are his lackeys ... and he keeps a harem of women against their will (gross).Furiosa grew up in a ""green"" place with a bunch of other women ... was taken by Joe when she was young. She wants to get back there and the ""breeders"" beg her to take them. And the film is basically them trying to get away from Joe who is trying to get them back. As plots go ... it\'s extremely basic.But that is it ... that\'s all we know and it\'s all we find out (except that the green place is gone). There are a lot of MENTIONS of things that never actually get explained AND THIS IS MY PROBLEM.Who is Immortan Joe?\nWhy does he look like that?\nHow did he wind up controlling all the water?\nWhy are they drinking breast milk?\nWhy are the boys called ""half-lives"" and dressed like skeletons?\nWhy do they need ""blood bags""?\nWhat is with the silver teeth thing?\nWhat is all this Valhalla, shiny, chrome, what?\nWhy do they have a vehicle that spits fire with a dude playing electric guitar on it?\nHow did Furiosa lose her arm?\nWho was Furiosa to Joe?\nWHO DID KILL THE WORLD? (they keep asking and it never gets answered even a little bit)I had to look it up ... and I hate when movies don\'t explain things to the point where I have to look them up. That\'s what is called BAD STORYTELLING.I won\'t spoil it by telling you what was there but there is SO MUCH CRAZY INFORMATION that the movie just left out to make room for more fighting and chase scenes. This movie is 2 hours long and they couldn\'t fit any more story into it?Sorry guys ... that\'s some bad bad writing.', ""Don't take my word on this one. I recognize that I am in a small minority of people who didn't care for this move. It wasn't bad! I just think it wasn't for me. The crazy vehicles were obviously pretty cool but I couldn't rationalize the worldbuilding in it. Broke my suspension of disbelief and I couldn't really enjoy the rest of the movie I guess."", ""Great film, so fast-paced it makes every other film out there look slow and old-fashioned. Wonderful to see George Miller back on the Australian road, where he belongs. Charlize Theron is great, Tom Hardy is not bad, but the stunts are really where the film shines. It's hard to think of a better action road movie. It has all the intensity and perversity of the MAD MAX and THE ROAD WARRIOR, but amped up to new heights of craziness. Miller is the real star of the film -- in some ways technology seems to have finally caught up with his early hyperactive camera style, and he takes full advantage of the ability to move wherever he wants, however he wants."", 'Even at the beginning, there\'s no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it\'s a bad thing, no it\'s not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It\'s dangerous, but it\'s also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.The film shares Max Rockatansky\'s (Tom Hardy) adventures. Max is an ex highway patrolman. He\'s been haunted by the past, by family he never saved. He meets the Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is being pursued by the dictatorial Wasteland leader ""Joe"". Furiosa reaches for Max for help in keeping the \'Five Wives\'—women she brought with her—into safety, as Joe\'s deranged breed of warriors called The War Boys, that are barely humans, are raging across the desert to capture them. This pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape, suddenly sending them into a game of survival.After a rip-roaring opening chase sequence, Max is held captive in the Citadel, the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader ""Joe"" is ruling over. The grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land. This brings the entire populace crippling under his control. As for Max, he becomes merely a blood bag for Nux (Nick Hoult) one of Joe\'s War Boys, who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader, who has promised them the glory of getting into Valhalla, the promised land.Everything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur, even the feverish chase, even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence. Miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clichés and retreads, surging into the cinemas, today. It\'s a visual feast, but surprisingly, with sense. It\'s explosive in every unimaginable ways, but it\'s not devoid of a human story, which in this case, is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movie\'s payroll. Tom Hardy is utterly capable as the main hero, but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on Theron\'s character. At some point, there would be a sense that Max isn\'t the only one playing under the spotlight, as it gets evident Furiosa is equally as massive as his role is. Hardy here is singularly stunning, playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required. His mission transcends past his emotional torments and he\'s never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past. Same can be said with Furiosa, who is not only running from Joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip, but also to bring every woman into safety, back to freedom where they belong.Much of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of Joe\'s subjugated land, while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way. It\'s like it doesn\'t know how to stop, and if it does, that\'s surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece. There\'s an enigmatic style Miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world, and it keeps the momentum in tack, if not ever progressing. The tone of the movie, all those vividly dark colors, that magically shifts from something to another, imparts a drowning experience, only it\'s enjoying and looks festive to the eyes. This makes every eye-squashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza, turning all those burning combustions, metal blasts, and endless pursuits, from mere technical marvels into a hair-raising escapade.Amid these sanity-grabbing action sequences, though, is an emotional streak that keeps Max and Furiousa\'s humanity alive. This prompts them to survival, into carrying out their similar humane causes, clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society. This turns the movie into something visceral, cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand. It will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives. This needs to be experienced, felt, and forever cherished. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, ignites eternal fire, and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history.', ""Yo punishable by death just letting you know that this movie was shot using 80% practical effects and that's a fact on this web page so you're completely wrong when you say that it's full of cgi. But anyway this movie is a real crazy ride. From the very beginning it takes you straight into the action and never lets go. This movie is so incredibly filmed and the stunts are performed marvelously. Although this movie is said to star Tom hardy and Charlize Theron, the real star here is George miller. This man created a masterpiece and it was so beautifully put together. He managed to show the chaos and urgency without the constant shaky camera crap that we see out of action movies now. This is the best pure action movie that I've ever seen."", 'George Miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic. The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. The movie also features some surprisingly good performances. Charlize Theron being the real the star of the film, with the titular character really only acting as her support.', 'Complicated hero who is easy to latch onto. Fantastic plot that is plausible in this environment. Terrifying nemesis, horrifying and relentless. Non-stop action and brilliant stunt sequences that will make you cringe. This movie will have you feeling parched and gritty. Usually Not a fan of 3d - however, it works perfectly here. This movie has managed to honor the previous films without being clunky about it. if you love mutant vehicles, art cars, burning man, etc. you will be satisfied. A few scenes that were taking place in cobbled together 1000 hp vehicles at 50mph where it was quieter inside than a modern Cadillac - the absence of the din of machinery for the sake of dialogue was the only thing that bothered me.', 'Mad Max: Fury Road Review Just had the chance to watch this movie. Mad Max isn\'t so much a remake but rather a continuation of the story. It starts of with Max already in the post apocalyptic world. Where as Mad Max 1 was a prelude with still having some law enforcement in the world. and the rest of the series is set after all of the chaos breaks out. Fury Road is set in the same universe.The Story is fairly simple, but still enjoyable and loyal to the Mad Max Universe. Furiosa helps young women escape Immorten Joe and is headed for her childhood home. Through Actions of one of the War boys to tag along Max with him, They end up on the War Machine of Furiosa and end up trying to help become free.The Acting for most part wasn\'t bad. I do feel that Tom Hardy wasn\'t the best choice as I never really felt that he was mad like (Mel) he actually reminded me and my friends of his portrayal of Bane. His accent and voice were very close to the one he did in Bane, he also had very limited number of lines and that just made it more like Bane, not to mention that he carried himself as big guy with muscles, even though the whole time his body was covered, you felt his size in the film.Pacing is what i loved the most from the film. It had the perfect amount of actions separated with suspense moments to draw you back in before unloading more fast paced action. Right from the start we start of with some chases which don\'t just stop but actually slow down for you to be able to enjoy them a lot, and then the director uses the sense of character waiting and reaction shots to tell the story of action as to not over bore you with it. But most importantly the actions scenes are never the same and vary a lot. So that you don\'t have that feel, ""Oh its the same fight as before in the movie"" This is a very solid movie. I give two thumbs up to the director for actually making the film very well paced. Much better then Avengers Age of Ultron and all of the Transformer films, They both can take a lot away from his style. 8.5/10']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The trailer is a great representation of the film - the cheekiness, costumes, violence, and Henry Cavill\'s twirly mustache. If you liked the trailer, you\'ll probably enjoy the film.I do think the movie could\'ve been a lot more but was bogged down by the ""true story"" aspect. There are a few scenes that felt very Tarantino-esque in its hyper violence or intensity, but likely couldn\'t be taken further because of the limitations of a true story. While not mad at the casting, they could\'ve skipped on giving Alan Ritchson the crappy danish accent. And when Eiza Gonzalez\'s character\'s ethnicity is introduced, you\'ll probably raise an eyebrow considering she\'s a Mexican actress.', ""This was a very fun movie with satisfying action scenes. The action scenes can be over the top at times but it does not feel like a movie you need to take super seriously. I enjoyed every scene with the core five actors.The movie does drag a bit in the middle of the movie. This is based on a true story so I get why it's important to see all the parts of the operation. However, there is a lot of dialogue and slow pacing in the middle. It focuses a lot on what I would consider the B plot.By the end of the movie it ramps back up and you get a satisfying climax with all the parts coming together. Overall very fun laid back movie, especially if you are interested in history and WW2."", ""The movie is a beef cake sandwich crammed with testosterone and rippling biceps-- Henry Cavill and Alan Ritchson have wonderfully comedic and sincere chemistry as they chew their way through Nazis.Guy Ritchie's sensibilities are on full display-- sharp transitions, character introductions, banter worthy of Tarantino, and charm. Spiritually this film feels like a violent successor to The Man from UNCLE despite it being set decades prior. The plot is straight forward and allows for a talented cast to stretch their legs.I certainly hope this movie leads to larger action roles for Ritchson who has been stellar to date."", ""The Ministry of Ungentlemanly WarfareThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is a true story set in World War II. The story was largely unknown to the public until 2016 when documents from that era were declassified.The dramatized narrative does have its silly moments, as shown in the previews, but the story is nothing but. Had these brave men and women not completed the mission, there is a chance Hitler would have won the war.If you wish to see arrogant Nazis get shot, blown up, tortured, stabbed, or otherwise maimed, then definitely go see this movie. It was most satisfying to see as many of them hurt as possible. Even knowing that the Germans lost the war, I was on the edge of my seat during the covert action, but also laughing out loud while they perform said action.There are so many movies made about World War II that I was very pleasantly surprised to see one that I knew nothing about. I know this was intentional as the operation was classified. So many acts of bravery and heroism still continue to not see the light of day, and I cheered (along with the rest of the audience) at the conclusion.It's very much an R rated film, but this is one that everyone should see. So much could have gone wrong throughout the entire war that life today as we know it would be so different. Always remember that the war didn't just last 6 years, only direct combat. This had been going on for decades, and the lessons learned afterwards must still be repeated."", ""Saw this movie last weekend. No complaints here. Acting was great and the movie moved at a great pace. Overall I thought the movie was very fun and couldn't believe it was actually a true story. Great Britain needed to do something desperate to get the United States to commit to WW2's European Theater in the worst way and found the guys needed to get the job done. We might be living in a very different world if they failed and Churchill was put out and the appeasement faction got their way. Thankfully, we don't have to live that alternate history because these guys rocked and did what they had to. Don't go see it if watching military men kill nazis bothers you or violence because there is a lot."", ""It's basically the same premise as Tarantino's movie - get a cast of outcasts and go and mow through hordes of nazis.Where Tarantino's version had some nuance, and bad guys actually had some sort of personality, motivation, and charm, here it feels like a Call of Duty game, where NPCs are just standing there, waiting to be shot by the main character.The only redeeming qualities are - it's apparently based on a true story, the cast is good, and it's a technically competent execution.If you need a mindless action movie - you might enjoy it, but it's far from the best work of Guy Ritchie, and quite honestly - sad to see the bar has fallen so low for him."", ""I'm not sure how they managed to make a fictional retelling of a real historical military story like this one feel low stakes, but unfortunately that is how the movie feels. In addition, the chemistry and verbal sparring between the characters feels somewhat forced, almost cartoonish, I suppose. Also anachronistic.But the acting is competent, the pacing works well, the cinematography and set work and action scenes are entertaining and competent, if a little low stakes despite the carnage. Overall it's entertaining, but generally has a shallow modern interpretation that feels a little comic book like.Worth a watch, but not if you have something better to see."", 'I found it to be a moderately entertaining actioner, I don\'t know why but I just couldn\'t get that into it. The dialog just seems to be stilted, fakey, and in at least one case wholly wrong - the story starts in 1942 and the character playing Churchill complains about America\'s reluctance to join the war effort. Humm, did they forget Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 - I thought that date that will live in infamy! Maybe the main cast is too good looking to be believable, surely not all of the ""Ungentlemanly Warfare"" men were this handsome - maybe throw in an ordinary looking guy for variety. And they cast Eiza González as a Brit - really? So, I cannot give an enthusiastic thumbs up to this one, I can give a half-hearted one. So, please check it out, and make up your own mind. 6/10.', 'Apparently, I don\'t watch movies with the eyes of a critic. I watch movies to be Entertained! And man, did this movie entertain me! And it was especially entertaining in the fact that it\'s based on a true story. I was sitting in a theater that had a pretty good crowd and we all applauded at the end! The characters were fun and serious and the action was great. Our American government wanted to help the British fight Hitler. But he had the U-Boats out in the Pacific sinking anything that came along. So Churchill and some of his top peeps got a team together to ""FIX"" this problem. What\'s more, none of them could tell anyone else what they were doing because what they were doing was considered ""Ungentlemanly"" in warfare. The British... go figure! LOL! Lots of tension and action as a result! Great movie! Plus, Ian Fleming was one of the peeps and one of the ""team"" was part of the inspiration for James Bond! How cool! Go See It and Be Entertained!!!', ""It's the true WWII story of Operation Postmaster. This Guy Ritchie movie is most definitely highly fictionalized. It's 1942. Britain is in its darkest hour. The Blitz is destroying London. U-boats are cutting off the Atlantic supply route. America remains on the sidelines. The Nazis' main U-boat supply ship is located in a neutral Spanish colonial west African port. British parliament refuses to attack a neutral country. Winston Churchill secretly orders the unauthorized mission led by imprisoned soldier Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill) with his motley crew of outsiders.This is one of those real fake history movies. It's more than the normal fictionalization. It's got the wild sardonic Guy Ritchie humor. These characters are rather one dimensional with a few exceptions. It feels more like a comic book movie although that's fine since that's the intention. A highlight is the insanely gorgeous Eiza González. Alan Ritchson and his giant muscles seem to be popping up everywhere.

With everything that\'s been going on, it seems like it\'s for the best.Basically the film takes the same attitude as the shop assistant. They are combat journalists trying to speak to the President. They are not embedded as one synopsis said. If they were we might actually see the civil war. If it wasn\'t for the Presidential broadcast, as in the trailer, and the Western Forces flag (like the US flag but only 2 stars) it could have been anywhere and any war. The trailer suggests you\'re going to see the civil war. The journalists are wandering around. They take pictures of burnt out cares and sometimes combat. It\'s not explained who\'s fighting who and why. They encounter the ""what type of American are you?"" guy and the ""We\'re shooting at someone because they\'re shooting at us"" guys. Neither of these are directly part of the civil war. They\'re not on either side. In other words it\'s just a film that\'s anti-war but done in such a slow way that I was thinking of calling this review ""recommended for insomniacs"". Watching the trailer you\'d think there was constant battle throughout the film. I\'m really tempted to say that the only combat scenes in the film are the ones in the trailer but that would be unfair. The ending battle is pretty good but I do think you\'d end up with a 30 minute film if you took out all the chatting in the van. It\'s an anti-war film that doesn\'t make its point. It\'s more like a pro-sleep film.', 'There is a good movie to be made about the polarisation and aggression of US politics leading to civil war. This was not it. Uses a grossly undeveloped political scenario as an excuse to show us routine, gratuitous violence and contrived relationships. Casting an actress who looks 14 as a 23 year old was a big mistake and pushing her from wide eyed innocence through a ridiculous, unbelievable journey to awakening ambition via horror was crudely handled. Taking photos of people while they suffer and die is obscene and the pain and gore of violence was trivialised, not dignified by this sad movie.', ""Everybody should see this film. No spoilers, but it is a glimpse into what life could be like in a modern American civil war. Indeed, there is nothing civil about war. It is a terrifying film to me, primarily since it is a future that is possible. Not probable, but not a giant leap either. Collapse of government happens quickly. Just ask a former Soviet citizen.The film is captivating and intense. The couple next to me in the theater walked out 20 minutes in due to the violence. Guess what: that is what war is.

Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written?

I did find the antagonist\'s performance pretty stilted. The story basically plays like a slasher/Terminator flick where the antagonist is a ""Spider-Man"" instead of a robot. I personally found the idea interesting, and the movie did a pretty good job fleshing it out.

The city is ruled by the Van Der Koy family, headed by the matriarch Hilda Van Der Koy (Famke Janssen), with siblings Gideon (Brett Gelman) and Melanie (Downton Abbey\'s Michelle Dockery), along with Melanie\'s husband Glen (District 9\'s Sharlto Copley). Once every year, twelve people are gathered from the city by Hilda to participate in The Culling, an event where all twelve are killed on live television. In preparation, Hilda gathers Boy, Mina, and their mother and shoots Mina and their mother. Boy is spared, but he is tortured, having his tongue cut out and his ears charred by a hot poker. He is left for dead in the wilderness but is found by a mysterious Shaman (The Raid\'s Yayan Ruhian, voiced by François Chau) who nurses him back to health. He constantly trains with the Shaman in hand combat, sword skills, strength, and coordination until he is fully grown, in the hope of getting revenge against the Van Der Koys. Being mute and deaf, Boy (Bill Skarsgård) has forgotten the sound of his own voice, and imagines his inner monologue (H. Jon Benjamin) to be the voice from his favourite video game with Mina, Super Dragon Punch Force 3. Over the years, he has been constantly hallucinating Mina being by his side and speaking to him. While heading into the city to sell flowers, Boy sees Glen and Gideon arrive to round up the victims for that year\'s Culling. A woman (Frances Sholto-Douglas) in the crowd heckles Glen, he threatens to shoot her and accidentally shoots a random civilian. This causes a large fight with Boy watching, during which the Van Der Koy\'s enforcer, June 27 (Happy Death Day\'s Jessica Rothe), massacres many people, leaving only six alive who are captured by Gideon. Deciding to follow them, Boy hides in the boot of Gideon\'s car. Boy ends up at a warehouse and lip reads a conversation between Glen, Gideon, and Melanie. Then he is attacked by Glen and several of his men as Gideon leaves with Melanie. Boy brutally kills the men and befriends a captive named Basho (Bullet Train\'s Andrew Koji). Basho helps Boy interrogate Glen for information";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

And I\'m here to tell you, he has done it, he has actually done it.I was introduced to the world of dune in 1992 by playing the video game DUNE released that year. The story completely captivated me, so i decided to read the book. And to this day, it\'s one of the best stories I\'ve ever read. A tale absolutely grand in scale, and filled with details, making it really hard to adapt for the big screen, even today with all the technology we have at our disposal.I saw the film made by David Lynch, a few years after i read the book, and about 10 years after it was released, and i didn\'t enjoy it much. The 1984 film completely fails at capturing the very essence of the novel, and feels shallow and unfocused.One of the main differences with this movie and the 1984 movie, is that Villeneuve has only centered on the first half of the first novel. And with over two and a half hours runtime, he is able to concentrate more on the small details, than Lynch ever could. But on the flip side, this also means that this movie has no conclusion.From reading the book, i know what comes next, i know how this story ends. But a lot of people watching this movie, especially those who haven\'t read the book, can obviously feel like they were watching a prologue to something great, that never happens. This is a very risky move by both Villeneuve and the production companies, because this can only work if part 2 is released to conclude the story. It\'s kind of how they did it with ""the lord of the rings"" trilogy.But, still, without a conclusion, what a massive blast of a movie this is. I\'ve seen it in IMAX twice already, and the grand scale of everything, the sandworms, the space ships, the ornithopters, the buildings, the sound effects, the soundtrack, the locations. It\'s epic in every meaning of the word. And all of this without losing track of the deep relationships between the characters. This is a movie that manages to perfectly blend massive awesomeness with true heartfelt emotions.The actors are near perfectly cast, all carrying their roles really well, although i felt some of them didn\'t get enough screen time.This movie does follow the book quite closely, but some things has been changed and/or left out to fit in a movie format, i must admit that during my second IMAX viewing, i felt that Villeneuve maybe should have adapted this as a mini series instead. But that would have dramatically changed the grand scale of everything, but on the other hand, he could\'ve dived deeper into the lore. Two and a half hours to adapt half of the first novel, is cutting it real tight. And with all the stuff you are constantly being fed throughout this movie, it can become somewhat difficult to follow and understand it all.But that being said, I had really high hopes for this film, i was one of those people hyped beyond belief. I\'ve been waiting for this movie for about 30 years. And still, most of this movie is either as i imagined it myself, or better.What Denis Villeneuve has accomplished here, is actually quite astonishing, he has actually made DUNE. It\'s finally here, it\'s gigantic, and close to everything i asked for.The only big drawback, is as i mentioned, that this movie has no conclusion, it\'s two and a half hours of build-up to something great, that never happens, but it\'s still a huge epic packed with an awesome soundtrack, solid acting, fantastic CGI and sound effects and jaw dropping locations captured with brilliant cinematography. It\'s most definitively made for the big screen, absolutely no doubt about that.Denis Villeneuve has once again shown us he\'s a force to be reckoned with, a brilliant filmmaker, and one of the best of his generation, even one of the best of all time.I give this movie a 9 out of 10. We need part 2, we need it badly. This story deserves to be concluded. But if it never comes, i will just imagine the last half of the first novel with this movie as the template.', 'A work of art, the cinematography, the music the designs all beautiful. Two and a half hours that passed like nothing and makes you crave for more. The pacing may seem a bit slow at first, but it blends perfectly into the telling of the story. The characters are well writen and played and even some minor inconsistencies within these characters is overshadowed by the pure beauty of the cinematography and the impressive storytelling. Great Movie. Hoping for Part two soon.', ""High anticipation and low expectations. That was how I felt when the movie started. I read the novel three times, amazed by how the story and the characters evolves into the mindboggling epos. The movie surprises. It felt a lot like watching Space Odysse 2001. Constantly treated with artful cinematics. The story beyond the visuals was decebt as well, though slightly less impressive. Paul surprised, Leto was decent, Duncan was solid but slightly too much Hollywood. The storyline slowly opened up, just like the novel. The greatness of this film is that it deserves its time for watching it.Waiting for part 2 perfectly fits that feeling. I can highly recommend it to all that read the novel. For those who haven't, no idea how you would perceive this masterpiece."", 'Visually beautiful, narratively well constructed, good interpretations by the actors and actresses, and a new sci-fi world ready to be explored and expanded in a second movie.Excellent movie. That is all I have to say. Well done to all the cast, director, writers and team behind this treasure.', ""Haven't been floored or thoroughly transported by a film since The Lord of the Rings until now. Dune is thrilling and emotionally authentic. The best part about the movie is that it takes it's audience seriously and does not just traps them into a cinematic odyssey but also takles the storyline critically.Performances are incredible especially Oscar Issac and young Timothée Chalamet. The movie is itself captivating and the visually breathtaking cinematography is God like."", ""If you haven't read the book or seen the old movie this is gonna be super confusing and as such also boring to you. Cinematography is cool and I watched it in 4D at the movies which was a cool addition, but otherwise the movie kinda boring ngl. 6/10 cause of the cool visuals,in general 5/10 meh."", 'I just returned from a screening, and WOW! It\'s visually stunning, the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is majestic, the acting is spot on! The pacing might seem a little slow by todays standards, but it never gets boring. And I actually find it really refreshing to see serious SciFi for adults, without bangs or a ""comic relief"" every other second.I\'ve read the book about four or five times more than 20 years ago. And from my memory (I will refresh it soon) the movie stays true to the story of the book and, more importantly, its general feeling.Opposed to many other people, I also quite liked David Lynchs interpretation, despite all of its shortcomings. Because one thing that Lynch got right, was the ""psychedelic"" nature of the book.And that\'s my only gripe with Denis Villeneuves adaptation, and the reason why I don\'t give it 10 stars: While he hints at the mindaltering properties of spice, he never explores the psychedelic aspects of the book as deep as I\'d like them to be explored.Here\'s my hope for part two. If he creates a second part, and manages to keep up the quality while at the same time not shying away from the psychedelic underpinnings of the source material. He will have created a two part masterpiece.', ""Watching Dune was such a pleasure. Frank Herbert's world building, Hans Zimmer's sound, Denis Villeneuve's directing, and the cast's performance combined to tell an intimate coming-of-age story. It was a wonderful experience, layered with creativity, beautiful landscapes and fantastic music. Everything was done so meticulously that there's something in it for everybody."", ""The movie was very slow. If you haven't read the book, you will probably be lost. Also, without proper character development you don't even get surprised or annoyed when a betrayal happens. Well, if you like cool visuals, maybe the esthetics of the movie will compensate for the lack of the plot and character development. As for me, I don't care about the visual effects too much and honestly the music got a bit annoying at times.All in all this is one of the clear cases when I can say I liked the book much better.What is it with this character counts, now I am simply writing so that I have enough characters to post my review."", ""I'm a long time fan of the dune universe. Have read all the books multiple times and of course I've seen Lynch's version. This version is a lot better. Excellent world building, visually stunning and full of star power. It moves slow, which on the plus side gives it the chance to go into detail, but on the negative side means by the end it's not even at the halfway point of the first book. So it ends at the moment the mythology is just picking up. Which made me leave the cinema wishing to see part two, which unfortunately they haven't even started filming.So IMHO the reviews giving this movie a 10 or calling it the movie of the year are overly positive. It's a visually stunning start to a potentially mind blowing universe, but mainly an introduction to that universe. Maybe when the story is finished (wouldn't surprise me if they need three movies for the first book) it will be mind blowing and perfect, but for now this movie is a great introduction to the duneverse. Good, but not great. Yet."", ""Frank Herberts worldbuilding is beautifully visualised both by cast and post production. Impactful score and good pacing. A movie that sinks its hook into you within the first moments and then never let's go until It is done with you.This movie is to me a masterpiece, and I truly hope people give it a proper chance to let it try and impress them."", 'I just watched it and I am so amazed right now. I loved basically everything about it.Unlike Marvel or the new Star Wars movies there were no silly jokes, which break an epic moment. Dune is an adult and absolutely epic movie. Just incredible.', ""I've had the privilege to watch this enigmatic film at the Venice Festival. Dune is a diverse blend of sumptuous visual storytelling and magnificent cinematic experience. Director Villeneuve has built an enigmatic world that is easy to get lost in. With the help of a stellar cast and Zimmer's enthralling score, what he also brings is a gentle rawness to the film. Overall a thoughtful and hypnotic world building. It's everything a sci-fi should be."", ""I'd been meaning to read the book for years and with the film coming out I thought it was about time to get into it before watching this.Having read it, I can see why it was deemed unfilmable. So much of the plot is held within character's internal monologue and very complex political interactions. Unfortunately while the film looked great and was faithful to a few of the scenes, it failed dreadfully to bring any depth to the story. There is no background to speak of with any of the characters who appear and disappear as quickly as they came. From this point of view it has to be seen as a failure, both for people who have read the book and find it lacking. And those who haven't, who either won't get it at all, or will see some weak mystical Matrix / Star Wars type hybrid.Disappointed with this, I think I'll seek out the series."", 'The story is a 2.5hr build up to an ending that never comes. The acting and effects are great but what really made this bad was the sound editing. The god awful music and sound effects that are WAY louder than the dialogue. Very frustrating to watch/listen to.', ""I dont think I've ever forced myself to watch a movie so much before and this was only because of all the good reviews. I found it incredibly boring... I made it just over an hour and half when I realised I had no idea what was going on or knew any of the characters names.From what I remember it had good effects and was shot nicely.Admittedly, I knew nothing of Dune before watching it, so if your a fan you might love it. But I never knew nothing of Harry Potter, Hunger games, Lord of the rings, game of thrones, maze runner etc etc before watching any of them and still enjoyed all of them."", ""It's been years since I've seen anything like this. I'm not even sure that I have.I'm keeping this review short and spoiler-free, but I just wanted to say that this has become one of my favorite movies. Ever!The acting is great, the designs and effects are grounded, the music otherworldly and cinematography is completely insane. And it takes the time it needs to build the world and story, in a good and refreshing way. It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever watched!This is a movie that needs to be seen in the cinema. The vast landscapes and wonderful, thunderous soundscape is made for the big screen!"", 'Denis Villeneuve has such an amazing voice!This is a flawless piece of cinema & world build, emotional and important in themes. Kudos to everybody involved!']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
War for the Planet of the Apes;2017;Action, Adventure, Drama;7.4;PG-13;82;Matt Reeves;Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson, Steve Zahn, Karin Konoval, Amiah Miller, Terry Notary, Ty Olsson, Michael Adamthwaite, Toby Kebbell, Gabriel Chavarria, Judy Greer, Sara Canning, Devyn Dalton, Aleks Paunovic, Alessandro Juliani, Max Lloyd-Jones, Timothy Webber, Lauro David Chartrand-Del Valle;After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind.;"['War (as arguably miss-titled as it is) is once again on top of its game, with a more intense story, the effects looking better than ever, some genuine surprises and shocking moments, and the A-game acting. This trilogy has truly ended on a high note', 'A quick look at the bad reviews shows that most of them were written around the same time, mid July 2017 and most all of them are 1 star ratings, an obvious attack on the movie makers and nothing to do with the quality of the film. I urge you to ignore these fake reviews and read instead those written after the summer of 2017!', 'War for the Planet of the Apes isn\'t the masterpiece I hoped it\'d be. As someone deeply invested in the characters however, it\'s still a highly satisfying, emotionally- profound final chapter for the trilogy. War also compensates for its relative lack of allegory/social commentary with an intricately complex (and rather poetic) character/story structure, adding new merits to the franchise even if dissatisfying others. I\'ve been studying/writing about the entire Planet of the Apes franchise for the month leading up to my first viewing of War. Down the line (probably when the director\'s commentary comes out), I\'ll revisit my thoughts. For now, here are my impressions.Matt Reeves returns from Dawn with equitable ambition, making this the best-directed of the trilogy, addressing all of my primary issues from the previous film. Most notably, the pacing is better than Dawn\'s, with the emotional core always at the forefront and never sidelined. This film still doesn\'t have the unrelenting momentum of Rise, but it never dragged for me, and felt shorter than 2 hours (as opposed to the 2+ hour runtime). This was enhanced by the riveting (but admittedly sparse) action sequences, especially one not far into the film, which had me on edge. The sense of scope was far more realized in this film, venturing through different landscapes while not feeling claustrophobic, and implying a massive new world of unknown territory. Overall this was an ambitious film, but it didn\'t innovate from Dawn as Dawn innovated from Rise- -at the time shooting in the mud and rain, now opting for a tamer, snowy environment.Visually, this is nothing short of a spectacle. The (borderline R-rated) Holocaust imagery is genuinely haunting and unsettling, and crafts a unique tone with the sci-fi premise. Chinlund\'s production design is more enthralling than Dawn\'s, even if more greenscreen was used to get the result, contradicting the ambitious physical sets from before. The cinematography by Seresin also improves here, achieving some rather interesting shots, if still less engaging than the symbolic photography from Rise. As for the CG, I\'m blown away. As good as the previous films were, there were still moments in which the effects were noticeably computer-generated. In War. . . the effects are flawless--so seamless that I never once actually saw ""CGI"". The effects in here are no less than groundbreaking. Spectacle isn\'t everything though, as there were various, smaller directorial flaws woven throughout.For one, the title card didn\'t match the style of the first two films, and the highlights of the former films\' titles felt shoehorned-in. Also consider the distracting Coke truck in the middle of nowhere, and the ridiculously thin layers of snow covering the tunnels. How much effort would it have taken to show the characters digging or mining through stone? I can mostly excuse these smaller flaws on merits of the meticulously- crafted story.This is the sole film of the trilogy which wasn\'t written or adapted from a draft by Rick Jaffa/Amanda Silver, who retrospectively had a better understanding of the franchise\'s allegorical implications than Reeves/Bomback (who wrote this film). Now, Reeves knows how to create a brilliantly-layered story (not sure about Bomback), but his efforts left much to be desired in the way of commentary/allegory. There are clear (and often brutal) allusions to the Holocaust, with depictions of scapegoating minorities for predicaments the accuser is guilty of. In the way of contemporary commentary, the humans are trying to build a wall which ultimately proves useless (remind you of anything?). All in all though, it doesn\'t reflect the series\' core allegory of racism very well, presenting nothing especially insightful or impressive. The final culprits are a handful of ""Did they really just do that?"" plot conveniences, mainly the tunnels with conveniently placed holes, but where the writing actually thrives in this film is structure.In War, we\'re presented with an abundance of reversals/reflections on the former films\' themes. Consider that for the first time since Rise, Caesar finds himself in a cage and inciting a revolution. We also see him abused with water, and fed slop. Also consider the dramatic irony/poetic justice of the virus: designed by humans, activating the speech centers/enhancing intelligence for apes, now doing the precise opposite for humans, effectively switching their roles in a quite literal interpretation of Planet of the Apes\' core reversal. Additionally, Alpha Omega isn\'t just an easter egg--it\'s about this film as the end of a trilogy and the beginning of a vast mythology, accentuating the motifs within the film.Character structure in War is also impressive. For example, Caesar kills Nova\'s father. This draws a parallel between Caesar and the Colonel (who previously killed Caesar\'s family). This turn not only reflects Caesar\'s disillusionment with humanity, but incites another parallel with his former opponent, Koba. Note that the now-orphaned Nova is a reflection of young Caesar, growing up and learning to sign with the reverse species. The performances are strong all-around, and there\'s not much new to be said (also I\'m butting heads with IMDb\'s word limit). I\'ll add that I really enjoyed the tragic/comedic character of Bad Ape, and that Serkis was brilliant yet again.I still find Doyle\'s score for Rise to be the best of the trilogy, but Giacchino manages a noticeable improvement from his work on Dawn. Though still simple in orchestration, the music feels far more realized/developed here, and some nice new themes are added to the fold. I would have liked to hear more Goldsmith sensibilities (and Doyle\'s themes), but what we got was fantastic nonetheless.Not long after screening this film, I wanted to watch it again. Had this movie integrated more intelligent commentary and allegorical content, this could have been the second masterpiece within the Apes franchise, next to the 1968 film. I just hope that Fox keeps their damn dirty paws off my Apes until there\'s another story worth telling.Score: 9/10', 'Seriously needs to reevaluate the criteria by which they review films. Why? Because giving this film 1/10 says, ""I am ignorant of quality film making."" Descriptions like slow and boring just don\'t cut it! Opinions like this are an act of ultimate laziness - the inability to mentally invest in the passive experience of a film. An inability to invest in a well made film that has something to say no less.Everyone has the right to an opinion - but when a person abandons merit before their eyes, and quality film making is overlooked by choice? That is simply, unfortunate. I can continue to admonish those without taste, but what good is that?War for the Planet of the Apes isn\'t a good movie - it\'s a Great movie!!! I thought part one was above average, part two was surprisingly good - but this movie? Its a borderline classic!In a nutshell, War for the Planet of the Apes is a struggle for survival between Caesar\'s group of sentient apes (gorillas, orangutans), and a derelict group of soldiers led by a broken/crazed leader. This fight begins as open warfare but moves to very close quarter survival between captors and prisoners. There is a lot of heavy, dramatic sequences - and I would say this movie compromises entertainment for meaningful content. Normally I am very critical of this type of film, but not this time! Everything serves the characters and story - and in doing so becomes a project that far exceeds the sum of its parts. Yes this movie has death, suffering and plight - and it also has heroism, empathy and displays the strength of unity.The effects are astonishing - and immediately allow the viewer to slip into the world in a believable way. It is possible that this movie is 5 years ahead of its time. It may be a while before another film achieves this level of drama, all while being a heavily effect driven experience.Apparently this movie requires an active viewer. A person actually has to show up, absorb the content of a film that will not pander to selfish, ""give me action"" needs. More science fiction should be this brave and literate. I love movies that ask interesting questions and can bring you on an emotional adventure. It is surprising to me that the third film in this trilogy would improve so much on the previous two films - good movies in their own right.Way more I could talk up: great soundtrack! The music both blends in and adds to the drama/action - the best kind of soundtracking - beautiful camera work in interesting locations, and several unique characters, many of whom never utter a word of dialog! This movie is full of great character building, and all the big moments really land where they should.For me, best movie of the 2017 summer - maybe the year!All the 1* reviews at IMDb are a mystery... audience approval for this movie isn\'t this low. Very odd, anyways for those who care, critics got this one right - 9/10.', ""Don't normally review. Some like a film, some do not. But when I see this film given 1* I have to say something. Ignore such people. They enjoy the power of criticising the efforts of others while having, I imagine, little talent of their own. The film is a masterpiece. A war film, comedy, tragedy and biblical. What more can one ask for? Enjoy!"", ""Good and interesting movie. Glad I watched it. Story is simple and straight forward. It is the sequel of earlier Ape movies of Caesar. Writing any sentence about the story line is like spoiling the movie. So I will keep it short.Movie is worth watching. I enjoyed every frame of movie. Movie includes sentiments, emotion and revenge. I don't think any more sequel will be made of it. Movie is long, of 2 hours so you have to be patience and keep watching to know the end."", ""War for the Planet of the Apes is as near a perfect film as you'll ever get. It manages to surpass Dawn in just about every aspect, which is a huge achievement. The pacing is perfect, the score is phenomenal, and the CGI is out of this world. You can't give the special effects team enough credit, what they've done for this film is truly magnificent. Andy Serkis is oustanding as Caesar and I'm fully aboard the Oscar train! Woody Harrelson plays a great villain and is owner of the one and only expositional scene in the film. It truly is a masterpiece and caps off the trilogy like I never thought possible. A remarkable film."", 'The security guard and the key! what bugged me the most was that scene ...in the entire movie...just dumb, like what am i ... 11 years old watching this film???! yeah why not let the apes throw poop at the guard who happens to be standing above the cage> let the guard get mad and go down to them> have him walk into the effing cage with the keys> locks him self there with all the apes > and you know what happens next, they beat him and they steal the keys that led the infamous prison break!', ""I was first reluctant to see this film when my friend invited me but after seeing that it has a whopping 8.1 rating and remembering that the previous films were quite enjoyable I was prepared to see a truly good movie. I was incredibly disappointed. **SPOILERS** My first trouble with the film happened with the appearance of the little girl, who seemed to serve absolutely no purpose other than to spontaneously cause tear- jerking moments which were accompanied by sad music in every instance. Throughout the film there must have been around 10 of these, all of them completely pointless and forced. It also baffled me that she had close to 0 reaction to her father dying yet, when a gorilla who she had known for literally one day died, she wept like it was her brother. Another massive problem is that the entire plot of this movie hinges on one condition: that every single person out of the ~1,000 soldiers at the concentration camp is a complete and utter imbecile. Caesar's crew is running around right outside of the walls of the camp? Of course no one notices, why would anyone be on over-watch at a military base? All of the monkeys escape from their cages? Of course there was only one person watching over them. In addition to that, for the duration of what seemed like 10 minutes no one else even noticed that all the monkeys were gone or that the single guard watching over them was killed. Are these real soldiers!? Even statistically, what are the chances that not a single soldier looked at a cage that is in plain view from any part of the camp. These were just the most glaring issues I had with the film. So little thought went into the script. These are incredibly basic problems which could have been fixed with even the slightest effort, This movie was so incredibly dumb that even my friend who doesn't have much interest in film asked me if I wanted to leave before the film was over."", 'This is the third chapter of the acclaimed Planet of the Apes franchise. Matt Reeves directs and this episode that is nice on the eyes to watch. Enough activity to keep your interest and story line that moves along at a good pace for a two hour twenty minute movie.Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his apes are goaded into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a devious, head-strong Colonel (Woody Harrelson). Caesar tangles with his inner, dark instincts and comes to grips with his own mythical stature avenging his own kind. He comes face to face with the Colonel as bitter challengers in a battle that will determine the fate of both species. Ape versus Man and the future of the planet.Really impressive is Steve Zahn playing Bad Ape. Also in the cast are: Amiah Miller, Judy Greer, Aleks Paunovic, Karin Konoval, Toby Kebbell and Michael Adamthwaite.', 'The movie truly delves into the quote of ""Ape shall not kill ape"", as we see Caesar slowly transgressing into the cloud of darkness, and abandoning all of his ambitions and love. Caesar is haunted by the memory of Koba and the quote previously mentioned, and, as the movie progresses, Caesar\'s love of humans dies along with his family and other apes, making him become similar to Koba. Throughout the movie, the audience soon realises that the movies are not about ""The Planet of the Apes"" anymore, but about a deeper issue of Caesar and his character\'s mind and thoughts. And, even Caesar seems to value his personal quests rather than the larger goal.The setting and photography are magnificent, making it hard to tell what is CGIed and what isn\'t. But, without the perfect visual effects, the movie would not have half the impact it had, with every single hair being done to precise measurement, you can even see the graying of Caesar\'s hair as he grows old and weary, with the tips tinged with white to represent the snow and ice forming on his body. Gunshots seem realistic and wrinkles on the apes give perfect contrast to the precise detail and architecture of their face. You can even notice the bags under their eyes! But, being a dedicated fan, as most who see this movie are, the tie-ins and \'nods\' to the original ""Planet of the Apes"" are natural, unforced tie-ins, adding to the experience as a fan even more-so than a new customer to the ""Apes"" franchise.Easily being one of the best ""Planet of the Apes"" movies, this does not disappoint, whether you are in search of action, vendetta, emotional drama or just to the see sequel to ""Dawn"". The darkest and most tempting movie in the franchise: ""War for the Planet of the Apes"".', 'This a great movie. Down of the planet of the apes is better. But still this movie has great acting. It also has a great story line. 7.5 is underrating this movie I give it 9 out of 10.', ""Writing was weak .this was a missed opportunity I was looking for an epic finale to this film series but instead we got this .it's fine I guess .it should have been awesome but it was only ok"", 'My only complaint about this movie is that I became so addicted to it, that I had to buy it! I can watch it over and over again.', ""This is undoubtedly the weakest of all the 3 movies. But I believe in seeing as overall prospective. Not just the message and that regards I didn't thought it wasn't absolutely awful. In this film the role of Apes can easily be replaced any terrorist organizations in the world. Even they complaint that they are fighting for survival, for protection, society made them bla bla bla. But should we allow them to eradicate mankind? Secondly world is not so small. There is a world beyond US. So I I'm confuse. Was this movie about war between Apes verses mankind or Apes verses US. To imagine that an avalanche can destroy entire humanity is laughable. At the end I was wondering where are other humans? I was certainly expecting a showdown between Apes and Mankind. But it never happened. Overall I went in to the movie expecting 10 but returned with a 6. The good thing about the film was CGI effect. It was really goo and at no point it was over done. 3D effects were good. There were some scenes that was really intense and created tension. But overall it didn't hold onto it.Message was of the film left lots of unanswered questions."", 'WATCH IT! brilliant in every way...This is 10...fake comments bringing it down..............', 'Humans bad, apes good. This thesis sums up the first half of the movie, harped on so heavily and in such a clichied manner that I lost interest in continuing. And apes, of which chimps are the most violently aggressive and unpredictable. La-La land for the self-loathing.Having said that, the movie looks fantastic.', 'I\'ve seen the original Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowell, I\'ve seen the remake with Tim Roth, I\'ve seen thousands of films during my life. War for the Planet of the Apes seemed to me as simply a showcase for the digital ape effects.It\'s full of closeups of different digital ape faces against a blurry background. Af if it\'s 1957 and we should be marveling at new Disneyland animatronic characters. It\'s full of distant shots of digital chimps scurrying around. That\'s most of the movie.What people are saying is thought provoking, is a simple illustration of two groups in conflict. Draw comparisons to Nazis and Jews, black and white, Shia and Shi\'ite, slave and slave owner. The same ""thought provoking"" questions arise.The only difference here is that it\'s put into a science fiction context - what if apes were as smart as humans? Well, what if cats were? Or squirrels? Had this been an action film, I\'d say OK, it\'s an action movie and it\'s fine. But it isn\'t. It has some action, but is not an action film. It\'s mostly a very slow moving, dull, inarticulate drama.Inarticulate in two ways. A lot of the apes use sign language instead of speech, and the script is not clever or intellectual. A few flashes of well written dialog come up during an exchange between the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) and Caesar (digital ape) and that\'s all there is. Less than five minutes. The rest of the dialog is mainly focused on vengeance and war or merciful understanding. There\'s no complexity or intellectual stimulation here.I\'m shocked that nearly all professional film critics give this movie a high rating and praise. Perhaps they all received $5,000 checks from the film studio.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A young Mel Gibson plays a lawman in a near-future, gang infested Australia. His encounters with a especially vile gang result in a deadly attack on his wife and infant son, and the last act of the movie focuses on his single-minded payback on those responsible.Mad Max is certainly low-budget, but the movie doesn\'t really suffer from it. It is dated, however, and so many movies with similar premises have been made in the last thirty years that this one doesn\'t make nearly as much of an impression now as it probably did back in 1979. Watching this is a near-requirement for fans of Mel Gibson, but for everyone else, it\'s a decent movie that should be seen more for its classic status than its current entertainment value.', 'I remember my parents being such fans of Mad Max when I was a kid, but the movie looked so boring in my eyes. I never really wanted to get into it, I mean, I was a kid after all. But a few years ago in my film appreciation class, we were watching clips from Mad Max 2 when studying Australian films and I was intrigued with it. I finally remembered a few weeks ago how I wanted to see the three movies, so I just watched Mad Max and I have to say that I understand it\'s cult following. Mad Max promises and delivers, it\'s a low budget action film, but has a terrific story and excellent stunts. Mel Gibson, before he was Mel Gibson in Hollywood, you could see why he made it so big, his presence on screen is truly hypnotic and he makes a great hero. This story is so scary in the fact that I don\'t think that we are far from this future.Max Rockatansky lives in a time where his country has been taken over by violent, vicious motorcycle gang members who just go around torturing and killing people. Max and a few friends are the last members of the ""semi"" police force that is trying to get things back under control and bring some peace to their town. But when the gang messes with Max\'s friend by nearly burning him alive, Max is ticked and goes after them. But when the gang messes with Max\'s wife and child and kills them, oh, they\'ve gone too far and now it\'s personal.Mad Max\'s plot is basic and can be considered typical, but it\'s a fun action movie that truly delivers. The action sequences were really exciting, especially Max\'s revenge sequence, he was so amazing and I don\'t remember the last time I rooted so hard for the good guy to win. Mel Gibson was really cool and I had a good time watching Mad Max. I\'m looking forward to the sequels. I would recommend this movie for a watch, it\'s a fun cult classic that I\'m sure any action fan would enjoy.7/10', 'The year was 1979. And out of Australia, of all places, comes this post-doomsday yarn about a world gone bad, starring a completely unknown Aussie hunk named Mel Gibson (this would be decades before he became Hollywood\'s ""bete noire"" and tried to share his novel views on racial differences with the world) and a hitherto unknown director named George Miller. Well, to call the film historical is like saying that John Wayne used to do westerns. Gibson ultimately became, well, for lack a better term, himself. Miller went on to not only sequels but also a number of astonishing films and would eventually pick up an Oscar";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It follows a divorced, mild-mannered psychology professor, Gary Johnson (Glen Powell), who lives alone with his two cats, Id and Ego. He has also worked part-time with the New Orleans Police Department as a technical advisor on some undercover operations. Suddenly, Jasper (Austin Amelio), the guy who usually plays the undercover role of a hitman, is suspended, and Claudette (Retta) and Phil (Sanjay Rao) co-opt Gary to fill in. Gary proves amazingly skilled at his job with his forgettable face, many disguises, and believable sales pitch. Nonetheless, Gary\'s ex-wife (Molly Bernard) encourages him to liven up his personality.Suddenly, Gary meets Madeline Masters (Adria Arjona), a beautiful young woman who wants to have her husband, Ray (Evan Holtzman), killed. Rather than trap her, Gary encourages her to flee her husband and begin her own life. Soon, Gary and Maddy begin a relationship in which she still believes Gary is a hitman, and Gary\'s police colleagues are unaware of his relationship with a potential suspect. The movie then unfolds through many twists and turns that threaten their relationship and their trust in one another.""Hit Man"" is a supremely clever story loosely based on a real Gary Johnson in Houston. It has a romantic comedy edge against a film noir backdrop. Powell and Arjona have excellent chemistry. The script lags a little in the middle but sprints to the end and has a good film noir ending.', ""Rotten Tomatoes gives this movie an unbelievable 98%. The first hour is slow and repetitive and completely unbelievable despite its being based on a real person. But that real person was a real investigator not just a tech guy who filled in unexpectedly one day. The legal stuff is ridiculous. As if multiple murder convictions would take place in a matter of months. And police witnesses don't sit in court throughout a trial. There was little chemistry despite the best efforts of the female lead actress. It did finally get a little more interesting a hour in but any originality was squandered by the trite ending."", 'I am baffled by the critical praise for this movie. The much lauded ""chemistry"" between the two leads was either pushed by the studio or the result of the female lead acting as if she was on the verge of orgasm for most of her screen time. The movie is undeniably well made, the leads are enormously attractive, and there a few chuckles. The scene with the cellphone texts tipping off the female leads as the cops listened was amusing for sure. The female detective was great throughout - great comedic timing. But this is definitely a wait-until-its-free-on-your-favorite-streaming-channel kind of film. You\'ll be pleasantly entertained.Spoiler: how are you supposed to root for the couple after they kill the detective in a most horrific way, the detective being only character smart enough to see through them? Was he supposed to be the bad guy instead of the actual two-time killer because he is made to appear unattractive and she is....pretty?Would have been better with a little more Double Indemnity, a little less Hart to Hart.', ""This film was a ton of fun - a smart script, witty dialogue, lots of laughs, lots of twists and turns, two incredibly watchable stars with great chemistry, and some interesting themes on who we are and our capacity to change. Glen Powell is on a meteoric rise and will be an A-lister in no time (he cowrote the screenplay?! Super impressive)Honestly they don't make many movies like this these days - it's a clever screwball dark comedy with some whodunit elements that ropes you right in.

That's not what this film is. There are some similarities (a tough guy saving a roadhouse from a greedy rich guy) but it's different film with different themes and a different atmosphere and Jake Gyllenhaal is stellar in the role of Dalton, a kind, brooding guy who has a lethal aspect which scares him.Right now, this film has a 6.2 on IMDb, which I think under rates it. If you look at this without the lens of the original Roadhouse, it stands well enough on its own to be worth more than that."", ""This Road House remake had its parallels to the original but put a totally different spin on it to create a completely fresh story. The bad guy, like the original, was a businessman in a suit, but the climactic showdown was against UFC fighter Conor McGregor's Knox. The fight between Dalton and Knox at the end is one of my favorites in recent history. Jake Gyllenhaal only had a few kick ass scenes since most of the remake focused on Dalton's internal struggle to a past traumatic event that wasn't explored in the original. In all, I liked this Road House just about as much as the original, and I strongly recommend this to all action fans."", ""I don't understand the bad reviews for this. It's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and it's obvious literally from the very beginning that it's self-aware. It knows how to laugh at itself with its over the top fight scenes and at times bad and cheesy dialogue or even the constant wild music being played in the background. Even the way Conor Mcgregor walked and talked was not serious in itself. I mean come on, it's impossible to hate on a film like this. Sure, some movies that don't take themselves seriously can still be very bad, but this one was actually pretty alright if you don't compare it to the original or just go into it with lower expectations. I'd definitely recommend this as a fun popcorn action flick if you're bored."", ""The film has a different structure compared to the first version, it has some similarities, but it is not completely the same. I really liked JAKE's portrayal of the character and Dalton's character, though. In ridiculous places, especially in some of the fight scenes. The use of CGi was annoying and very noticeable, especially in the PostMalone scene. I liked it, but apparently our movie tastes have changed a bit, and I don't like action-oriented movies like I used to. He came, beat everyone, left and it was over. The 80s and 90s were okay, but after the digital platform movies came out, we got used to watching more intelligent scenarios. A very simple subject was discussed: bad guy, good guy, fight, good guy wins."", '""Road House"" feels like the highest budget \'made for TV\' movie ever. Despite the money thrown at it, blockbuster director, and casting of Jake Gyllenhaal the movie overall falls completely flat with awful dialogue, uninteresting characters, and a storyline so thin you can see through it.The only positive about this movie is there were some very creative shots in the fight scenes, but even those were relatively uneven. And Connor McGregor was given far too much (poorly written) dialogue which combined with his vapid delivery takes you right out of the movie.Overall it feels like ""Road House"" was the product of someone giving a 13 year old boy absolute control of a Hollywood production. The upside to this is the chaotic mess they left behind is somewhat entertaining.', ""Casting felt very forced which pulls you out of the story. Jake does a good job. Some of the fighting scenes were interesting. You could tell this was a very new Hollywood update of a classic movie. Some of the dialogue needed work.McGregor was also an odd choice. His permanent smiling expressions and him walking like he had hemorrhoids was very hard to move past. Sometimes you couldn't understand what he was even saying.Overall the movie was fun and if youre looking for a time killer its an okay option but I would probably just stick to the classic movie where the story and characters feel less contrived."", 'I have not seen the original road house, but really liked this version of it. It was full of action and did not take itself to seriously. Great camera work in fight scenes and overall a fun to watch movie. My eyes were glued to the screen most of the time and even if I knew where the plot was going I wanted to see how the fight scenes would play out. It is not a new all time classic. The plot is fairly simple, but also unique because of the backstory of Gyllenhaals character. Gyllenhaal is a great actor and carries the movie with his acting skills. Mcgreggors character was a little over the top, which worked for me. As he was a real threat to Gyllenhaals character and everyone else, because he was so unpredictable and did not care for anything or more specific anyone. Overall a great movie full of action packed raw fight scenes that I would definitely recommend.', 'What is all the online hate about this film? I\'ve constantly been seeing all over the internet about how bad this film is but.... It\'s decent?!The CGI was a bit choppy in 3 scenes I noticed: The first fight scene with post malone, the scene where dalton was hit by the truck and it fell off the bridge into the water, & lastly the yacht explosion scene in the middle of the oceanConors acting was exaggerated, sure, but it fit his character SO well. It was like he was coked out of his mind the whole film, it really gave his character that ""CRAZY"" aura. For his first film, he did a decent job.The storyline was a bit corny though, for a film being 2 hours long, you could have made it a bit more interesting rather than the usual ""drug bad guys want to take over"" kind of movie.But apart from that, I enjoyed it. I feel like a lot of the online hate is just coming from Conor McGregor haters, I mean some of the hate reviews I read were so blown out of proportion...SOLID 7/10.', ""I was expecting a fun action movie, and it started well. Jake is great (as youd expect), and so are most of the supporting cast.There are also some fun moments and lines. But then Conor Mcgregor turns up and it goes down hill fast. He really can't act, and just stomps around spouting cringe one liners that he can't pull off. You'd also expect at least his fight scenes to be good, but they weren't.With another actor in the Mcgregor role this could have been a great action movie.The fight scenes are hit and miss with some looking very fake with some bad cgi at times too. In fact the cgi is pretty poor in general."", ""Road House (2024) serves up a nostalgic punch of action-packed entertainment. With nods to the original and fresh twists, this reboot revs up the adrenaline with intense fight scenes and charismatic performances. While it occasionally veers into cliché territory, it's saved by its undeniable charm and stylish direction. Fans of the classic will find plenty to enjoy, but newcomers may also be won over by its gritty, high-energy vibe. Overall, Road House (2024) delivers a satisfying cocktail of nostalgia and modern flair, making it a worthy addition to the franchise.In my opinion was ok/good movie maybe not the best."", ""If there's anything good to say about the 2024 remake of Road House, is that it will get people reaching for the classic 1989 movie to cleanse the palette and the more people who watch the original the better, as it is simply a brilliant film.Sadly, I can't say the same about this steaming pile of double deuce I have just witnessed. Is it even a remake? The similarities between the two are sparse. The main character is a bouncer named Dalton and he's hired by a bar owner to 'bounce'..... that's it, the only thing that would even make you think this was a remake.Missouri is replaced with Florida, mullets are replaced with bullet heads and actors are replaced with Conor McGregor and Billy Magnussen.With the occasional exception, (and I mean VERY occasional), remakes always fail. A lot of the time it's because they are being judged, at times unfairly, against the original. Others are simply bad movies trying to cash in on an illustrious name. 2024's Road House definitely falls in the latter category.In 1989, the Double Duece was a bar that Dalton was hired to clean up because of the trouble makers that frequented it, the fact that the entire town was being run by a crime kingpin running a protection racket. Is just an extra problem he encounters and has to deal with.In 2024, Dalton is hired BECAUSE of the crime kingpin, who wants to demolish the bar to realise his his real estate ambitions and Dalton isn't told about this until he runs foul of the goon squad sent to intimidate the bar and its patrons.At least in the Double Duece there was usually reasons fights broke out. In the Florida Road House, people seem to pick fights because the guy next to him was turning oxygen into carbon dioxide too loudly.To be fair to Jake Gyllenhaal, he does turn in a good performance given what he has to work with and he is the best thing in the entire movie. However, one thing is unforgivable, the CGI/AI action, it looks fake, cheap and takes you out of that reality instantly.The character of Dalton has also been changed. Patrick Swayze's Dalton was good man, firmly in control of his emotions and attitude to life, spirituality and clinical in his profession. Gyllenhaal's Dalton is not even a bouncer to start with, he's an ex UFC fighter hustling the illegal fight circuit for PIN money who falls into 'bouncing' by chance and while occasionally getting involved in the action, he seems to be collecting $5000 a week for sitting down at the bar watching all the other 'bouncers' do the grunt work for him under his 'guidance'. He is also mentally disturbed and sometimes can't keep a lid on it. He is also suicidal...for about 2 minutes at the start, never to be mentioned again.To show how unhinged this new Dalton is, he plants a bomb on a boat that is moored to a yacht that his girlfriend is held hostage on, and then detonates it remotely when they're still on board. You see, explosions are funny things, they're unpredictable and Dalton would have had no way of knowing whether that yacht would sink in 10 minutes or 10 seconds, a hell of a risk to take with an innocent life.Now let's talk about two people I briefly mentioned earlier, Conor McGregor and Billy Magnussen. Jeez they are bad? McGregor is so over the top that any realism that this person could actually exist in real life is gone in a second. You've heard of over egging the pudding? Well here we have no pudding at all, just lots of egg.Magnussen is as equally bland as he is bad. Again, this may not be his fault and the blame can certainly be placed on the script, as in one scene, he is seen getting a shave on the stern of his yacht in choppy seas, and the barber is using a cutthroat razor of all things and this absolute idiot seems shocked that he's getting hacked to bits by the barber with every stroke. I mean what did he think was going to happen?2024's Road House is an OK action flick that suffers more for trying to pass itself off as a remake of a bonefide classic.....a bonefide classic I am now going to go and watch as it's always been a rewatchable favourite. However, I'm not going to be watching this version again anytime soon....if ever.Enjoy!"", ""I wasn't really interested in watching this reboot. Seriously, it wasn't going to stand up to the original. There was no way at all! Finally, after prodding and poking I caved and discovered it that it didn't need to.The characters were strong, and the plot different enough to make me feel like I was still being faithful to the original version.Well worth the watching! With perfect casting and great site choices, it was a believable film. I will be waiting for a part II and hoping that Elwood Dalton will continue being an underestimated good guy!Thank you to Gyllenhal for paying such wonderful respect to a great man with one of his tattoos."", ""Swayze will be turning in his grave. What started off decent quickly turns to absolute muck. The story is very poor but with the appearance of Conor Mcgregor and quite possibly the worst acting performance ever seen with that ridiculous swagger and stupid grin the movie goes downhill FAST. Whoever cast him ruined any potential this remake of an 80's classic ever had.Another ridiculous remake of good old 80's movies, this remake and Point Break up there with two of the worst ever, what did Swayze do wrong to get two of his cult movies murdered by remakes. Honestly don't even waste your time with this."", 'Enjoyable fun movie. But massively over the top action when it really didnt need to be. Clearly connor mcgregor wrote in his contract he wasnt allowed to die because the terminator wouldnt have survived that many kill scenes.The original movie, bit by bit, the bar gets cleaned up and the feel good factor slowly kicks in, this was massively missing from this remake.Jake is solid as an actor as always. But mcgregor looked sluggish and stupid.So much potential to modernise a classic but let down and disappointing. Story line to much over the place and rushed. Which is mad considering it was a remake.', 'Jack Gyllenhaal was good as always, he proves again in every movie that he is a good and talented actor. There was Post Malone and Conor McGregor in movie, Post Malone just had short scene at the beginning of the movie. Conor McGregor popped up after half of the movie and In my opinion, he mastered this role but, role was not that hard is already a fighter and he animated a fighter. Fighting scenes were good enough, it was not exaggerated. If we talk about the storyline, it is smooth and decent. While I watching, I did not get bored, It was not a masterpiece and of course I did not expect this but this movie is definitely not bad.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

So in one instance, here\'s where technology, specifically the use motion- capture technology as seen in ""Avatar,"" can almost single-handedly justify revisiting an old franchise. But the apes of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" don\'t just look amazing — they have souls. So does this script, which delivers one of the summer\'s biggest surprises in terms of pure entertainment and depth of storytelling.Unlike the ""Transformers"" franchise, where giant steel-crushing robots have gotten lost in inane plots driven by pointless human characters, ""Rise"" keeps the primates as an almost exclusive focus. Somewhere close to the midpoint, humans even take a back seat to the captivating ape-centered story arcs crafted by writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver. Not only do apes most definitely rise in this movie, but they also do so with clear tremendous purpose. The story of how a potential cure for Alzheimer\'s went out of control couldn\'t be more crystal clear, as is the reasoning that inspires an ape named Caesar to incite a rebellion.James Franco plays scientist Will Rodman, who\'s experimenting with his Alzheimer\'s cure on apes. His most recent tests show incredible cognitive abilities in one ape and so he makes a presentation to the company\'s board asking for permission to test the drug on humans. Things go wrong during the presentation, however, when the ape goes, well — ape — and on display for the whole lab. The apes are ordered to be put down and Franco\'s entire operation gets shut down.However, the trial ape had been hiding a newborn baby. Will secretly takes it home where his father (John Lithgow) suffers from Alzheimer\'s. Turns out the chimp, which his father names Caesar, inherited the cognitive abilities of the drug through its mother. As Caesar grows and exhibits tremendous mental growth (including helping Will land an otherwise pointless girlfriend in Freida Pinto), Will desperately tests the drug on his father and suddenly he has hope for the project to continue.This origin story plays out for most of the film, but Caesar ends up becoming the focus. Although he says nothing, he generates incredible sympathy through consummate mo-cap actor Andy Serkis (Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings""). Add to that the burgeoning scientific moral dilemma and ""Rise"" builds quite the captivating story. The turning points for Caesar that result in and arise from his inhumane captivity all wield the impact that pivotal moments should carry in all films. Despite a story that originated almost 45 years ago, the script lays this perfect and scientifically reasonable foundation for the ""Planet of the Apes"" we already know. The only thing that feels like a reach is the speed with which the apes develop certain tactical abilities once they all receive the drug.Director Rupert Wyatt definitely understands the script handed to him as he provides the appropriate magnitude to these effective plot points and knows how to create mouth-agape moments. When Oyewolo\'s character arrives at the lab cafeteria to find a bunch of tables overturned, Wyatt pans up to reveal he\'s surrounded by apes. There\'s no reason to think they weren\'t there waiting for him, but we\'re caught off guard just long enough to know he better make a run for it. Those are the ""glory shots"" that make a true blockbuster.Much of the action used to promote the movie comes in the film\'s final act, which uses all the slowly building tension from scenes showing cruelty toward the apes in the second act to fuel the fire. With such strong motivation accumulated during these first two chunks of the film, the action doesn\'t have to be that explosive or visceral in order to be effective. Apes tearing humans limb for limb would have certainly made for a more interesting film to say the least, but ""Rise"" manages to get away with the tamer action due to all the powerful setup and Wyatt provokes some imagination-inspired gore. In addition, the fact that the apes just knock people unconscious serves the script\'s efforts to show how — just like humans — some apes are violent and evil in nature while some are sympathetic and merciful. The film expertly muddles our perception of who to root for in this sense.Considering prequels inherently risk their quality on the fact that we know the end result, it\'s impressive that ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" maintains our interest consistently throughout. The ending does leave something to be desired because it ends just as the battle between apes and humans seems to be going somewhere, but even though I\'m not sure what would happen (or what the title would be for that matter), if the sequel picks up right where this left off — count me in.~Steven C', 'Let me begin by saying this movie is decently watchable. It\'s probably one of the best films this summer yet the competition isn\'t very strong. However, strength is one thing the plot is missing dearly. In the original Planet of the Apes series, the issue of the apes vs. humans was supposed to parallel the civil rights movement, which was in full swing at the time they were being produced. There were deep themes and heavy topics to deal with. This movie, however, appears to be produced by PETA, and only serves to make you feel sorry for the plight of the apes, I suppose so you will root for them when they gain their freedom. Also, the original series never explained how the apes evolved to become more human, just that a nuclear war wiped out humans for the most part. This film decides that a super virus kills everyone eventually. Many scenes are so overdone and flat out inaccurate that they literally had me laughing out loud in the theater. Apes and other primates can\'t talk because they lack certain physical features in the throat. Guess what? Caesar, the main ape, learns to speak, and he\'s about as eloquent as an English school teacher at the end. I fully expected him to give a victory speech during the last 3 minutes. This movie claims to have a 90 million dollar budget, and considering that it\'s about 50% cgi with all the apes, you have to wonder what they spent the other 10 million on. Franco comes across as nearly illiterate, like the dumb jock in high school that is reading ""big words"" out loud in class. He also drives a complete piece of crap in the movie that is at odds with his badass rich research scientist job. I\'m not even going into the pointless girlfriend and the fact that nobody aged a day in 5 years. Speaking of his job... The company, Gen-sys (get it) has the worst security known to man. You\'d think if they were doing research on chimps, which are roughly 10x stronger than humans, they\'d have the appropriate security measures in place and a failsafe lockdown for the floor they\'re on. Instead, they have an open-door, roam where you will policy that basically serves as an escalator to the downstairs lobby. Shatterproof or bulletproof glass? Nope. Not at this company. At one point, Porkins, our favorite bumbling chimp handler, hits a button on the wall and you fully expect the building to go into lockdown mode, with big bomb doors and whatnot. It doesn\'t happen. It\'s not even designed to happen. Biohazard outbreak? It\'s shocking it hasn\'t happened yet at that place. The main character\'s dad is a nice, but predictable, break in the action, and everyone can see what\'s going to happen to him coming from a mile away. He\'ll get cured, then the cure will fail, then insert-tired-plot-device-here. Some of the scenes with him and the neighbor were so clichéd it\'s surprising nobody caught it in post and said hey, how about we leave this out. Like other reviews have said, the apes are the real stars of this film, and the magical smoke bomb that turns them into savants overnight is about the laziest plot device imaginable. Some of the scenes in the ape house are fun (setting Buck free and Caesar becoming dominant) and honestly this is the real meat of the film. Once the apes break out, they go on an organized and terrifying rampage. However, if you\'re like me, you\'ll wonder just how many apes are in and around San Francisco. Looks like hundreds at some points. Overall, it\'s not a bad film, but it smacks of the current stock coming out of Hollywood. It\'s cheesy, it\'s formulaic, it doesn\'t have strong acting or plot, and it just seems uninspired. If its main goal is to distract you from something else for 2 hours, it\'s perfect. If it strives to be even half as strong or thought-provoking as the original films, it falls flat on its face.', 'The movie was good, good to someone that is an apes fan - This film outpaced Tim Burtons ""Planet of the Apes"" (remake - http://www.flixster.com/movie/planet-of-the-apes#!lsrc:GSR-MOV-Title) by a long shot! This remake brought the story into the modern age and opened to door for several more to be made... of course, since it is a prequel to another ""Planet of the Apes"" remake. However, the continued making of these ""remakes"" says a lot about the creative talent of ""Hollywood""... like there is none. If you aren\'t paying attention you might miss both the launch of the ""mission to mars"" and the newspaper headlines ""mars mission missing""...', ""2011 is probably the year of the worst movies made ever. That said, in my personal ranking the Rise of the Planet of the Apes is hands down the worst one of the bunch. There is no real plot, the story is naive to heck and back. It's basically a patchwork of familiar themes which goes like that: Evil (greedy) corporation experiments on apes seeking profit, great noble doctor trying to find cure for Alzheimer to save his father, ape gets smarter, ape gets angry, ape unites the apes, steal serum and makes them smarter, apes beat the (censored) out of the SFPD and find freedom. Oh, and there's this evil ape which you'd think would confront the good ape, but at around 2/3 of the movie producer decides that they should leave room for a sequel (God forbid!) and the last vestiges of a plot wither and die. Oh, did I mention the hot chick which has no role or purpose? Check.The good, some good CGI on the apes (to balance things out the forest scenes are shot on a SDTV cam), and there are a lot of emotional ape cries/ape loves/ape hugs scenes a la 'awww, how cute'. That would appeal to the young female audience I am sure.So to conclude, if you thought the Planet of the Apes was a bad movie (I did), this one hit rock bottom and started digging. i still cannot stomach the current IMDb rating, but hey, vox populi rules the box office. You've been warned."", ""It's pretty hard to beat the original 1968's Planet of the Apes, but Rise of the Planet of Apes was just as entertaining as the original. Directed by Rupert Wyatt, its story is similar to the fourth film in the original series, 1972's Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, but it is not a direct remake in that it does not fit into that series' continuity. This movie was intended to act as an origin story for a new series of films. Anybody looking for armor men in ape make up capturing astronauts might want to look somewhere else. The movie is about Will Rodman (James Franco) a scientist at biotechnology lab testing viral-based drug on chimpanzees to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease.

Holy heaven, I was so surprised by GODZILLA MINUS ONE. In a year where both of my most anticipated movies turned out to be crummy disappointments (BARBIE and NAPOLEON), this movie-- a film I had no initial plans of seeing and had little enthusiasm for going into it-- blew me away.Godzilla is actually terrifying in this. The post-WWII setting was well-realized, with the characters exhausted after years of violence, destruction, and struggle. The characters were all relatable and interesting-- unlike other Godzilla movies I've seen, I cared intensely about their fates and was emotionally invested in the little found family they formed. And thank God for the lack of ironic jokes undercutting emotional scenes-- after so many trash Hollywood movies, I didn't even know it was possible for a blockbuster to be sincere like this anymore.Most of all, I love how life-affirming this film is. The cautious but persistent optimism is such a breath of fresh air. About my only criticism is that the ending twist is a little hokey... but to be honest, I can forgive that. The movie is too good for me to complain about a happy ending."", 'Godzilla Minus One is an amazing spectacle on a retelling of a classic Kaiju movie from the prospective of a post-war Japanese veteran who leaves one horror for the next while making an arrangement of ""friends and family"" along the way. The story was so compelling that it didn\'t feel like two hours past and I was craving for more. The classic Godzilla sounds design, masterful cinematography, along with the original score from Akira Ifukube made this movie an absolute masterpiece on storytelling! The visuals of the Godzilla update made him more memorable and menacing for the citizens of a distraught Tokyo. Highly recommended!', ""From the opening to the ending, I was enthralled by the whole movie. It kept everything that I loved about Godzilla, and was able to make an extremely interesting backstory with the human characters. There was a lot of things that was addressed in this movie that I had never seen before.there was so many things that people will pick apart, but that's upon reflection. I had no criticisms or a reason to dislike this movie the whole time I watched it. So, in that respect, I will give it a perfect score. And I don't go slinging those out just every review. As a Godzilla fan, this was perfection to me."", ""Without spoiling anything, this movie hit different from any other. It felt much more serious and quite a bit darker at times. The movie was amazing, the effects were great. I never thought I'd see a Godzilla movie where people were crying in the theater. It was quite the experience. Godzilla was truly an unstoppable force in this movie, whenever Godzilla would show up it was hard to feel anything but futility. Even in the rare event that Godzilla was injured he was only slowed down. This version of Godzilla might be more evil than Shin Godzilla though his motives are hard to understand where shin Godzilla it became apparent."", ""GODZILLA MINUS ONE (2023) **** Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Sakura Ando, Yuki Yamada, Kuranosuke Sasake, Hidetaka Yaoshioka, Yuya Endo, Saki Nakatani. Director Takashi Yamazaki's Herculean efforts of reviving the Kaiju franchise is effortlessly awesome and absolutely top-tier filmmaking with the origin story of the gigantic monster showing up off the shores of post WWII Japan as it engages a full-tilt invasion of Tokyo and its environs with atypical destruction and death. Key to the film's strength is the plot involving ex-kamikaze pilot Kamiki (suffering arguably cinema's most poignant PTSD) and love interest Hamabe as a make-shift family attempting to survive with the thread of a palpable redemption narrative laced with surprisingly heartfelt emotion. The clean visual f/x propel the radioactive creature is jaw-droppingly astounding with some neat extras (his spiny back igniting as it re-charges its nuclear energies is eye-poppingly epic). One of the year's best films."", ""Set at the end of World War 2 and Japan is defeated and in ruins. Our protagonist is Koichi, a pilot who returns to his devastated hometown in Tokyo. He is unwelcome and guilt ridden for sneaking out of a kamikaze raid in the pacific. Japan is at its lowest point and then Godzilla arrives.This is a brilliant setup for this period story that sees a country without the military might, technology and morale to face this new enemy. The film also leans into the drama and emotion that made the first film so iconic and sets it apart from the family fun films of the 70s and 80s as well as the recent American blockbuster treatments. My Japanese is not good enough to understand all of the film so there will be lots that I didn't get. However it manages to be a strong, emotional story with a scary and ferocious Godzilla. In my mind it is far superior to Shin Godzilla which I found dull and goofy. This is the best Godzilla film in many years and perhaps the best since the 1954 original."", ""I don't know what kind of mind state some of these raving reviewers were at but this was the most boring Godzilla I've seen yet. There was some great special effects and scenery but everything else just sucked. The acting was horrible, the characters were annoying, the pace was glacial and the dialogue was just idiotic. This movie is worth a single viewing and then straight to the trash bin. I ended up fast forwarding the majority of the movie once I realized it was mostly pointless filler. This movie wasted far too much time on character development instead of focusing more on Godzilla. It's a pity, this movie had great potential that went to waste."", ""Godzilla Minus One is one of the best Godzilla films in recent time. It gave me everything i wanted for the first time ever I was actually invested in the human characters and their story normally you are just waiting for Godzilla to show up but not here Godzilla shows up alot and when he does he is BRUTAL. This Godzilla makes things personal by actively attacking the humans. The movie had great pacing where it doesn't feel like it's going on for too long and it was nice to have a darker story set after WW2. It really goes back to the franchise's roots. There's so much to say but it would give a lot away JUST SEE THE MOVIE ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE 9/10."", ""Went to watch this movie with huge expectations, I've heard and read amazing reviews so I was expecting a lot.It's an okay movie, I do find the review a bit bias and calling Hollywood movies bad based on this one is an exaggeration.The plot is so overdone, in Japan and in the US. We have seen this story many many times. It was very predictable and very slow. I found myself a bit bored and wanting for it to end.There were multiple things I like, the characters are likable, there is a good post war feeling between people caring for each other. The characters were one of the things I liked. I like that they didn't need to call anyone to defeat Godzilla, that was nice.My main issue was the editing and plot. I feel if it was cut properly it could have been and hour and half movie instead of a two hours dreadful movie. Also the logistics of the movie annoyed me, the war boats moving so fast, them connecting all the boats to the warship boats in seconds, the coincidence of the main character being in the train when Godzilla attacks, the main character casually finding the girl in the middle of a huge chaos? This is very 90s, if a movie has such a rating and such praise it needs to be better. The acting was also extremely dramatic. I constantly watch Japanese shows and movies and it's overdone but this was was insane.Another issue for me was the CG, not the best Godzilla model I've seen, compared to the one in Kong vs Godzilla.Overall I'm annoyed by the overhype, a movie rated this high should be better, it's rated there with parasite, fight club and game of thrones. Those are masterpieces, and I would say this is just not it."", 'Finally a Godzilla movie with interesting and developed characters, for this point it\'s certainly the best of the franchise.(Spoiler part) I also thought the death of one particular character was really surprising... Well, until she suddenly turns out to be alive at the end, in order to allow a happy ending. Kind of ruined the meaning of the death for the main character and emotion part (as the title ""Minus One"" can have a meaning for Japan overall AND specificaly the main hero).The idea to set the story in the 40\'s Japan is also interesting, as a foreigner i really discovered this post-war period of the country that i didn\'t really know about (i only saw Kurosawa\'s ""Subarashiki nichiyobi"" prior to this movie).The actions sequences are also very cool. You definitively won\'t be disapointed with them. I loved the treatment of the King of the Monsters, who have an interesting design and new ability (both are kind of linked).I saw it in a casual cinema, but i guess the IMAX version is worth it, so go for it if you got the chance.', ""I never watched a godzilla movie before in my life, and don't really care for such monster movies as they are based on zero reality. However, this movie, to me anyway, was more about post-war japan and its effects on society it had.. and about family during such hardships. Acting is decent, effects are pretty good, but few major storyline flaws are hard to ignore. A monster that destroys buildings like houses of cards is unable to rip up a cable that drags him to the ocen floor? That is weak mate. Anyhow, I know that such details are not the most important thing in this type of movie, but it would be nice if directors nowadays cared about making their movies a bit more beliveable to today's viewrship."", ""The story is set amidst the physical and emotional wreckage of Japan at the end of WW2 and just after. This realism is blended very well with a fictitious monster. For Japan, the war was not over.The unforgettable production utilizes some of the original Godzilla music. It is in Japanese with English subtitles.The story is pro-human. Seeing how people cared for each other in the midst of disaster is what moved me to tears. No snarky or edgy dialog or lame jokes that ruin so many Hollywood scripts in my opinion. Come to think of it, I can't remember a single humorous moment in the movie, though there were moments of joy and comraderie.It is a story about grass roots self-reliance and cooperation. Although some military men assist them, the Japanese realize that their government won't save them. Scientists and former military men come together, borrow some military equipment form a plan to defeat Godzilla.It is also a story about cowardice, the crippling shame that comes with it, and how cowardice can actually buy time for one to build one's courage. Remember what they say about backing away from a fight and staying alive so you can live to fight another day.I am not going to spoil it for you. Go see it."", ""Lulz Asians generally show little emotion on their faces, but when they see Godzilla, everything changes. They immediately show fear and despair better than anyone else.... Then they decide to shoot their guns at a Godzilla which is as big as ....... 380 feet or so? That's what Google is telling me. But\nit looks as big as an aircraft carrier. That's a lot more than 120 metres - it looks like it's about 300 metres long, which would be about 1000 feet. 120 meters? No way.There are incredible scenes in the ocean and when this thing walks through a city and hurls trains hundreds of metres away.....I don't know if this is the best Godzilla, perhaps it is, but Godzilla vs Kong was also pretty impressive. Go watch and decide yourself."", ""Yes, a Godzilla movie really is a candidate for the best film of the year. Godzilla Minus One is the best Godzilla movie of all time and even surpasses the original. This is more than a Godzilla movie, it is an examination of the human condition and humanity's effect on the natural world and the natural world's response as was the case with the original 1954 classic. In many Godzilla movies, the creature is cartoonish at best. Not this Godzilla. The monster is the best and most fearsome Godzilla of all-time. Although it does cover the post-war period in Japanese history as the original did, Godzilla Minus One takes a different approach to the story. This film should be nominated, if not win, the Oscar for Best Picture. If it is not nominated at least, the Academy should be rightfully criticized and criticized harshly for their choice."", ""I can't believe how and why people are enjoying this crap?!?!?CGI is no better than early 2000 movies, actings are horrible, almost like they just graduated acting school.There was a Japanese show back in 1980s called Oshin,it was like i was re-watching Oshin with a large lizard coming out from a corner every now and then killing some people in a stupid way and leaving.The Godzilla itself , why is it so small? It should be as tall as a skyscraper or something. A creature that large can snap a human in half with its teeth , but here no blood is shed when it bites people.The movie set is so fake and cheap you can't believe it for a second!So boring I dozed off in the middle and only woke up when my wife turned off the tv.I would not recommend watching this series to anyone."", 'Godzilla is back and is better than ever! This film is one of the best to date and is a personal favorite of mine. If you are a fan or new to Godzilla, I recommend this movie 100% and the visuals and CGI looked amazing. The CGI in this film is the best for any TOHO Godzilla film and even looks as good as the Hollywood Godzilla films for only a fraction of the budget! Overall, this is a perfect Godzilla movie to me and really takes him back to his roots to being a frightening force of nature/result of atomic weapons and is really a step up for the franchise in a long time.

My almost 80 year old parents know more about computers than these morons in the movies and many more examples of that.The action is great, as usual in Statham movies. That's why I even considered to write a review. It's everything one might expect from his action flick. As always he is the one who carries the movie throughout, and despite all the stupidity, it actually works. You probably need to be pretty drunk, but when you are, it's actually fun.So, as a one time entertainment, it's actually worth it."", 'By now, audiences should realize what they are in for when it comes to Jason Statham leading an action film. The Beekeeper is the latest film to continue his long-running legacy of action flicks and it\'s quite a bit of fun. It\'s very far from an awards nominee, but for a film I had zero expectations for, and for being as cheesy as it is, it\'s pretty good. Take that as you will because I will be diving into things that are also pretty bad as well. The cheesiness of this film will turn some people off, but I was able to ignore it. Here\'s why I recommend The Beekeeper if you want to watch a new action-packed film to enjoy and not have to think too much about.The ""Beekeepers"" is an organization of hitmen who take out criminals. Jason Statham plays Adam Clay, a retiree from this organization, who is on a manhunt for everyone involved in scamming a woman he cared for, which led to her suicide. It\'s as simple as that. There are multiple bosses in this company, so it\'s like watching a sophisticated video game being played out. The action sequences are well-choreographed and there are quite a few action scenes, so overall, this film was a blast to watch. With that said, the dialogue from beginning to end it pretty atrocious.If the script had been reworked, I think this could\'ve been a surprisingly great film as a whole. Sadly, the dialogue is full of Bee puns that fall flat almost every time, even with solid actors delivering them. The character arc and dialogue for Josh Hutcherson\'s Derek Danforth (who is the main villain of the film) is laughable, and not really in a good way. His whiny, self-entitled performance was great and I liked that he was giving this character his all, it\'s just that, again, the dialogue sucks. The lines everyone was saying took me out of the experience many times. Still, there is a lot of great action, and that\'s what I wanted from a movie like this anyway. I\'m sure the dialogue will have people hating this movie and I\'m equally sure certain people will find it hilarious. I\'m kind of in the middle.The Beekeeper is David Ayer\'s latest directorial effort and as always, he does a great job with action. His touch as a director is always welcomed by me and the neon look to the film was cool as well. It\'s a cool film to watch and it\'s aesthetically pleasing. I may be ripping apart the script, but it\'s just the dialogue. The story itself plays out nicely and has a nice resolution. I was looking for a fun action film and this film delivered that, despite its downfalls. I say check it out.', ""Jason Statham is at his best - both action and acting. But the agent Parkers character is so gross, it makes you puke - for the misfit actor, her BS acting and the BS script.The concept of a Beekeeper program is actually great, but other than action, most of the movie is not worth anything. So many forces getting involved in such an otherwise beautiful concept ruined everything. Had it been a simple revenge without involving every damn agency, without the yuck Parker, it would been a great movie.I just hope they make a sequel by keeping the character and the concept of the beekeeper only, just like Equalizer, and write the other parts better, I'd definitely love watching that."", 'Just when you think we have reached the bottom of filmmaking ... there is always something like this flick just to prove you can do a lot worse! It s so bland. The FBI agent was not professional and dressed and sounded dumb, lost mom by suicidal act and that did not play much of a roll after the incident,, the villains sounded stupid, especially the dip shots from the call centers. The story idea was great, Jason was awesome but the rest of the actors failed to bring it home. This movie is a terrible revenge story. The idea that Beekeepers are the most elite, well-trained, best equipped one man army is so over-used. The most unbelievable part is that he is hunted by mercenaries, law enforcement, and other Beekeepers. The acting is terrible, the storyline is worse.', 'David Ayer\'s ""The Beekeeper"" has Jason Statham going full John Wick and full Equalizer. This movie is 90 odd minutes of relentless, unhinged, pure escapist fun, with Statham doing what he does best - taking out bad guys like it\'s nothing and looking uber cool while doing it. He does that here in spades, in the most brutal and ridiculously entertaining ways. Yes, you need to throw believability aside, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action thrillers where it\'s one man against all, you will love this, just like I did. This movie really was a blast and a half, and then some. A great way to start 2024 movie season. I loved it. Pure escapist entertainment.', ""After Fast X and The Meg 2, I swore I wouldn't waste any more of my time on Jason Statham movies, but the trailer for The Beekeeper looked good, so I thought I would give him one last chance. I just hoped that I wouldn't get stung again.Thankfully, this action flick from director David Ayer is as sweet as honey: it's unpretentious, over-the-top, gloriously violent nonsense that isn't to be taken seriously... the film is all about how many people the star can kill or maim during the 1hr 45minute runtime (the answer: a lot!).Statham plays Adam Clay, a beekeeper in more ways than one: he looks after bee hives on the farm owned by kindly Eloise Parker (Phylicia Rashad), but he's also a retired special operative known as a 'beekeeper', part of a government programme so secret even the FBI doesn't know about it. When Eloise loses all of her savings to scammers and commits suicide, Adam isn't a happy man and goes after those responsible, the trail leading all the way to the President of the United States (Jemma Redgrave).Buildings are blown up, limbs are broken, body parts are severed, people are shot, but Adam barely gets a scratch -- those looking for realism should look elsewhere. There's even a scene where a female beekeeper uses a mini-gun mounted on the back of a truck, and mini-guns always equal fun.At the end of the day, Adam makes the bad guys pay for their crimes, and promptly escapes, presumably to set up some more bee hives (the villains having shot up his earlier ones) and to prepare for the inevitable sequel."", ""They forgot to write a script? Or bring their head along in this movie?Nothing seemed to work, acting, storyline, everything was so rushed. The actors were incredibly bad, especially Parker. That must be some of the most cringe, b acting I have ever seen. It was unwatchable, I stayed in the cinema because I had my little brother with me, and wouldn't be rude and interfere with the other people in the cinema.This movies gets -3/10Way too cheesy and cringe. David Ayer this is a redo, better luck next time. My sincere condolences for the people watching.Just another movie for the money, so sad."", 'The story revolves around a notorious secret agent codenamed ""The Beekeeper"" (Jason Statham) living a peaceful life. However, his past catches up with him when his close friend is murdered. Driven by revenge, Clay must take on the dangerous secret organization he once left behind and uncover a high-level conspiracy.The Beekeeper is a solid action experience that combines strengths and weaknesses worth considering. The action presented in the movie does steal the show, although some viewers may wish for more suspense and violence (gory/bloodier) than what is shown.In terms of plot, some viewers may feel that the main character Clay (played by Jason Statham) is often lucky. While this is common in action movies, some viewers may feel that it makes the storyline too predictable.But in the end, it still offers an enjoyable experience at the movies, being a good choice for those looking for entertainment without too much critical analysis.', 'Look,I love a good action flick as much as anyone, and Jason Statham is usually awesome. But sadly director David Ayer delivers what will probably be one of the worst movies of 2024. Ayer made one great movie over 20 years ago (Training Day) and also delivered a good flick in Fury, but everything else he makes is horrible. I will admit I did get a kick out of how dumb and goofy this movie is, and laughed a lot. Statham\'s character is like a cardboard box, it\'s so boring. Yes his fighting scenes are very cool but he\'s played awesome characters before that also had a bit of kick. In this movie he gives us nothing.Phylicia Rashad looks fabulous and gets about 5 minutes of screen time. Jeremy Irons and Josh Hutcherson do a great job but their talents are wasted in this movie.The plot starts out really promising...who wouldn\'t love to see a revenge action movie where the evil call centers get justice? But sadly the premise is wasted.Oh if you love hearing the word ""Beekeeper"" and references to bees you\'ll love this.The dialogue in this movie is so corny. It\'s almost like a satire of action movies at some points.In David Ayer\'s world, nothing works like it actually does in the real world. It is so goofy the way he portrays everything. And this is something he does in a lot of his movies. Just dumb fictional versions of everything from presidents to agencies to how classified programs work. But I do understand they have to make movies and sometimes make everything really stupid to be entertaining. But this movie takes the cake. For instance, call center scams are a real thing and there are many YouTube videos showing how they operate. But in this movie, the call center office is the most over the top clown spectacle you\'ll ever see and the actual scam is a ludicrous fictionalized version of how they actually work.The two main FBI agents are portrayed goofy AF and their dialogue is nearly unbearable.Statham\'s character, the beekeeper, doesn\'t want you to steal from old people but he has no qualms with murdering about 50 federal law enforcement officers in the course of the movie without batting an eye.So if you are about 13 years old this movie will be the coolest thing you\'ve seen but anywhere over that and it\'s just too dumb. Maybe when it\'s on streaming it might be fun to watch and make fun of on a rainy day.', ""I was going into this with little to no expectations. I was pleasantly surprised that everything in this movie was so satisfying. I felt 0 sympathy for any of the villains or scammers in this movie and it was euphoric to see them get their due reckoning. Of course Jason nails it and makes ever kill and brutal take down very satisfyingOne thing I will say is that the lore behind the Bee Keepers was interesting enough to keep my attention though corny with the hive talk at times it works as world building. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of action movies and likes satisfying conclusions."", ""The Beekeeper buzzes with intensity as it unveils a gripping tale of vengeance that transcends personal vendettas to impact an entire nation. The film takes you on a relentless journey with one man, a former operative of the enigmatic 'Beekeepers.' What begins as a brutal campaign for personal justice quickly escalates into a high-stakes thriller with national consequences. The storytelling is a masterclass maybe mediocre in suspense, weaving a web of intrigue and unveiling layers of a clandestine organization. The protagonist's journey from a solitary avenger to a player in a larger, more dangerous game is both compelling, almost average and chilling. The Beekeeper delivers not only on the promise of riveting action but also explores the shadowy realms of power and conspiracy, making it a must-watch for any fans of gripping thrillers with a touch of espionage intrigue. The 6/10 is appropriate."", ""I mean, I don't know what to say";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I had good expectations going off the trailer and they were met and beyond.The film starts off well and builds momentum for a decent revenge arc although it is hard to follow sometimes. The shakey camera work contributes to this as well as the dialogue not being particularly clear.However what takes this film from good to great is the final third. The music, the action, the violence, it was just so incredibly well done especially for first time director. I couldn't take my eyes off it and didn't know what to expect next.Thank you Jordan peele for saving this from streaming as this deserves to be seen on the big screen!"", 'I was really excited for this film because I think Dev Patel is such a great actor. The film started out very strong, and I was thoroughly engaged. Despite the pacing feeling rushed at times, it somehow worked for me as a viewer, providing all the necessary information to lay the groundwork for the story.However, the second half of the film was a disappointment. It felt like an afterthought and pulled me out of the story. The pacing slowed down in a strange way, making it feel out of place. It was like anticipating a great bridge in a song, only to be let down by a disappointing EDM drop from a Jennifer Lopez track from 2011.Regardless, I think this was a solid directorial debut for Dev Patel. He did a good job, and the action scenes were really engaging and impressive.', ""The movie is a techincal feat, its amazing how they managed to shoot the entire movie on a macro lens and without a gimbal. I know there were shakes but common its a handheld camera.I am from India and I didn't connect to it at all. It missed the essence! There is very little character development and the main characters are not memorable. We don't know about the people of the village except they loved to tell the same story over and over again and the kids loved it. We don't really know who is Alpha and whats their deal. We don't know the little kid who stole stuffs for the hero and why.Average at best!"", ""You can tell this was Dev Patel's first time directing because it feels like he refused to cut any scene from it in the interest of keeping the story engaging. The second hour of the movie could have been 20 minutes. There was no longer any plot, you knew exactly what was going to happen from the midpoint, you just didn't realize it was going to take over an hour of pensive looks and Dev punching 200 people. The best way I can describe it is if that scene from John Wick where he takes forever to get up the stairs and then he's right at the top and tumbles down? Imagine if that was half the movie. It could have been great if only it was properly edited."", 'A good revenge film that takes its time to develop the protagonist. Dev Patel gives a gut-wrenching portrait of man that lost everything. Enhanced by some creative photography, the violence is brutal and visceral. Taking its time, the film asks the audience to be patient for the hero to fully come into his ""powers,"" but the payoff is well worth it. There is some ""shaky cam,"" but not too much to ruin the experience. The spirituality, as well as the legends told in the movie, really add to the overall story, giving the film more substance than a lot of action films. The villains could of been developed a bit more, especially the Lion, but that\'s nitpicking.', 'As usual, I don\'t know where to start. It\'s a decent film overall. Seems well made for the most part, good cinematography, and the score was pretty good as well. It\'s not like it\'s boring or anything but this is quite a generic revenge corruption plot.

I used to only give it an 8.  Why the change?  Easy.  I watched the little things.Those of you who haven\'t seen it, stop reading now.  But for those of you who have...The first 8 of that ten comes from spectacular action sequences.  Anyone can see those.  What the other 2 points comes from is the subtle things that director George Miller slipped in there that you would only notice the second time you watch.Missed by almost everyone else\'s comments is that ""The Road Warrior"" is simply a locked room puzzle.  The good guys have the gas and want to escape from their compound to ""the coast.""  But if they try to leave, they will surely be killed by the savages waiting outside who only want their gas. Their solution is completely unexpected, yet when you watch it again, it is telegraphed the entire movie.For instance, when Pappagallo is giving an inspirational speech to the good guys about how ""that vehicle"" is going to haul their gas to the coast, the vehicle in the background is NOT the tanker, as it should be, but instead the school bus that eventually takes them, and the gas, to freedom.And what will the tanker be hauling?  Notice the day before the escape when Pappagallo talks about driving the tanker with Max.  He stares blankly into an hourglass, filled with SAND.  He already knows he\'s not coming back, as his diversionary tactic will surely get him killed.Anyone who claims ""The Road Warrior"" is merely a testosterone-laden guy flick should watch it again.  What it REALLY is is the tightest, smartest, pure-action movie ever made.  No moment is without significance.  No moment is wasted.  It is a testament that every post-apocalyptic movie is referred to as ""The-Road-Warrior-on-\'x\'.""  The next time you watch it, REALLY watch it.  You\'ll find there\'s more there than you ever thought there was before.', '""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" starts more or less where the first Mad Max movie ended. Since his wife and child were murdered by a gang of bikers he\'s completely on his own, driving trough the Australian desert. But one thing has changed: after an apocalyptic nuclear war, much hasn\'t been left of the country and the most precious good in the world is now petrol. Wars are being fought for it between gangs of strange bikers and people who try to survive and protect the precious fluid with their lives. When Max stumbles on a small group of honest people running a remote oil refinery, he helps them to escape and survive the gang attacks, but for a price...Personally I liked the second movie more than the first one. I guess that is because it dared to be more innovative and creative. If you watch the biker gang, the group of honest people, the entire world and environment in fact, then you\'ll notice that the creators have taken more of their time to make it all look a lot better than in the first movie. The main reason for that may well be that they had a much larger budget than with the first movie of course.Even though it is still the best to watch the movies in the correct order to fully understand what is going on, you can also watch them separately. They can be seen as movies on their own and when you do so, you\'ll still understand everything of the story. Anyway, this is a good action / Sci-Fi movie that had plenty of good things to offer. A good story, some nice acting, a lot of well developed action scenes... made it all look very good and professional. I enjoyed watching this movie and that\'s why I give it a 7/10, perhaps even a 7.5/10.', ""Mad Max 2 (or The Road Warrior, as it is frequently referred to) is a visually impressive, thinly plotted action movie that does what it sets out to do with a great deal of success. Let it be noted from the start this film isn't trying to be the twentieth century answer to Shakespeare. The objective here is to present high-octane action and stunts in the most eye-popping, visceral manner possible. Within the parameters of its own agenda, Mad Max 2 is a great film. If you come to the film seeking great depth, ongoing characterisation, clever dialogue and such like, you won't find what you're looking for. If you want to experience an exhilarating action film \x96 and, let's face it, we all need to watch films for entertainment every now and again \x96 then Mad Max 2 delivers by the tanker-load! Following the death of his wife and child, former Australian traffic cop Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) has become a scavenger who cruises the lawless roads of post-apocalypse Oz in search of fuel. Every time he finds an abandoned or crashed vehicle, he uses bowls, bottles and other such containers to bleed off whatever precious fuel may be left in it. The roads are riddled with similar scavengers, some of whom are even more violent and desperate than Max. Following a dramatic pursuit against a group that includes the fearsome, mohican-wearing Wez (Vernon Wells), Max befriends a man who pilots a primitive form of chopper, known simply as the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence). The Gyro Captain guides Max to a nearby oil depot in the middle of the desert, populated by a bunch of relatively law-abiding and fair-minded people. However, the depot is under constant threat from a gang of marauders who circle it day and night, taunting those inside with threats of violence and torture, and capturing the desperate few who occasionally try to drive away from the oil compound in a bid for freedom. Among this gang of sadists is Wez, but he is nothing compared to the gang leader \x96 a terrifying masked goliath known as the Humungus (Kjell Nilsson). Max manages to get into the oil depot, where he offers his assistance to the defenders within if they will give him some fuel in return.Mad Max 2 features a number of good points. The costumes are imaginative, the vehicles are intriguing, the setting looks appropriately bleak - while it is most definitely a low-budget film (admittedly, though, slightly more expensive-looking than Part One), the makers have come up with ingenious ways of concealing their limited funds. Performance-wise, the script doesn't ask much of the cast, although Gibson demonstrates a degree of charisma and Spence as the Gyro Captain turns in a weird but arresting acting job. Perhaps the most memorable performance comes from a young lad named Emil Minty, who plays the Feral Kid (a strange, animalistic boy who protects his people with a razor-sharp boomerang!) The stunt work is absolutely incredible, more so when one reflects that there are no fancy computer generated effects here, just a lot of meticulously prepared stunts and crashes performed by a team of extraordinarily brave stunt drivers. Also noteworthy is the intense music by Brian May. Mad Max 2 is violent, trashy, fast-paced fun \x96 a film that doesn't set itself ambitions above its station, and is all the better for it. Perhaps the best of the trilogy."", 'Well done stunts and camera shots, especially for it\'s time for sure. Mel Gibson once again stars as Max on another life-threatening adventure teaming up with a surviving colony versing more hooligans going after one of their most valuable resources. This of course is one of the main ""attractions"" when it comes to the Mad Max series, and is also the most popular out of the older trilogy. It was simply more aggressive with more dangerous enemies and had a more interesting and unique survival story compared to the original Mad Max. Fairly well produced, superb talented action, and a great smash ending.', 'Seriously, what happened to movies? Modern Hollywood sucks. This film is EPIC AF. Great world building. Awesome bad guys. Great hero.', ""The original imho is so much better. The first Mad Max is an futuristic tragedy/vengeance movie. This one is action packed desert/fur/spikes&horns movie - I guess I am just not a fan of all that... It's good, but imo not as good as the 1st one. I know the majority thinks different though. Sorry"", 'Apparently a big hit in Italy, considering the number of knock-offs and rip-offs that followed after its release, MAD MAX 2 is one of the grand daddies of the post-apocalypse genre, especially in a visual sense with the desert locations, bizarrely-dressed villains, tattered heroes, modified bikes and cars and raw action. This is a solid and well-paced little movie, my personal favourite of the MAD MAX trilogy, with better action than the first and not as silly as the third one. Although the budget isn\'t the highest, the film contains some phenomenal scenes of action and stunts, especially the finale which involves about a dozen assorted cars and bikes chasing an oil ranker through a 2000-mile desert. The bleak Australian desert conditions can\'t be bettered, and the thumping music - from Queen\'s Brian May, of all people - really gets the adrenaline pumping.At heart, this is still a pretty dark movie, with a large body count, brutal violence, and characters being killed off in scenes that you wouldn\'t see in a Hollywood movie. Most of the good guys end up being brutally killed and even Max hardly makes it out alive at the end, a battered and scarred victim. Mel Gibson essays the role of Max once more and makes the hard-edged loner with an honest heart his own, and with only a little dialogue he creates a strong screen presence that not many actors could so assuredly achieve. Being an Australian movie of the \'80s, there are plenty of weird and bizarre characters, the most-remembered of which is the Feral Kid, who uses a razor-sharp boomerang to cut of people\'s fingers and the like. The bad guys are dressed in outrageous costumes of chains and leather and led by the hilarious Humungus, a huge bald muscular bloke with a Jason mask.Vernon Wells (later to play the chief baddie in Arnie\'s COMMANDO) has a ball as Wez, a permanently psychotic biker with a mohawk who goes over the edge when his girlfriend is slaughtered by the Feral Kid, and his overacting is something to behold. Although the cast is comprised of unknowns, Bruce Spence really makes an impression as the ""Gyro Captain"", a desert mechanic/eccentric who flies a bizarre contraption and supplies some of the film\'s intermittent comic relief. The vehicle and costume design is imaginative, and combined with the locations gives the film a realistic look so that you really think that you\'re in a futuristic world. All this and more is topped off by the excellent car chases, which are truly pulse-pounding and some of the best put on screen. MAD MAX 2: an odd - and unique - masterpiece, as only the Australians could have made.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"[""I'll give this film credit for putting a fresh spin on the overdone revenge film. The action is very unique, while also evoking memories of the Wachowskis' work on The Matrix. I really enjoyed the Vangelis-esque score used throughout. It helped create that dark, futuristic atmosphere necessary for the story. Even if you think you see where the story is going, it manages to go in unexpected directions. Between the cool concept, great sets, and dark themes, Upgrade is just that, an upgrade to the typical revenge action thriller."", ""Through and through this movie felt like a longer episode of black mirror. The production was higher and the cinematography was really cool. I could see how the stabilization lock on his head during fight scenes could make some people dizzy, but I thought it was a unique way of doing things. Some of the acting was sub-par during the casual interactions, but I thought the plot and action made up for it. It's thought provoking in the way Black Mirror is and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys that content and doesn't mind gore."", ""This has seriously become my favorite AI movie to date. I can't believe it was low budget because it's impossible to tell apart from the unknown actors who all do an excellent job. I will do my best to replace its lack of marketing with recommeding it to everyone. I was expecting something entertaining and instead got an amazing plot with a mind-blowing ending. If you enjoy this genre, you can't let this one pass you by. What everyone says is true, it's like a long, perfectly executed Black Mirror episode. I rated it 10 stars for the simple reason that I could not fine anything wrong with it or anything I didn't like. From beginning to end, this movie is amazing. I cannot recommend it enough."", ""Upgrade is unfortunately in the club of great movies that completely flew under the radar when first released. But that might actually work to its advantage, as this is definitely one of those movies where the less you know going in, the better. The only reason I was aware of Upgrade is because of writer/director Leigh Whannell (Saw, Insidious), and the fact I'd heard plenty of great things from friends who'd seen it. The film takes the all-too-familiar premise of a man looking to avenge the murder of his wife, and puts an interesting new sci-fi spin on it. Whannell clearly loves the classics, because Upgrade's influences are easy to spot - RoboCop, Blade Runner, Dredd, Death Wish. They've all been thrown in a blender, and what comes out is something that feels like its own movie, while also paying tribute to everything that inspired Whannell to become a filmmaker in the first place. Upgrade is violent, thought-provoking, funny, surprising, with some terrific fight sequences, an awesome soundtrack, and a dynamite performance from Logan Marshall-Green. I also get the feeling I'm gonna love it even more the next time I watch it. Highly recommended for fans of sci-fi/action."", ""Probably worthy of a bigger production as it's a great science fiction story with comedy action and a few twists.One of those pleasant surprises that you don't expect in an unknown film, I've seen far worse more well known and promoted movies, worth a view."", 'This film is basically ""Robocop"" meets ""Death Wish"", with less satire than the former and more humor than the latter. And it\'s a B movie blast. An unrelenting pace, fantastic fight choreography that doesn\'t skimp on the gleeful blood and gore, and never not fun or interesting to look at. Yeah some of the one-liner dialogue as delivered by Logan Marshall-Green feels a bit forced and the plot isn\'t exactly clever or unique, but damn it, it all works and it makes it\'s own beautiful alchemy out of a bunch of borrowed parts. This is cheap genre filmmaking done right.', ""I admit to enjoying UPGRADE, a simple science fiction-oriented twist on the usual revenge storyline.

I didn\'t really sense much chemistry with her and Snow\'s characters, because it didn\'t seem like they even any notable spent time together, and her disappearance at the end, leaving the snake to attack him, felt so strange. Why did she waste time setting up a nasty trick like that, if it wasn\'t going to kill him, and serve just to slow her escape down, and also make him hate her? Was she just trying to make some kind of risky point? I don\'t know, it just didn\'t really make sense to me.And the singing... I can\'t say exactly what bothered me about it, but it just felt weird. I found the singing scenes long and kind of painful - I guess it didn\'t feel like someone in that setting sincerely singing, but someone from 2023 singing for a 2023 movie and pretending to add a folk kind of twang to it. She\'s a great singer, I\'m not denying that, but it didn\'t feel like it fit with the setting somehow.Overall, I guess the movie was somewhat interesting, though I wouldn\'t say ""enjoyable"". I wouldn\'t recommend it to friends, but maybe the book\'s pacing is better? I don\'t expect I\'ll be reading it though, unfortunately.', ""I came into this movie with low expectations hoping to have my socks knocked off. But they are still very much on. Ziegler's acting and accent was bad no other way to put it just plain bad. The story was hard to buy into. The chapters almost felt like loosely connected but widely under developed stories that to do properly could have each been a movie on their own. It's a very basic see it once and say you have seen it. Several parts of the movie felt like they wanted to be rated R but were dumbed down to make a pg13 movie I'd also give a parent warning my daughter wanted to see it which is why we went and it was VERY dark for PG13."", ""Funny people in the comments not expecting songs from a movie that starts with the name THE BALLAD OF.The whole point of the movie was to show how Snow starting rising to power and also how the Capitol started being manipulated into start liking and watching the games.It was a great adaptation, the most faithful one since Catching Fire. Rachel Zegler is a great singer and a great actress. The songs are very important to the story, every song contains an important part of the movie ESPECIALLY the one she sings laying down by the lake.People need to actually pay attention to what they're watching."", 'I understand that many people highlight how faithful they were to the books. That\'s brilliant but this is a movie made for the mass audiences now.First of all, there\'s way too much of singing, it gets cheesy and annoying. Secondly, they\'ve tried too hard to remind us our ""Katniss Everdeen"" it\'s does not feel natural. I don\'t like Rachel Ziegler\'s performance at all she is way too theatrical her accent is too comedic. They have tried to make her Katniss.There must be a Part II for this movie as well I suppose because it left many questions unanswered.

Special credit goes to Colin Farrell and his acting.We dont really get movies like this anymore. Movies these days are cheap money grabbers and superhero films. This is a whole different class of film', ""This is a typical Guy Ritchie film. Plenty of action, deaths, bad language and occasional laughs. Some of the scenes are Pulp Fiction-esque. There's not a lot new here, but the film moves along quite nicely. Not overly keen on the storytelling format of the film, and Hugh Grant goes on a bit too much. Matthew Mcconaughey is well cast, Colin Farrell steals the show and will probably win some awards for his performance. Some poor script writing at times, but overall well worth a watch."", 'At first I thought it started a little slowly but in hindsight it was just right.

It boils down to the law of diminishing returns - too much of anything and it will eventually lose its impact. This could be said about much of the dialogue and plot trajectory. The Gentleman is fun, it's flashy, it's amusing - it's Guy Richie. But it also feels like a rehashed pastiche of a bygone era. An era when he made crime movies that were genuinely funny and gripping.

While the movie starts with a good pace, it slows down significantly in the middle and degrades from there. The last 30 minutes feel like the ending of a 70s movie."", ""So if you are going into this, you have to know it's gonna be a little campy. Similar to The Kingsman, there are moments of heart, action, and absolute craziness.Some of the scenes were a bit much, but overall this was a fun, and Interesting movie. Some of the scenes were overly dramatic and we're similar to Deadpool's opening scenes as well.The twists in the story were definitely different, came one after another. All of the actors were on point, and I loved the switches from Argyle to Real life. The worst part was the CGI cat. And I don't think Samuel Jackson said MFer once. I was shocked."", ""Candy colored, over the top, action packed fun. This is not a serious movie, by any stretch of the imagination, but a fun, visually imaginative popcorn flick. The cast is solid and enjoyable and the plot is entertaining. I hope Apple holds fast and lets this become a franchise, because the world needs more post Barbie, Bond like romps. If you enjoy movies like Big Trouble in Little China, or the original Peter Sellers Casino Royale, this movie is up your alley. I'm always happy to see Sam Rockwell cut a rug on screen, and if they'd have given Samuel L. An f-bomb, it would've gotten another star from me."", ""I had a fun time watching this movie. Although my friend who accompanied me didn't like it, I found the imaginative plot quite engaging. The well-known actors' performances kept me glued to the screen, even during the cheesy scenes. While the movie may not be a contender for the Oscars, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world.The only downside for me was that the movie felt a bit too long for its storyline. The movie's marketing is quite effective, as the trailer seems to focus on Dua Lipa and Henry Cavill, but their appearances in the film are short. Despite this, both of them did a great job. However, it's important to note that they are not the main characters of the movie, as the trailer might suggest.All in all, I enjoyed the movie. If you're a fan of adventurous spy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, this one is definitely worth watching."", ""Wow- was this work reviewed by anyone? A generous 2, in fact, I am changing it to a 1. One of worst 3 movies I have ever had to sit through. Junior high-level script and layers upon layers of unimaginative fight scenes attempt to make this script entertaining. The book hero concept is NOT clever, is not well written and definitely does not come to life. Lured in with stars like fruit flies to their death in a movie filled with cider vinegar- movie goers have my sympathy. Several behind this must have gone into medium length comas as this script isn't fit to put a match to, it probably is too dull to ignite. Popcorn with an anesthetic or finding the wrong theater and noise-cancelling headphones wouldn't save this-"", ""When you hop on a rollercoaster you don't expect to reach any destination but just hold on and enjoy the experience. I don't know what the expectations were from the other reviewers before settling in to view it but mine was for some mindless entertainment, a smattering of comedy and some action.I always love to watch Sam Rockwell in action and Bryce Dallas Howard was a good foil for him - they actually had some chemistry. The concept did remind me a little of 'Romancing the Stone' (1984) but this storyline differs greatly.All in all it's a fun roller coaster ride with lots of unexpected twists and turns which fulfilled my expectations."", ""One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would have walked out if I hadn't paid for it which disappointed me because there were so many people in that I'm a fan off. I can't remember laughing one time during the entire movie. I didn't see the twists coming in the movie but even as good as those were, it was nowhere near enough to come close to saving this movie. I'm not a John Cena fan but he was not even close to being the worst part of this movie. There's a post credit scene that came on as I was walking out and I didn't even bother going back to watch it because there's no way I'm watching a sequel."", ""This is the most ridiculous movie I have ever seen. I love it.I am not allowed to leave a review that short so I'll just reiterate the above statement. After all, I am a person who likes to be concise and this minimum character rule seems to be a waste of your time and mine.The film sets up some interesting premises but don't get your hopes up too much with those. It's not going to tie together in some inception / tenet complex web of interweaving and complimentary plot lines. Quite the opposite. It is going to dazzle your inner child with absolute nonsense. Set yourself up for a bit of mindless fun."", 'The movie is mediocre for the best part. But the last 30-40 minutes are nightmare. I think that the scenario was written down in an addiction clinic after a dealer broke in. Honestly I would give it less then one star if possible. When you look at the cast you cannot suggest the mockery that is about to follow. Also the entire movie is filmed on a green screen and the CGI was so bad it would be a shame for any average youtuber. I thought that the computer effects really went a long way in the past years but with this is like they have used a technology from the 90ties. The only explanation would be that they blow most of the budget for the cast and only had 20 bucks for everything else. I will quote Jeremy Clarkson saying ""Top Gear Top Tip: AVOID!""']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The pace of the movie was good and does not feel slow. It has the difficult task of introducing so many characters but by the end you end up understanding pretty much everyone's motivation for finding the gold. The acting was matured and spot-on and does not feel very cartoonish. I would have liked the action to be a bit more innovative, but for now it will do. Anna Yamada does a good job in portraying her character, who is still a bit naive to the outside world. Kento Yamazaki plays the ruffian protagonist to perfection, but also does a great job in where he has to some emotional depth. Yuma Yamoto's portrayal of the slightly crazy Shiraishi is great, and I would love to see some more depth in his character development in the later parts. But I think Hiroshi Tamaki steals the show as the deranged officer Tokushiro Tsurumi. You can see the menace in his eyes and expressions."", 'Hope everyone stuck around after the credits for the cut scene. The scenery, costumes, and acting was on point.

It's got more imagination than five average postbomb flicks, incredible visual design, enough alternate societies with enough backstory apiece for three more movies (including an aboriginal clan who look like Peter Pan's Lost Boys and speak a dialect you'll be copying for days after you see it), car chases, amazing costumes, one of the most original death-duel sequences ever, Tina Turner, *and* Mel Gibson! I mean, goddamn, what more do you want? I personally want another movie just set in Bartertown AND a movie that follows what happens to Anna Goanna and her clan, and they don't even have to have Mel Gibson in them - that's how rich I think the imaginative depth of this movie is. I like it more every time I see it. Genuinely something special."", ""Now I do enjoy the MAD MAX films. They're the epitome of Australian cult filmmaking on a budget: filled with uniquely Aussie humour, outlandish characters and plenty of action. In fact, MAD MAX 2 is one of my favourite films ever, finishing with that massive, sprawling chase sequence that's still inspiring filmmakers today (Neil Marshall's DOOMSDAY, anyone?). For some reason, I'd never got around to watching this, the third in the series, although I had seen snippets of it on TV. I wasn't impressed by the scenes I saw: it seemed cheesier and sillier than what had come before, more child friendly. And the presence of Tina Turner seemed a definite distraction.When I saw MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME was showing on TV again, I decided to bite the bullet and sit down and watch it, fearing the worst. I didn't get that, but this is definitely the weakest MAD MAX film of the series. The heart and soul of the story is missing from this one. It seems like a tired repeat of the last movie, with an unwelcome American presence in the likes of Tina Turner and more Hollywood ideals. Much of the blame must lie on the troubled production: the producer died causing George Miller to back out and only direct the action sequences while another hand took over the character and dialogue moments. The result is a mixed production. The action scenes, of which there are only really two – the 'gladiator combat' scene in the Thunderdome, and the final chase – are exquisite, as good as that which has come before, and very entertaining. Not original, but still entertaining.The non-action scenes drag like heck. The colony of feral children are mostly irritating, with too many attempts to make them 'cute'. They actually reminded me of the Ewoks in RETURN OF THE JEDI. Gibson's character is underwritten in this one, so that he barely speaks and seems like a void at the centre of the film. There's no sense of his desperation or his primal nature here, he's just a stock hero character. I found Tina Turner to be pretty insipid as the would-be villainess, although I was happy to see Bruce Spence returning as the helicopter pilot, albeit he plays a different character this time around. I was also delighted by the casting of veteran dwarf actor Angelo Rossitto who bags something of a swan song performance late on in his career. So, the final result: a hit and miss effort, soon forgotten. The final chase scene, though, is worth watching, even if it is a case of revisiting past glories."", ""The first half of this film -- the part with Bartertown, Thunderdome, etc -- is brilliant, not just a repeat of THE ROAD WARRIOR but a totally new concept, thoroughly fleshed out. The second half, with the lost children, isn't as good -- and, more to the point, doesn't quite mesh with the first half, despite Miller's attempts to tie it all together at the end. Still, it's well above average in  a genre that has increasingly come to believe (wrongly) that special effects are more important than plot and character."", ""Sure it's probably the least good of the Mad Max films, but it is still entertaining as heck! It is maybe a little more Hollywood (which is a bad thing) than the first two. The music is overbearing at times, and some of the attempts at jokes were very cheap and American blockbusterish.\nOne of the main faults that has to be sited with this one is that the last thirty minutes or so are basically taken straight from The Road  Warrior. The car chase and then the speech about how a stranger helped them establish a new society were taken right out of the 2nd installment.It still is very creative, and the action has a wonderful momentum. I love the whole society that finds Max in the desert. I loved the recitation of their foundation, and I loved their dialect. I loved Masterblaster. And Tina Turner was actually cool, too. 8/10"", 'Why why why did someone think it was a good idea to fill Max Max 3 with a bunch of annoying kids?\nIts like half way through the movie the crew was switched and they thought they were making Oliver!Such a horrible way to end a most amazing trilogy.Max goes from road warrior to babysitter.Still any Max is better than no Max.', ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is set in a post apocalyptic Australia where a man named Max (Mel Gibson) is traveling through the vast desert, Max is attacked & his camels & wagon's full of his stuff are stolen. Max makes his way to a settlement known as Barter Town looking for his stolen goods, there he causes trouble & Barter Town ruler Auntie Entity (Tina Turner) is impressed with his fighting skills. Auntie Entiry offers Maxa deal, kill a man & he goes free with his possessions returned to which Max agrees. After his opponent is defeated in the Thunderdome arena Max is banished & left to die in the desert but is found by a tribe of children living in a valley who think Max is their saviour...This Australian American co-production was directed by George Miller & George Ogilvie, not many films have two credited director's but it is generally thought that Miller handled the action side of things while Ogilvie handled the drama & people moments. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is a very different type of film that came before, the original mad Max (1979) was a violent revenge drama with some brutal action scenes while Mad Max 2 (1981) is surely one of the best action films of the decade with some stunning stunts & inspired the whole post apocalyptic action film genre while Mad max Beyond Thunderdome is widely regarded as toning the action & violence down to appeal to a more mainstream audience & it's hard to disagree as everything that made the original two mad Max films so special has been watered down. The first third of the film is set in Barter Town & is reasonably good as far as post apocalyptic action films go but then it changes direction & a tribe of children are introduced that Max feels compelled to protect as they help him regain a bit of humanity, these kids are a bit annoying actually especially with their broken English mixed-up dialogue that does get irritating quite quickly & their silly myth about an airplane pilot that they go into great detail about (lucky us...). At well over 100 minutes it does drag at times & while it's watchable it feels predictable & the action scenes can't really compare to those in Mad Max 2.Again there's the whole end of humanity post apocalyptic look, while in the other two Mad Max films it looked quite real here the production design is very elaborate & a bit showy. The final chase revolves around a train & various bad guy's chasing it, it's OK but not as exciting or dramatic as the chases in the other Mad Max films. The violence is tamer here, in fact apart from a few fights there isn't any. Just as the end credits start it says on screen 'For Byron' which is a reference to producer Byron Kennedy who was killed in a helicopter crash while scouting for locations for the film in 1983.The film looks good if a little staged, the stunts & action are good but nothing spectacular & that just about sums up the whole film, good but not spectacular. Filmed around New South Wales in Australia. The acting is alright, I didn't like the little dwarf Angelo Rossito as you can barely understand what he's saying while pop star Tina Turner doesn't really do anything other than deliver a few lines.Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome isn't a terrible film by any means, it's not exactly great but it's watchable. It's just that the first two & Mad Max 2 in particular as so good that this watered down vision of Max was always going to disappoint. A Rumours of a fourth Mad Max have persisted over the years but I doubt it will ever happen."", ""This is one of the best teaching instruments for comparative government ever made--and a great action film as well! After studying comparative ideology and systems, have students watch and compare the communities of Bartertown and the Crack in the Earth--they love it!and they learn from it!Trust me, I've been using it for 10 years now and it never ceases to amaze me the genuine academic and intellectual discussion you can get a class to have concerning Max' adventures!  It's even better than Gulliver's travels!"", ""True, we don't need another hero, but if we're going to have one it might as well be Mel Gibson back in his prime.This is the often panned third part in the Mad Max series. Its flaws are pretty glaring and unfortunately obvious. Most glaring of all is that the film starts off with good promise but kind of falls apart in the second half when Max finds the kids. Even so I still like this film for what it achieves. It shows how the world has evolved since Part 2 (Road Warrior) and what the future could hold. While definitely a step down from its predecessor I found Beyond Thunderdome to be a still enjoyable part of the franchise."", ""Whether you've seen Fury Road and are back peddling to the beginning of the series to see the original three films, or you're a complete newcomer altogether, I would say skip this one, for now that is. If you're expecting the very Aussie, low budget, cult, gritty, zany, over-the-top, exploitation-esque tone of the other installments of the series, you will be surely disappointed just as I was upon first viewing."", 'Mel Gibson put his heart and soul into this film and I admire his great acting abilities as the role of Mad Max along with Tina Turner. However, this is just a story about Mad Max going into a desert and giving children of the desert a new life with happiness. This particular film was a big disappointment to me and I could have found a better way of spending my time than looking at a film that failed to live up to other Mad Max films. I am sure there was plenty of money spent in making this film, but it certainly does not measure up to the other Mel Gibson films. Love all kinds of films but this particular film was nothing I expected and I am glad it was produced and can be forgotten completely about.', '*SPOILERS* The third movie in the trilogy Mad Max franchise and the weakest Mad Max film I ever saw. This movie is stupid! I never understood why this movie is so bad. Even the first Mad Max is better than Beyond Thunderdome. Why such a praise for this film? The only good thing in this film is Mel Gibson and Tina Turner and her songs but that\'s it. The rest of the film everything sucks so bad in here and it is rated PG-13 and everything in this film is just wrong. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is awesome and the best of the trilogy, this film just isn\'t. But it is a real let down and a true disappointment for a fan like me. Max without his car V8 is nothing but a peace of low life.I know a lot of people love this film and I respect that some people even think this is better then the original Mad Max, Really? What is so good about this movie? Huh. This movie is boring, less violent it is PG-13 movie and Mel Gibson is at worst at his performance. This movie was a failure to me.Every time I watch it I just feel miserable oh and Mad Max the original film is way better flick then this one it really is.I apologize to all fans but in my opinion not yours this movie is the weakest one in the Mad Max franchise and if they would focus more on Bardertown and Thunderdome and got rid of the kids and make this movie rated R this could have been a great movie but right now in my opinion its a ""bad"" movie .This movie felt too rushed and it felt it just wasn\'t right.And also why this film is in the sand why the are no roads here? Why this is not a wasteland? Gosh I hate this film sue me! I also reviewed 2 years ago the first three Mad Max films and I didn\'t want to disrespect Mad Max franchise and I didn\'t want to get the hate on here.Mostly it was George Miller\'s fault when his friend and Producer Byron Kennedy died in a helicopter crash. He didn\'t care he made it less violent less apocalyptic and less action I really don\'t understand why people love this movie but the first one they don\'t? I don\'t know.We never found out more about Max or his fate the movie does not tell us anything.Shame on you, George this movie destroyed the Mad Max trilogy I am glad that Mad Max: Fury Road come out 20 years later and yes it is MILES way better action film then this one and I have reviewed all of them.Also I like Mel Gibson as a actor I always did I never said I hate him he is a really good actor and the Mad Max Trilogy alongside with Lethal Weapon franchise those movies made him in to a star that he is today so yea.Sadly the film is failure to me just my opinion.Tina Turner wasn\'t that terrible because she made two songs for this film and she performed her self. Songs: One of the Living and We Don\'t Need Another Hero a great songs and I love to listening them. Tina Turner also at acting isn\'t that terrible. But this film is horrendous awful and it sucks I hate those kids. This Mad Max has no weapons by him self, he has no car and Max doesn\'t kill anybody in this film.It feels to me like this Max is a pussy and he is afraid to kill people. I also have this movie on Blu-ray disc in my collection even tough is a boring stupid awful time waster I still have it in my video collection. I don\'t like this film I don\'t. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 action film in this franchise which is the best one, second best one to me is Mad Max: Fury Road I love those two films to death they are great films. Mad Max the first one is a good action film but it has problems but is at least better action film then Thunderdome that is my opinion. 2/10', 'Every time I\'ve seen this movie I get the same impression: some parts of it are so amazingly stupid/bad that they crack me up, they aren\'t intentional, and there are a lot of them";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It's very hard to make a successful sequel to an older classic movie, but I was immediately entertained from beginning to end. I won't give any spoilers, but I'll list my biggest takeaways from the movie.1. The flying scenes were incredible and had me on the edge of my seat.2. Tom cruise and miles teller were awesome.3. I want to quit my job and become a fighter pilot now.This movie is definitely worth paying for imax tickets and I suggest you get a big water bottle cause you will be sweating profusely as Maverick cuts through the sky like butter."", ""This is one of the best theatrical experiences I've had and I'm so happy someone has taken the practical route rather than throwing everyone into a green screen. I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience. Not some cropped cgi scenes."", ""If you were a late teen or in your early twenties in the mid 1980's the world was very different. No computers, no mobile phones, no internet, no DVD's. We had cars though, and bikes, and we loved them, and we loved films too. The original Top Gun captured this moment in time perfectly, and gave us a thrilling ride like we had never seen before. The humour, the games, the bikes, the aircraft and my word, those flying scenes. We went back to the cinema to see it again and again, and spent the following decades quoting the movie. As time went on, it remained like a static snapshot in time to perfectly represent that magical point in our lives for so many of us.Now, 36 years later, we are a generation that has lost our parents, we've had our own children who have moved on themselves, and we now approach the end of our own careers and our young selves are gone forever.This film is the missing bookend to that whole generation. The original was there for the start of our young adult lives, and this new film now marks the end. It's magnificent.I'm 55, but yesterday, just for one last night, I was 19 again. Thank you."", ""I was reluctantly dragged into the theater, thinking that they didn't need to make a Top Gun 2 and that the first one was where that story needed to end.I could write a couple paragraphs to summarize my feelings after walking out of the theater, but I'm going to leave it with just one sentence.I was wrong."", ""Wow. The first Top Gun is a classic, and as we all know, sequels/remakes rarely beat the original, especially 36 years later e.g. The Matrix Resurrections. Well, this film just broke that theory.Aside from the adrenaline-pumping edge or your seat action, this story also had heart. It successfully overachieves, and surpasses its predecessor on every level.The directing by novice Joseph Kosinski was outstanding, especially considering this was his fourth ever full length feature film. All the stunts, visuals and V/SFX were breathtaking, and the camera work perfection, that you'll feel you're in the cockpit of the jet. The soundtrack and score was amazing. The 131 min runtime literally flew by with its spot-on pacing. I actually wanted to see more. Casting and performances by all were also perfection, and once again Tom Cruise reminds us why he is still one of the top actors in the industry.There's nothing I can critique or wish was better, as this gem was perfect in every way. Absolutely stunning, action-packed with a compelling and emotional story, as well as being a visual masterpiece. And the fact the dog fights were real and not CGI (actors had to train to fly the jets), just makes this film that much more magnificent. I'll be definitely seeing this again and adding the DVD to my collection. It's a rare perfect 10/10 must see from me."", ""If there's any movie that deserves to be seen in the theaters with big screens and booming speakers. It's :Top Gun Maverick.One of my best experiences in years!"", 'This is one sequel that looked like it would never get made. It was stuck in development ""hell"" for years and years. Then it was delayed by COVID and other issues. Its almost as if we were not meant to see a sequel to Top Gun. But now it is here and the question is, was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding yes. This is the only sequel I have ever seen that i liked BETTER then the original. EVERYTHING about this film rocks! Tom Cruise is sixty this year but he can still do the job! He is awesome as Maverick capturing emotions and giving a performance that he hasn\'t given since A Few Good Men. You see Maverick\'s innate cockiness (something all fighter pilots have I\'m sure) but you also see his vulnerability and his pain especially the scenes where he talks about his dead wingman\'s son and how he can\'t bear the thought of him dying as well. Jennifer Connally and Miles Teller give great performances as well playing Maverick\'s love interest and Goose\'s son. Yes you 1980\'s music lovers we get to hear Kenny Loggin\'s Danger Zone at the beginning it is wonderful nostalgia. Oh and I should also mention the aieral sequences are the best and most intense in movie history you are on the edge of your seat the whole time. To wrap it all up I wanted to mention the touching scene where Maverick goes to see his old Top Gun classmate ""Iceman"" who is now an Admiral and dying of throat cancer. Val Kilmer looks so bad because he has had throat cancer and can no longer speak well. The scene is so sad but they have a joke at the end where he asks Maverick who the best pilot is? Go see this movie by all means!', 'There are so many references to the original that I was brought to childhood when I had first seen it.The best cinematic experience of my life and a perfect gift to all Top Gun fans.', 'Ariel sequences were great, but the lazy plot and story could have been so much better.I think the problem is that Maverick was a 2D character, and one of those dimensions hung on being young, cheeky and good-looking.

Set and costume design. In one word, sumptuous. From the neo baroque Emperor\'s palace to the Fremen Stillgar\'s sietch to the\'metropolis-tic\' Harkonnen home-world of Giedi Prime.The costumes were indulgently impressive eg the fetishistic leather of the Harkonnens, the bizarre plastic outfits of the Emperor\'s Sardukar, the Elizabethan gowns of the Princess Irulan. Great efforts were made to make the various environments well worn and dirty and much of the technology appears anachronistic... of \'technology as archeology\', which all fits perfectly within the Frank Herbert vision.Characters. For some reason most popular Sci-Fi movies involve characters that have little to define them from people of today, apart from latex masks and clothing. Under David Lynch\'s direction the peoples of the Dune worlds are human enough to relate to and \'alien\' enough to cause wonder. And lets not forget the Stage Three Guild Navigator ... this was the most original conceptions of a character as you are likely ever to see. Scenes like this give you the courage to sit through the more unpleasant aspects of the movie. The customs of the Fremen as defined by Frank Herbert are for the most part faithfully rendered although being a serial Dune reader, I would have liked the movie to linger more on these aspects of the Dune world.Acting. For the most part good. David Lynch directing his favorites Jack Nance, Kyle MacLachlan and Everet McGill cant really go wrong.I particularly liked Linda Hunt hamming it up as Shadout Mapes ...""the housssse keeeper..."" Dean Stockwell whilst an accomplished actor appeared a little wooden, but is not a problem really when compared to the ridiculous overacting of Jose Ferrer. What on earth was he thinking? And of course there was Kenneth McMillan. The Baron could have been no one else.But ...I am a huge David Lynch fan ... but .... what happened? His efforts to make the vast worlds and concepts of Dune more edible for mainstream audiences while necessary, did not properly respect the source material.In an effort to avoid the complexities of describing the \'weirding way\' (properly termed \'prana - bindu\' a kind of super martial art form) we are left with ... weirding modules ??!!!? ... what the hell? And to keep them in that poorly locked cupboard in the training room downstairs was just asking for trouble.And after all that spiel about crushing your enemy\'s nerves, exploding their organs, boiling their bottoms etc ... the Fremen simply go about making those silly sounds which cause little fire-pots to go off in the sand, the Emperors \'terror troops\' obligingly falling over.It\'s easy to be dismissive when speaking from a time that brought us action and fight sequences like those in the Matrix or LOTR. However I felt that the scale was far to small to be convincing (this was the fight for the fate of the known universe\'s economic prosperity!) Individual fight scenes were obvious and telegraphed and slow and just plain boring. The final showdown between Paul, the universe\'s super being (actually he\'s not but thats another story)and Feyd Rautha, was one of Cinema\'s greatest anti-climaxes.I mean he\'s the leader of a race of people whose woman and children routinely best the Sardukar and has unimaginable mind powers (all the powers of the Bene Gesserit and more)and still he is almost defeated by the Baron\'s nephew after a bit of taunting about his girlfriend.Another incomprehensible departure from the novel was the addition of \'heart plugs\'. Apart from the constant fear of getting it caught on something you\'d really have to wonder why the Baron chose to have one himself. That\'s just silly and as it turned out fatal.A lot of the psychedelic special effects were pretty crappy even for 1984. What\'s with the folding space scene which is simply done by the Guild navigator spitting the departure and destination planets out of his mouth and then ... wait for it ... flying between them? Of course scenes like the sand-worm swallowing the spice harvester still cause wonder ... it\'s more that the conception of those less tangible aspects like folding space or the Sayadina taking the water of life etc really did not convince me even way back in 1984.I also could not believe that Lynch succumbed to the temptation of tying the whole thing up with a rain storm. In one fell swoop he undermines the logic of the entire film. The collecting of water in thousands of Sietches across Dune was meant to be part of a trans generational plan to terraform the planet. It\'s meant to be science - the movie simply has it happen by magic (""for he is the Kwisatz Haderach""). Given that water is poisonous to the Sandworms and that Spice is produced as part of their life cycle, Paul really is not being much of a help. His Jihad is set to destroy the Universe.This Movie if produced today under the right direction (and a totally new screenplay) could be the most amazing thing. If it were possible to create a hybrid director (although I would avoid contracting the Bene Gesserit for the breeding program) of David Linch(for his quirky, darkly comic interpretation) and dare I say Peter Jackson (for his sincere respect for the source material, attention to detail and childlike wonder that he evokes as he lingers over landscapes, people and customs), it would do the justice to Frank Herbert\'s vision which has as yet (wether by movie, extended DVD or mini-series)remained unfulfilled.6 1/2 out of 10 , really.', ""Dune is very interesting, if not downright odd. However, the lore/universe has an alluring charm. Unfortunately, they don't do a good job of explaining the intricate political backstory of the movie. Another major problem is the pacing of the story, it's so too rushed. They made the mistake of trying to cram 2-3 movies worth of storytelling and lore into one 2 hours and 17 minutes movie. The production value (camera angles, special effects sets, costumes, etc.) is generally good for the time period. Some of the costumes are unintentionally comical and weird but that is what gives this movie its charm. Generally the acting wasn't great, besides the main protagonists. Over all it is an interesting tale that unfortunately fell short."", 'I saw this film in 1984. I watched it on TV a couple of weeks ago. In 1984 I thought the movie was bad. The story made no sense, the acting looked like a high school play and the score was to the ears what a visit to the dentist is to the mouth.After watching this epic on television in the year 2000 I have reevaluated my opinion of it.  It is actually dumber, duller and a bigger waste of time than I had previously thought.Still awful, after all these years.', ""For a movie from the 80's it has very good special effects.The script of this movie can be confusing and heavy for some people but for me it results in a complex story full of emotions, I love how it handles the story so fast, the special effects are good, it has good photography and it has good acting. The reason for some things that happen is not explained, there is no plot to follow and some things are not resolved.For me it works well and although it can start with a slow pace, then the pace of the film is much more dynamic, it is a very good science fiction film with some negative things but it is still enjoyable."", ""A Duke's son leads desert warriors against the galactic emperor and his father's evil nemesis when they assassinate his father and free their desert world from the emperor's rule.The general consensus is that this is not a good movie. But the general consensus is apparently wrong, because it has a decent rating on IMDb. And, in fact, it is a very enjoyable film and a great adaptation of the novel. On top of that, Lynch was great with his casting choices. Brad Dourif? Perfect! And even Sting.The version I watched ran just over two hours. Another version runs longer than three hours. Whether this would be even better or be too much is not known to me. I would certainly be interested in checking that version out."", 'I should have known, and actually did expect that the movie, at a little over three hours, couldn\'t do justice to the Frank Herbert novel that ran nearly eight hundred pages. This was one of those rare occasions where I recently read the book and called up the movie within a short period of time so that a reasonable comparison could be made. Yes, there were many elements of the novel that appeared in the film, though nearly as many elements that weren\'t, and merely thrown in to fascinate the viewer. One such was the appearance of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan), portrayed as a floating gas-bag with a face pock-marked with pus filled pimples that made him look grotesque. Or the Mentats, described here as human computers, whereas they were more effectively characterized in the novel as elite assassins. Characters in the novel like Lady Jessica (Francesca Annis) had a much larger role in the story that took place, and were much more influential in the mystical development of Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan) as the youth who eventually replaced his father to lead the Fremens against the Harkonnens on the planet Arrakis.So it puzzles me to learn that Frank Herbert was actually fond of the David Lynch treatment of his celebrated work, hailed by many as the ultimate work of fantasy fiction. For some, maybe so, but for me it doesn\'t hold a candle to Tolkien\'s Lord of the Rings trilogy, and if you extend that argument to cinema, the same holds true. Perhaps the best thing I can say about the movie was it\'s casting of principal characters. Kyle MacLachlan was a good choice for the role of Paul Atreides, maybe a tad too old to portray a fifteen year old future monarch, but I don\'t think an actual teenager would have been right to pull off the part. Jose Ferrer imparted the proper gravitas for the Padishah Emperor, and Jürgen Prochnow made for a suitable Duke Leto Atreides. One of the miscasts though had to be Patrick Stewart as Paul\'s adviser Gurney Halleck, mostly because he didn\'t have all that much to do and had no impact on the story. There were any number of scenes in which he was left just standing around as part of the scenery.On adapting such a well known and admired book as ""Dune"", director David Lynch has been quoted as saying, ""You\'ve got to be either stupid or crazy to try something like this."" With all due respect to someone who\'s had his share of success in filmdom, a remark like that makes one too easy of a target.', ""Yes, I've read the novels and, yes, they might crown a short list of world building sci fi masterpieces. What this movie, which I've seen multiple times, succeeds in doing, is manifest the spirit of this incredibly thought out universe. It also succeeds in other respects, but I'll leave that aside.It is interesting that the latest version, not a bad film at all, is almost a storyboard replica of the first. But all it adds is a bit of computer polish, and lacks the eerie ambiance that was so poignantly enhanced by the first's soundtrack.Folks love hating on this. Folks be folks. Thank you, Mr Lynch."", 'I first saw this in the late 80s n found it to be a confusing mess cos of not having read the books but still found it action packed.Revisited it recently after hating the new version cos of its boredom n lack of action.Well, none of em is closer to the books (having read the books now) but this older version shud be applauded for being a bit entertaining n having a big star cast for those days.Was a bit disappointed to see the hottie Virginia Madsen in a tiny role.', 'Frank Herbert put on a good face and said he was pleased, but you could see the truth and the suffering in his eyes. He died shortly after release, probably to escape the horror.  This movie sets special effects back by about a century or so, is a monument to bad acting and bad direction, and redefines ""hopelessly muddled plotlines."" Sad, because it\'s such a great book.  If you\'ve read the book you can barely figure out that it\'s supposed to be the same story.  If you haven\'t read the book, you won\'t be able to understand even one thing that\'s going on.  The sandworms are a joke, the stillsuit design completely ignores their purpose, the ornithopters are stupid, the space ships look like some kid playing with his mom\'s dishes, and the blue eyeballs look exactly like what they are-- some guy with an airbrush going over the movie frame by frame to try to convince you that these people really do have blue eyeballs.  Not to mention that the musical score is a travesty.  Can you tell?-- I hate this movie.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It has created a heroin that has to use her wits and smarts to win and conquer her setbacks. In a good way there are cringe lines and\nmoments. But. For the most part. It's good writing and it serves the story. I know we have been fooled once too many times. But. This is not one of those. The acting is good for what the story needs.

It's an interesting take on a military action movie where the drone operator (Crowe) can be the difference between life and death for an American team behind enemy lines. Of course some Hollywood magic carries the movie through scenes that wouldn't otherwise happen in real life but that's to be expected.Crowe does a great job as an aging drone operator who should be higher in rank by now but is held back by his own stubbornness. Without Crowe in this role I think the movie would fall far under the radar (pun intended) of most people looking for a decent action movie to watch. Hemsworth does a decent job in his role but it's Crowe that holds the film together. Worth a watch."", 'This movie is a kind of a blast from the past, when action movies like ""Commando"" or ""Missing in Action"" ruled the VHS rental stores. It has absolutely everything that fans of adult cinema appreciate and value - shootouts, swear words in the dialogues, simple motivations and quite good execution.Liam Hemsworth may not be the king of acting, but he delivers a sufficiently interesting role to follow his fate with excitement on face. For me, it was a pleasant screening, although it lacks some clear and positive argument. It is a solid action movie in a modern edition, but without unnecessary corporate influences. It is worth watching, because such productions are basically not produced today.', 'Not as bad as I feared. There is absolutely no nitty-gritty feel to it. Nothing dark or foreboding. Nothing really suspenseful. No, it floats gently on the surface, fairly nice, controlled and polished. But on the other hand it is mostly fairly realistic and surprisingly gory. The enemies cannot aim if their lives depended on it (which it actually does, making it even more surprising that they cannot aim) and hand grenades has huge explosions, tearing down walls and stuff. But overall fairly realistic, still.So yeah, I would give it a 6.5. Absolutely not a 7 and since 6.5 does not exist I am forced to give it a 6.', ""Straight forward action from start till finish, in a story about an inexperienced soldier (Liam Hemsworth) who has to rescue someone in a foreign enemy country, while Russel Crowe is guiding him through this enemy territory via drone cameras above, firing some missiles now and then, killing some bad guys.The bad: this story has got some incredibly silly plot turns, so it cant be taken seriously. For example: a drone command centre cant be reached because the phone is off the hook, because the guys on duty are having a break and watching football and eating pizza. What the what?!!The good: the action is okay. It's fast. It's big. It's loud. And it's reasonably realistic, with some nice explosions and lots of chases and attacks and even a few knife fights. It'll do for anyone into straight forward action movies.What's kinda special about this movie is that they tried (and only partly succeeded) in making the leading actors look human, by letting them chitchat about all sorts of little things, like their favorite (vegan) food or candy and more of that sort of dribble. These supposedly witty dialogues do feel too artificially constructed and do not ring true to life...Nothing extraordinary, but still enjoyable as a solid action spectacle, despite a few incredibly annoying credibility flaws."", ""Good movie.

Honestly, it is. It has been a beautiful week. Actually, it has been more than beautiful. The first snow has slowly covered our trees, the cool winterair has boldly taken over the days and nights in Norway. Beautiful. Well, actually, it has been more than beautiful. But what is `more than beautiful\'? Today it was the point where a touch of evil was added to the beautiful. And with the evil and the beautiful comes. well, you know where I am getting at. A thrilling adventure, ancientic tale-greatness, monstrous experiences and totally - with no doubts whatsoever - the one film to rule them all. And in MY MIND, bind me. to this film, this book, forever. From heart of someone who has not read the book, nor have any interest in Tolkien, but loves cinema more than anything in the world. this is one of my, if not THE, all-time cinematic moments.Norway is a small country. And for the small country - only one press screening of FOTR. A small bit about me. I love film, and work as a filmjournalist here in Oslo. Therefore I attended this press-screening. My relation to LOTR is quite simple. Have not read the book, but have been covering the developments of the films. And by that, I have grown a huge interest for the project. Enough now. I HAD AN URGE TO REVIEW THIS MOVIE. Because it is beyond anything I could expect, want, crave, imagine, desire, feel, anticipate. This is unimaginable. And when you see it. I found myself crying of nothing but admiration 2 minutes into the prologue (shiveringly spoken by Blanchett). It shows this dark lord, Sauron, and tells a the fascinating story of The One Ring. Now, excuse me for not being OBSESSIVELY AWARE of everything about this movie (or these books) before seeing or writing this. The prologue is nothing but a amazing sequence. Instead of going into each and every picture (frame) of this film (because I could, and there would be a lot to gaze at and analyse in every single one of them), I will say this: THERE IS SO MUCH. I was completely paralysed. I love every detail I could observe, from the complex battlescenes to the single face of mister Frodo Baggins bedazzling every single audience member. It was a fantastic experience. This review, as I can see, will turn into a not-cronologic piece, but forgive me - my thoughts are a bit hard to recollect. My mind is occupied with images that have burned hard to my iris, performances that I already love and quote. I walked out of the theater 7 hours ago.I have not read the books, as you can see. Now I have seen the first film, and a big bouldering voice tells me that I might have had this very experience many years earlier, by way of the book. But people, and I feel this is important to say, I\'ve just read the book. I think. A 3 hour movie - it felt like reading a book. Because the film felt so massive, it has layers upon layers - in character, in dialogue, in scenery (oh, my lord, the set pieces. I have fallen in love with Lothlorien, the Shire. Can I go to these places for vacation? Will I ever have enough money to go to New Zealand? This is so bloody fantastic in this film. It is so fantastic! I run out of words (especially in my English :-). We must go on!There has been a few hours as I said to dwell on this movie now, buit it\'s coming to me. It\'s coming to me as a grandiose wave of river-water lifted by the spellbinding of Arwen (Liv Tyler looks so stylish, such a timeless beauty. Eventhough (some stupid, boneheaded) people are going to scream ARMAGEDDON when they see her the first time, they will be silent when this elf is riding away from the black riders - bravely coming the halfling to rescue.) to eliminate ringwraiths(?). IT IS SO VERY, VERY GOOD. (Oh, I love this film. I have to see it again. I need my mother to see this film, I need to pick up a total stranger on the street, offer her a ticket just to see her face when she\'s leaving the theatre. I may have given her a lifetime of. well, an experience for a lifetime. Do you hear that Peter Jackson? You may very well, with this masterpiece (I have been dying to call it that), been responsible for thousands of people suffering through this year.) I NEED TO SEE TWO TOWERS NOW!!!! WHAT AM I GOING TO DO!!?? READ THE BOOK? I have to know whats happens. That thing happening to Gandalf. I can\'t believe it. He must return. Tell me he returns. Ian McKellen is superior. He is great. He acts like if. well, I couldn\'t see him act. There is Gandalf in him. For sure. Well, anyway, I am off track.FOTR is very big. A big tale. But very small. I mean, big it is, but small is he - Frodo. Oh my gracious lord of modern cinema, the very man who gave Mr. And Mrs. The liberty to create the god given actor named Elijah. Nothing crazy about these sentences, but it is a holy great performance. He is feeling. He is a feeling. My back was cold throughout the entire movie. Feeling Frodo, being Frodo, hurting Frodo, bearing with Frodo. A class-act, truly enchanting, spectacular, it-is-no-good-words-to-compliment-enough Frodo. I am, as you just read, trying to verbalize my experience of Frodo Baggins. But this turns away from reviewing. You want to read about the content of the film. What I saw. Because most of you probably know the whole story, and all the characters. Well, let\'s go to what there is to see.\nI saw the Shrine. It is a very richly realistic built, sunny, green place. I loved it. But no surprises. The home of Bilbo, cornfields. and then the city of Bir? Bie? Forgot the name. All the way, amazing scenery. The fact that there is a big difference in height among the characters, but not among the actors, well that is, how do I put it, flawless. Don\'t know how they could pull it off, but I am impressed. As I said before, this is so throughoutly worked on and polished - every picture and frame has something more than what you see, and every character blows my mind. What can I say? I\'m never this singlemindledly positive about a film, but this may very well be THAT ONE where everything seems to strike my mind and in, again, the cinematic darkness bind me. Every generation has a movie. Every saga has a. hehe, enough filmrelated quotings. Don\'t have to say much about this, but so that you know it: Howard Shore\'s score is in my cd-player, and this music is. next to my heart.Bilbo. Just what did I actually know about this Bilbo. Oh, yes he was that hobbit-guy that picked up the Ring from the creature Gollum. I have read the forewords of LOTR. But oh my god. Complexity lies hidden, it seems, in each and every character. Bilbo freaked my out. Scared me more than Gollum (`my precious\' shivers still in my bones). What exactly did that ring do to him? One scene has given me the most disturbance (and if someone does not want to know, please do not read further). When Frodo reaches Lothlorien, and re-meets with Bilbo, there is screen magic. As they talk (and he looks so much older already), he gives Frodo the sword. He tells about it\'s magic, how it glows blue when orcs are near. Ian Holm is absolutely heartbreaking as Bilbo. Then comes a moment. It hit my spine. He wants to give Frodo the armor (what was it called again?), and Frodo begins to remove his shirt. Then Bilbo sees the ring. Oh s**t, he sees the ring. Ian Holm is magic. ""Oh, can I hold it... just for one last time..."" ""No, Bilbo, stay away"". ""IT\'s MINE! MY RING! MY PRECIOUS!"" It is at that point. Bilbo freaks out. Make-up is brilliant, and the scare of that moment, that scene... still won\'t leave my body. Not even my damn mind. And the same thing happens with Galadriel. Don\'t want to spoil anything but the scene with Galadriel and Frodo by the mirror (she pours water in it, and he sees ""what is to come""). THIS IS MAGIC!!!! Aaahhh. Again, and I can\'t say this enough, I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN. Believe me, it is THAT GOOD. The film hadn\'t played for long, but I began to realise. what\'s next for Frodo. He is now the ringebearer. Look at Bilbo. Again it strikes me.. I HAVE TO SEE THE NEXT TO FILMS NOW!!! Because there is no end to this film. Actually I couldn\'t believe it ended when it did. I needed more. It felt like one hour tops, but I had been nailed to my seat for 3 hours already. Amazing experience. The film have no ending, and there\'s evil there, that does not sleep .

Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.For someone like me, who\'ve rarely slept without dream, it\'s so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it\'s been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it\'s been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan\'s remarkable works:\nMemento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I\'ve ever seen. But overall, it doesn\'t reach the same level of Inception.The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven\'t been able to find the very particular ""Nolan\'s spirit"" in it.The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan\'s nonlinear story-telling without being scattered";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Arcadian;2024;Action, Horror, Thriller;5.5;R;60;Benjamin Brewer;Nicolas Cage, Jaeden Martell, Maxwell Jenkins, Sadie Soverall, Samantha Coughlan, Joe Dixon, Joel Gillman, Daire McMahon;A father and his twin teenage sons fight to survive in a remote farmhouse at the end of the end of the world.;"['Unfortunately the direction totally ruined this for me. Camera so shaky I felt like my head was spinning. And when action does happen the camera just turns away. Performances were above average, the kids were pretty good but the effects were fairly poor. I usually love little movies like this but just can\'t get past the camera work. I swear it was recorded on a bouncy castle.Soundtrack was nice and Cage is as solid as he always is.Interesting monster designs but again, we could hardly make out anything we were seeing when they showed up.Overall had a feeling of ""A Quiet Place"" but smaller which I can appreciate.', 'I\'d Watch It Again""Arcadian"" claws its way onto the screen with a promising premise: a post-apocalyptic world where a father and his sons fight for survival against nocturnal horrors. Nicolas Cage delivers a subdued performance as Paul, the father desperately clinging to normalcy for his children.Nicolas Cage is, as always, a compelling presence. His performance grounds the film, even when the shaky cam and creature design falter. The young actors portraying his sons are believable as well.Overall, Arcadian is frustrating. It has the potential to be a terrifying exploration of survival, but shaky camerawork and underwhelming creature design hold it back.', ""The constant shakiness of the camerawork makes this film physically challenging to watch unless you have an iron constitution that prevents motion sickness. I found the most relief during the scene when the camera is mounted on an ATV. Otherwise, every scene rattles and blurs and bounces and trips on a rock, distracting from the quality acting, storytelling, and world-building. I would have really enjoyed seeing more of everything in the film, but I couldn't focus fast enough before the camera swished up and down and vibrated until I had to look away. In the end, I listened to more of the movie than I saw of it, which is a shame because I was very excited after seeing the preview."", ""Don't watch this move right after you eat something. The super shaky camera work could make you sick. 5 minutes into the movie I could not bear it. Just too uncomfortable.The story line is easy and straightforward: people try to stay alive after some sort of apocalypse.What is missing from the movie is the horror and the family dynamics. You either make the move very scary or you focus on the family and the bonding. Or make both the focus. However, this movie does not have enough either. Turns out the movie becomes boring and losing focus. So people can easily predict what's to come in the next 3 minutes.It could be much better if they add some mysteries to the creatures. What causes the apocalypse is not that important to me."", ""Ok with the boys being boring, unmemorable dialogue, copy-paste story from A Quiet Place and shaky camera I'll just go straight to the creature - This is a really well done animal / thing / whatever, cgi or not. The way it snaps it's jaws repeatedly reminds me of the creatures of the Darkwood game. Whatever that snapping thing does I have no idea, a missed opportunity to show how dangerous these creatures are ... But no, the adult kills are hidden and somehow they attack with the aim of a storm trooper. They also have a strange way of elongating a fingernail ... was it dangerous? Idk, it did nothing in the trap scene.Just a single bat can knock them down easily. They are thought to be very dangerous at night but after several hours of the kids and Cage outside there seems to be little danger at all. Might as well just be a pack of wolves that somehow knows how to tunnel and roly-poly into the sunset.I think the way they failed to show how dangerous these creatures are in the beginning was a huge mistake. Quiet Place did it to a child, they are not messing around. Arcadian 'things' can't even kill the teenagers or sheep. A wasted opportunity I say, now there's zero suspense."", ""The story of a father and two teenagers in a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by bloodthirsty creatures. The first thing that cannot be agreed with is that Nicolas Cage has not aged in 15 years, probably the atmosphere of the post-apocalypse has influenced him so much. Secondly, it's a twitching camera, it's like shaking the screen in a movie theater - a nightmare for epileptics. Thirdly, the operator does not know what a mise en scene or composition is at all - there is nothing beautiful in camerawork, there is nothing for the eye to cling to. Fourthly, it is very boring. Watching this is like standing in line for an appointment with a therapist: it's unbearable, and I want it all to end as soon as possible. I couldn't watch it to the end, it's beyond me."", ""A father and his twin sons have survived the end of the world for fifteen years. As teenagers, the boys have grown into young men and become independent and rambunctious. As they quarrel and go their separate ways one day, their lives are threatened again, and they must fight for survival.This is a simple end-of-the-world, post-apocalypse survival movie. The story gets straight to the point, giving little to no backstory on the characters or what caused the world's end. There is not a lot of action and a bit of suspense. The runtime of the movie is short. This might not be worth watching in theaters, but it is worth streaming."", 'PROS: The ""monsters"" were pretty unique compared to other movies (though that\'s not entirely a good thing)and there was a couple good jump scenes which will give you a thrill.CONS: There was never any background or explanation as to how things ended up the way they did, which made it hard to appreciate. The dialogue was poor with a few attempts at quippy lines that felt out of place and bordered on cheesy. Minimal character development. Actions and events felt contrived and nonsensical. For example, the monsters seemed to alternate between being strong/clever and weak/dumb depending on what fit the script. These things took over the whole word and can destroy a room full of people in a moment but a 16-year or injured man can single-handedly kill one? And it\'s SOOOOO dangerous at night, and yet, every time someone goes out at night they end up fine.', ""Most people I'm sure saw the trailer and thought";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Heath ledger's work is phenomenal no words......"", ""This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!"", 'It is just what you want for the best movie. Great story great acting, thrilling twist.\nJust watched Joker in 2019, I just has to come back and give dark knight a 10. And thanks to Heath Ledger for the exceptional performs.', 'Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created.', 'I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I\'m writing this movie comment this late is because I didn\'t wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can\'t stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it\'s hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman\'s skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson\'s performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like ""What are they, kidding?"", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I\'m not going to compare Jack and Heath\'s performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath\'s Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn\'t know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he\'s crazy, he\'s driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who\'s previous film, Batman Begins, didn\'t really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it\'s not real, people don\'t dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don\'t name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he\'s inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he\'s going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham\'s mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the ""Classy Villain that Gotham needs"", he also has brought a new thought into Batman\'s head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham\'s ""White Knight"" trying to put all of Gotham\'s scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone\'s going crazy over Heath Ledger\'s performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath\'s and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don\'t wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can\'t come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

""Rebel Moon Pt. 1"" could have, and the movie would have been ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960, 2016, 1998-2000 as a TV series, or indeed ""Seven Samurai"" of 1954), because the plot is err.... identical. And I expect the plot of the second half will be identical too. So if you have ever seen any of those and a spaceship taking off, you don\'t need to see this movie (OK, some of the spaceship imagery is very good). But I have to wonder whether anyone was actually paid for ""writing"" the script :-)', 'Well, after reading some of the reviews I sort of braced for impact. But it was not as bad as I expacted. True, the acting is well... lets say errr... below par. But so was the acting in the first Starwars movies to be honest. The graphics where above par, way beyond to my surprise. Does this make up for the not-thrar-good acting? Nope. But it eases the pain. Do I care that it has a lot in common with the original, with Starwars? Hmmm... a bit, bit not so much that I bothered to be honest. This movie is good enough on its own. Give it a chance and watch it without your mind made up already. You might end up liking it.', ""I went into this with zero expectations and enjoyed it all the way through. My only disappointment was that I had to wait for the conclusion. Reading the negative reviews I see some valid criticism, but there is no justification for the one and two star reviews. Considering looking at the overall score even with these extreme low reviews, a LOT of people are upvoting without bothering to review. Is this a GREAT movie? Heck no. It has a lot of flaws. But is it an ENJOYABLE film if you just want to ride the emotional wave of despicable villains and stereotypical heroes? Absolutely. This requires exactly no more suspension of disbelief than any of the blockbuster comic book hero movies flooding the market. Do you want to put the same filter of realism on ANY of those? Do you think, any of the Marvel superheroes make any sense at all? Its all emotions and action which this movie has plenty of. It's bubblegum. So just get your emotional rush and leave it at that.

A movie that does all this and fails to even build a world in which you feel interest and curiosity in finding out how the story will evolve. However, if the terrible world-building is Rebel Moon's biggest flaw, it certainly cannot be said that everything else is able to compensate for the extremely poor script. Direction, visual effects, photography, costumes are all so aseptic and unmemorable that it is guaranteed that nothing of this movie will remain forged in people's minds for years to come, as movies and TV series have been able to do like which Rebel Moon would pretentiously love to place itself."", ""I had pretty high expectations for this movie after seeing the trailer. I'm not sure if it's based on any source material but for a Sci-Fi movie I wasn't disappointed at all.

Can't wait to see more from this story as it progresses. Was it the best movie ever? No. But not worth the many scores below 5 I've been seeing.

Screenplay,costumes and make up all are decent. Especially the make up and movie sets are very beautiful and elegant which make the people from novel come to life. Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don't know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. other than that it is good popcorn entertainer. Loved Jennifer Lawrence though.

Now looking forward to sequels.Hope they will be better."", 'First there was Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, then Twilight and now we have The Hunger Games. Let me start by saying much kudos to the film on being popular by word of the mouth because normally we are bombarded with crazy advertising for a film like this but instead I didn\'t see that much honestly. I think the film relied more on it\'s fan base than anything for the box office numbers and it really did pay off. My fiancé and I actually waited until this weekend to see The Hunger Games to see it with a not so crowded theater and still it was pretty packed. I didn\'t know what to expect and to be honest I thought I would never get into this film but I\'m surprised to say that I really did like this movie and actually bought the book because of it. For a long time it felt like the teenager\'s intelligence was just being insulted with the bad writing with Twilight and I gave up hope for them. The Hunger Games is an intelligent well thought out story that has a clever take on our society and isn\'t afraid to tell you the truth.The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, consists of a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer surrounding districts. As a punishment for a previous rebellion against the Capitol by the districts, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, an event in which the ""tributes"" must fight in an arena controlled by the Capitol until there is only one victor. Katniss, a 16-year-old girl from District 12, volunteers for the Hunger Games in place of her younger sister. Peeta, a baker\'s son is also selected. Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, where their drunken mentor, former Games victor, instructs them to watch and learn the talents of the other tributes. They get to go on TV and get treated like celebrities until the games begin and now must face survival and death.I thought the film was very clever on what would life be like if we were put into situations like this. I thought the ""tributes"" were treated more like American Idol contestants and that was very believable. I liked the characters and they were not only believable but they were likable. Jennifer Lawrence does a really good job as Katniss along with Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks. The costumes were so creepy but believable that they would be considered the high fashions of the time. The action scenes were very exciting and also so sad and intense. These are kids who have to not only kill each other but face the possibility of dying before they can experience so much of what life has to offer. My only complaint of the film was the shaky cam effect. I don\'t mind when there\'s not much action going on in the movie, but when the action is happening, we couldn\'t tell who was getting killed and what was going on. Thank goodness this wasn\'t 3D because I would\'ve had a big headache. Also I felt like the film cuts short on giving any of the other tributes any kind of character development that you really don\'t feel for them as much.But I thought this was a great movie and a good start to the summer blockbuster films. I have to admit that I will probably buy this when it\'s released on blu ray and will read the books, it seems like a really interesting story. I\'m looking forward to the sequels and most of all I\'m just glad that we will have a franchise again where the story is just plain exciting and we\'re dying to see what happens to our hero\'s next. I would recommend for you to see this film before it leaves the theaters. It\'s one that should be experienced on the big screen because of the scope of the movie, the sets are great and it\'s a movie that you really could get into. Looking forward to seeing what Katniss will do next now that she\'s ticked off the rich.8/10', 'WOW this was a complete disappoint from the book. It lacked emotional depth, character development, relationship dynamics, and meaning that the book strongly portrayed. Like many movies based off books, parts need to be cut out to meet time requirements i understand that but come on! The director took out a lot of the important parts, almost essential to making the movie more meaningful rather than just action-pack. A lot of good parts were taken out of the movie.The one thing that bothers me most are the characters portrayal were flat not at all dynamic, there was no character development at all especially in Katniss and Peeta, his character seemed much less significant than in the book and overall appear weak. Their relationship on screen also lacked chemistry and gradual progression.The whole point of hunger games is HUNGER, poverty, the rich ridding the poor districts through those games and keeping those districts in poverty. I don\'t think anything was mentioned about the origin or the ""real"" purpose of the games. Was there? Katniss was suppose to feel unfamiliar staying at the Capitol almost angry at the way they lived and behaved which didn\'t show and which I think is also important to the overall theme. AND oh yeah the wolves towards the end was a total disappointment. It was important to portray the Capitol as insensitive and inhumane by resembling the wolves as the tributes who died.AND the camera technique/style was terrible. I was afraid I was gonna be nauseated during the movie when the camera kept moving. Kind of reminded me of the movie Cloverfield, worst movie ever by the way, I had to leave because I felt so nauseated. Director should not use that shooting style.Movies based off of books are never up to par. They end up butchering great work. I blame the director not the actors. This movie was just okay. It had potential but failed to deliver.', '""The Hunger Games"" is a film that I seem to have a higher opinion of than many people here. As a film buff (Particularly in the action and gangster genres), I am very familiar with quality chase films like ""Bullett"", ""North By Northwest"" and ""Westworld"" so I know a great chase when I see one. I really believe ""The Hunger Games"" is a modern classic that is well worth seeing. There are two things that really stand out to me. 1: Although the film (As well as the books, (That I did not read)), are targeted towards young adults, there are plenty of things in there (Fictional and non-fictional), that are very familiar to adults (Of which I am one). The fictional elements include: William Tell (The shooting of the apple in the pig\'s mouth), ""The Running Man"" (More on this later), ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (Particularly the scenes of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), having to live off the land and the sicking of dogs on her), ""The Lottery"" (The Shirley Jackson story is an obvious inspiration to the choosing of people from the various Districts to compete in ""The Hunger Games"", since with the exception of the overall winner, ""Winning"" the lottery is a negative,""Total Drama Island"" and Greek Mythology. The Non-Fiction parts include: Joan of Arc (Katniss), Christ, ""Survivor"", The Olympic Games, Ancient Rome, France at the time of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI (Check out the costumes and gardens ""I remember seeing them in Mel Brooks ""History of The World Part I"")), and Nazi Germany. The other thing that stands out is the character of Katniss. There is a quote by Shakespeare: "" Be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."" (12th Night). Katniss was born great (Unlike a lot of other teen heroes such as Peter Parker (Spiderman), or The ""Karate Kid"" who fit into those achievement or thrusting categories). Spoilers: If you go right to the beginning of the film, where she sneaks into another District to hunt, and where she becomes the 1st person in the 74 year History of ""The Hunger Games"" to volunteer after her sister Primrose (Willow Shields) was selected, you know she is someone to be reckoned with. As you learn about her, you see even more how special she is. For example: When she shot the apple in the mouth of a pig, when ""Judges"" were having a party and not paying attention to her (She got the highest grade (11 out of 12) from the judges), and when Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), her co-competitor from District 12, says: ""My family said, we may finally having a winner from District 12, and it is not me, it is you."" Check out this great line from evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland):"" There are lots of underdogs in this world,"" he snaps, ""if you could really see them, you would not root for them either."" (He knew she was dangerous, and a threat to the state). A much different scenario then with Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in ""The Running Man."" (A film that had similar themes (A futuristic TV competition involving an innocent person and an oppressive government). Think about that: Arnie not considered as dangerous as a 16 year old girl? Well if you saw both films, you would know that Katniss had more obstacles to overcome then Ben ever did. Finally the scene with the flowers where she places them over Portia (Latarsha Rose) the little plant girl who saved her life, followed by the ""Love Sign"", shows compassion and decency, and the way she pays attention and learns things extremely quickly goes beyond what would expected from a 16th year old of her background (Which is in extreme poverty, and probably without an education). This is an extremely easy character to like, and to root for, and coupled with an intelligent script and lots of action, makes for a modern classic. 10/10 stars.', 'Warning: This review contains spoilers!!!I am a fan of The Hunger Games Books. I have just read the first book a week prior to viewing the movie. The book captivated me...it drawn me into its world of systematic oppression via the madness of a celebration called the Hunger Games. When It came to the movie itself I felt as though the directors completely miss the mark. The directors manage captured the essence of the nation of Panem but have succeeded in missing the emotional connections to all of the characters and arrange the story oddly. They have added details that I felt fill in some of the holes in the book, but left out so many details that would have been crucial for viewers. The rest will contain spoilers so if you want to stop reading here, I advise you to do so. The first 20 minutes of this film was boring....it was quiet. It lacked dialogs there for it lacked interest. However the images of District 12 was dynamic. The pitiful looks of the people were believable. The bleak look of lost hope was beautifully portrayed. But the film itself was far too quiet. For a film that promotes a soundtrack, it surely lack musical expression. During the silent flashes of life in District 12 they could have strategically placed an musical mix to amplify the emotion of living in the District. Next the way they could have improved was the characterization of the people. Effie and Katnis hit the nail on the head, I couldn\'t have asked for any better examples. Haymitch was not drunk enough. The book had a comedic quality to the way Haymitch was drunk as a skunk but still had the wits to mentor Katnis and Peeta. Peeta was an OK character although he look somewhat similar to Cato. It was hard to decipher the difference between the two in their fight towards the end. The portrayal of the Capital people was genius. Their interest in the superficial and entertainment in the Hunger games was both naive and annoying. The play fight between the capital kids was a nice touch. Cinna was cool, calm and collective which was great, however it seem to register to the audience as an unintended romance between him and Katnis. Speaking of relationships, lets discuss the lack of one between Katnis and Peeta. It was incredibly cheesy the way they made their ""love"" scene. And the strange flashbacks to the rainy night by the bakery was horribly placed. People who never read the book did not understand its purpose even when Peeta later made reference to it. A friend of mine who never read the book said it look like that event took place like a week before the reaping. When in actuality the book placed that event 4 years ago when Katnis was 12. Also Katnis mourning of Rue was heart wrenching scene in the movie as well as the book. However the movie failed to show the build of the relationship between Katnis and Rue. All the audience saw, was two allies eating, sleeping and plotting together. No one saw the true connection of friendship between the two. As far as other scenes go Katnis hallucinations, the elevator, left audience sitting with obvious question marks as they looked on. Other questions that arise was, why is President Snow always in a rose garden? Why didn\'t Cato see Katnis when she watched him killed that one kid? Why was Katnis\' face so perfectly clean throughout the Hunger Games? Lastly what they missed was the setup with the mocking-jay pin. The book had its source of the mocking-jay pin coming from a friend of Katnis rather than buying it from the Hob. This was a significant piece of information once you read the 2nd book. I wasn\'t upset nor really pleased with the end of the film but I did like how they left you at the end of film wondering if that really was the end. Mainly because it leaves the possibility of a second movie that may cover the 2nd book of the trilogy. Overall the film missed so much but captured so little. I did wonder how people would react to the idea of watching children fight to the bloody death for a film. With all things considered I give this film a 5. It seemed rushed but if they do come out with the next installment of the Hunger Games Trilogy I will be there, yet again for opening weekend, with the hope that the second film will go beyond all expectations.', ""What a bitter disappointment! In order to explain what is missing from the film, please allow me to describe what I love about the books.Suzanne Collins creates a moving portrayal of a girl living under a cruel dictatorship. Set against a background of extreme poverty, these books show how the unequal distribution of wealth affects Panem's society. Those living in the wealthy Capitol have so little in common with the destitute people from the Districts that they regard the deaths of District children as entertainment. The violence in The Hunger Games is shocking because it is brutal and unnecessary, yet wholly embraced- even celebrated- by Capitol residents. As for the District tributes, they are not enemies but they kill each other all the same, some reluctantly and others with enthusiasm. As the trilogy progresses, it becomes a compelling commentary on the madness of war and the sad futility of violence. However, these themes are woven into the books in such a way that you may not even notice they're being discussed. You become so immersed in Katniss's world that poverty is a given, and violence a sad but expected part of life.The film follows the basic storyline but lacks emotional depth. The character development is almost nonexistent and the deaths in the arena are bloodless in every sense of the word. The tributes are little more than walking stereotypes so their deaths have no impact. Even Rue's death- heart-wrenching in the book- is little more than a side note in the movie. If I hadn't read the books, I don't think I would have understood the dynamic between the tributes at all, including the conflicted relationship between Katniss and Peeta. Their romance comes across as cheesy and unconvincing. There is no hint of the bond that grows between them as the story progresses.Perhaps my biggest criticism of this movie is that no one seems to be going hungry! I cannot believe the filmmakers overlooked this important point. The Capitol's exploitation of the Districts is supposed to be the backdrop for the entire story. When Katniss arrives in the Capitol and observes how food appears at a touch of a button, she cannot understand how Capitol residents fill their time. The majority of her days are consumed with feeding her family. It defines her. Most of the tributes have never had enough to eat and this is a major factor in the Games.The beginning of the movie seemed promising. The ominous mood in District 12 was just right. It is apparent that the people who live there are exhausted and resigned to their fate. When residents appear for the reaping, they look like cattle being rounded up for slaughter. The Capitol, in contrast, is frightening in it's frenetic artificiality. This juxtaposition was well-done. However, the filmmakers lost me when the tributes entered the arena.There was no sense of tension. The tributes make all kinds of noise as they move through the woods, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they are being hunted. Katniss stands about ten feet away from Cato as he snaps a boys neck and we are supposed to believe he doesn't see her? The scenes from the control room are pointless and add nothing to the movie. They should have spent that time on character development! Unfortunately, this lack of character development causes the emotional scenes to fall flat. I am astounded this was even possible, given the subject matter, but the overall result lacks intensity and depth.I will credit Elizabeth Banks with an excellent portrayal of Effie Trinket. She adds humor and a sense of the absurdity of Capitol life. Donald Sutherland also does well as President Snow. Jennifer Lawrence is an adequate Katniss but Josh Hutcherson is terrible as Peeta. He's just not very likable. We see none of his inner strength. Instead, he comes across and whiny and weak. And Wes Bentley seems to be included just to showcase his ability to grow an amazing beard.One more thing. What happened to Haymitch?! He's supposed to be a self-destructive drunk! His cunning is all the more unexpected because he seems incapable of taking care of himself. I was thrilled when they cast Woody Harrelson and he does well in some parts but it seemed like they had to water down his character to market it to young adults.This movie had a lot of potential but it fell short in many important ways. A score of 3/10 is pretty harsh but I felt as though the filmmakers kept all of the plot points and none of the meaning. Read the books instead."", 'To be honest, I was hesitant about this movie, mostly because it seemed like a new, toned-down version of Battle Royale. I had never read the books, but I feel that if a movie is good enough to inspire someone, then the book will be good enough to be read.I want to read the books.I didn\'t care for the shaky cam, especially in the beginning, but that\'s a personal preference of mine. I was highly disturbed that there was a world where children would be allowed to kill each other for sport. I kept wondering ""Who would let this happen? Why are their people cheering for these children\'s deaths and not mourning them?"" Rue\'s death satisfied that question. That was the most beautiful scene in the entire movie. Her death struck a chord with Katniss, an entire district and me. It was wonderful to finally see someone raging at the death of one of these kids, and she was the perfect vessel for it.The lovey dovey stuff was to be expected, but this movie didn\'t try to shove it down your throat like a certain sparkling vampire movie did. It was subtle, and not even something of assurance, but sweet.Just watch the movie. That\'s all I can say. I\'m gonna go read the first book of the series. That\'s how good this movie is. It inspires the viewer to read and I\'m ready for the next installment', ""I heard this is the adaptation of Japanese movie'' Royal Battle'' but trust me, I have seen both of them, all I can say is, it's much more better than that one. That movie was just awful. I just love this one. Jenefer's simplicity yet sharp moves, cleverness make this one amazing. I was so into this movie, I don't know how those 2 hours + movie come to an end."", ""I saw the movie yesterday night and truly, now, the more reviews I read, the more sad and disappointed I feel. I had really HIGH expectations for the movie, given that I loved the books. Overall, if you haven't read the books, I guess it's an okay movie... entertaining enough to kill time. But given the fact that I did read the books and loved them, I don't know what to say. I feel like they left out so many small details that seemed so important and significant to me it's outstanding the shock I felt seating inside the cinema, watching the movie I had been waiting months to come out.Number 1: The red-haired avox girl... I can't believe they left that out. The time inside the arena - it all went so much faster than in the book, like the cave scene... that was supposed to last days! The fact that they didn't work AT ALL with the starving and thirst that Katniss felt in district 12 and once again inside the arena. The medicine for Peeta! It was supposed to be an injection! A life-saving injection! Not a share-with-my-forehead-cut cream! The mutts - nowhere close to what the author described in the books. The last fighting scene - if I remember well, wasn't it during the day and didn't Cato have an armor and didn't the cornucopia burn with the sun!? And the injury in Peeta's leg - what he had in the movie was so freaking small and unreal to what the books said I wanted to kill myself right there. When I saw that, I said to myself: he's most definitely not losing his leg. And guess what? HE DIDN'T.Number 2: The filming itself was awful! The camera shook so much it was hard to keep up with what was going on at some time. And the music... there were scenes where, to me, the music was so important and still, there was just empty silence. The only part that had a decent score what the mutt-fight, but after that, nothing else.Number 3: I though the acting was great, especially Elizabeth Banks on Effie, but the portrayal of the characters was once again shallow and gave no insight to them. The dialogue had no depth and seemed hollow at some points even. And if that's supposed to be a drunken Haymitch... I have no idea what's so wrong with being drunk then.Number 4: They left out some characters that I though gave the story a better shaping, like Madge, for example, and Peeta's father, and the cookies that Katniss was supposed to throw out the window!The more time I spend thinking about the movie the more I realize that, in a way, Hollywood has once again taken an excellent story and plot from and excellent book and turned it into a movie that at the end, is just looking to make more bucks. No consideration to the message that it could have sent to the public, the same way the books did. I guess in part it's the PG13 rating that they had to work with, but, still, I'm just dumbfounded. Worst of all? I can't believe the movie turned out this way with Suzanne Collins working on the team and actually WRITING the screenplay."", ""I loved the original book, but I read it several years ago, so none of my complaints will be about changes that were made, 'cause I can't remember every single detail.Up to the point where the games actually began I was completely captivated.And then I just got more and more bored and disappointed.I never felt the continuous danger that you should feel being a part of the games (the way I feel when I watch The Walking Dead). The alliance kids seemed more like a group of high school bullies than trained killers. I realize they were going for a PG-13 rating for the teenagers, but the violence just didn't feel real or potent. It's not about how much blood or gore you show, either. It's about how you shoot the scenes, and action scenes are clearly not Gary Ross's forte.Ultimately, it all just seemed too easy for Katniss and Peeta to win. Which sadly ended up ruining the movie for me."", 'OK, first let me admit that I haven\'t read the books, and I didn\'t even know they existed: I was taken to the cinema by my girlfriend, who saw something in the trailers I didn\'t which made her all excited. So, I sat there with a clear mindset, no expectations, no prejudice, no background info whatsoever. First things first: whoever invented the the ""let\'s shake the camera all around because it makes the movie so much more lifelike"" and convinced others to follow him or her, should be shot. Twice, in fact, just to be sure...It is really annoying, and so unnecessary: it is not making anything more real. For me, in many cases the hectic and jerky camera movement seemed to be only a poor attempt to mask fact that there is nothing (or not much) happening, but it tries to make it look intense and action packed regardless. So cheap...and apart from pissing me off, it didn\'t work at all, but I admit I well may be a minority... The story feels like it is hanging in the air. Again, I didn\'t read the books so the scenes may have been adequately set there, but in the movie you get 10 lines, and off you go...and it doesn\'t add much depth later on either. The most fundamental question remained: what\'s the point? Sending 2 dozens of younglings to slaughter won\'t hold aggression at bay in itself, actually it is more likely that the infuriated parents driven mad from the grieving over the unnecessary and pointless death of their children will cry for revenge and go into resistance, or even spark a brutal bloodbath (especially that it is an annual event, so sooner or later everyone will be affected by friends or family). Also, the scale is hanging in the air too, you don\'t know how the 2 opposing populations (the ""citizens"" of the shiny new world and the habitants of the 12 district) relate to each other, which would be rather pivotal. I won\'t go on with the many potholes, the bottom line for me is that the scene was set simply poorly. The story, well, is very simple and straight, once you stepped over the inadequate surroundings. Feels painfully unfinished, and though I din\'t know there is a series behind, I told to the (rather disappointed) missus in the end that it must be so because they already have a sequel in mind. Knowing that gives a little excuse, but still left a hollow ""is this really it?"" kind of feeling in the both of us. The striking similarities with Battle Royal I\'ll leave alone... Acting was OK, considering the absurdity of some of the characters and the whole context (background and story). I\'m sorry, I\'m not a big fan of the lead actress (Jennifer Lawrence), as I didn\'t even know her before this movie (althogh I saw and really liked First Class, but somehow couldn\'t connect). Regardless, she does a good job of portraying and transferring the tension, fear and uncertainty of the situation she is pulled into, at least a good number of scenes, in fact her efforts were one of the few ""ups"" for me among the many ""downs"" during that long 2,5 hours. Kudos to Elizabeth Banks as well for creating a ""sugar-monster"" character, and also for the fact that though I know her face well enough (just seen in Man on the ledge), here I simply couldn\'t recognise :) Based on the movie itself, I really don\'t know how this can be so popular, but I admit I\'m probably not the target audience, and also the books may be much better (well, it wouldn\'t be difficult as the bar is set really low). Donald Sutherland was brilliant saying ""only hope is stronger than fear"", but that and Ms Lawrence\'s occasional shine doesn\'t make this worth to sacrifice and evening for. I have a frequent visitor card so it didn\'t cost me anything, but if I\'ve paid almost 10 quids for this, I would be rather upset...', 'Many have drawn a comparison between ""The hunger games"" and Japanese cult movie ""Battle Royale"". There are obviously similarities, but even more pronounced differences. The best example is the universal graphic violence in BR. In THG, if you observe closely enough, the two protagonists are never directly involved in the executing of killing of the other 22 participants in the ""game"". They are not lily-white innocent, not by any means. But this watering down is intentional. Even with the protagonist aside, the more gory part of the killing is shown only once, at the beginning of the game, through a series of montages with visual images so fleeting that they hardly register. One other point that is emphasized (by an instructor to the protagonists) is that this game is not so much about killing as about surviving. He even quotes statistics – 30 per cent dies of dehydration or exposure, paying too much attention to their knives and not enough to their water supply.Set in a futuristic US when the hub around New York dominates and rules, 12 ruthlessly governed districts each provide two ""tributes"" annually to take part in a brutal survival game from which only one winner is allowed to emerge alive. There is a stark contrast between the ultra-modern, high-tech game design and control rooms and the primitive forest that is the playground. The movie is roughly in two halves. The slightly shorter (about an hour) first half establishing the scene and the second half concentrates on the titular event. The much contested lead role, by three Oscar-nominated young ladies, finally went to Jennifer Lawrence (""Winter bones"") who edged Hailee Steinfeld (""True grit"") and Shailene Woodley (""The descendants""), which seems logical as her Oscar nominee was for Best Actress while the other two\'s were Best Supporting Actress. And she does prove her worth with a solid performance. In the male lead (which is really a supporting role) is Josh Hutcherson whom I remember favourably from ""The kids are alright"" (2010). Adding pleasure to the movie are appearances in somewhat caricature-like roles by worthy actors like Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Woody Harrelson and Toby Jones. Donald Sutherland\'s appearance is more like a cameo.""The Hunger Games"" is good entertainment, with a reasonably engaging story. Recommended.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But it was a great movie and is one of the best comedy's I have watched. If you haven't watched this yet you should definitely give it a try.8.3/10."", 'The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don\'t like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity. Deadpool 2 has been announced with Ryan Reynolds.Note to self: Seltzer water and lemon takes out blood', ""This movie is absolutely brilliant! It's one of my all time favourite comic book movies and deserves its' positive reviews because this is a future action movie classic! I'd say this would be after Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises as one of my all time favourite action/comic book movies. It's possibly the most quotable film of the century, the best comedy of the century, literally everything about this movie is awesometacular."", 'I am a 53 year-old man...and the target audience for ""Deadpool"" is much, much younger. So, it\'s not all that surprising that I wasn\'t bowled over by the film like so many younger people I know. And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I\'ve seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it\'s STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it\'s a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV.', ""Let me just say off the bat that I liked this movie overall. The action and the humor were both very good, and Ryan Reynolds nailed the role of Deadpool.With that said, Deadpool, the infamous anti-hero known for constantly breaking the 4th wall and just overall being unconventional, is stuck in a way too conventional movie that doesn't take enough risks. Deadpool in this film is very much himself, and there's plenty of R-rated humor the usual PG-13 Marvel film tries to avoid, but in the end, the film gets bogged down by a typical 3rd act finale (the weakest point of the film), another forgettable Marvel villain in Ajax (possibly the worst),plus the typical supporting characters like the love interest and goofy sidekick. It's all a little too conventional for such an unconventional character in Deadpool, and the movie suffers."", ""Just watched it and would say it is a bit overrated. And definitely should not be in top 250. It is a good one time watch, but sorry to say I can't give it a repeat view. Nowadays it has become a trend that any Marvel superhero movie starts with high ratings. Marvel should say thanks to the fan-boys. At first i liked the humor, but it was repetitive and turned boring to me. Looks like Marvel has got the key mantra of success after Iron Man and GODG. Just add some humor, some cheeky action, some sarcastic abuses and here you get a blockbuster. In the end i would say it is not a bad movie, but not something to be in top list. i will give it 7 stars out of 10."", 'Firstly I would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading reviews with One Star because the movie had ""Foul Language"" and ""Sex Scenes"" or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate for their 9 year old kid. Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not With that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you are easily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie.', 'I have never been a fan of comic book turned movies, as I find them to be cookie cutters. This however is a true diamond amongst glass. It is well acted, moves along at a nice pace, truly funny. Enjoyable from beginning to end and is not boring or is over longed like say Endgame,Guardians of the galaxy. A solid 8,and I look forward to the sequel.', 'Deadpool is a 2016 film that the eighth film in the X-Men franchise where The Merc with the Mouth seeks revenge in a humorous way.Wade Wilson is a mercenary who spends his time in New York City protecting teenage girls from would-be stalkers. He meets escort Vanessa Carlysle at a local bar and they become romantically attached for nearly a year. He proposes to her one night, then he suddenly collapses and is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Though she remains by his side, he fears losing her.One night at the bar that he met Vanessa, he is approached by a recruiter from a secret program. He is offered an experimental cure for his cancer, but he rebuffs the man and leaves. Desperate to live, he reconsiders and leaves Vanessa in the middle of the night to undergo the procedure. He is injected with a special serum by Francis Freeman and tortured for days by Angel Dust in order to trigger a mutation. After weeks of no success, Wade is strapped into an airtight chamber after insulting Francis. The drop in oxygen triggers a healing factor that removes his cancer, but severely disfigures his face and skin in the process. He escapes from the chamber by blowing it up and attempts to kill Francis, only stopping when he claims he can cure Wade\'s disfigurement. He is then impaled by rebar and left for dead in the destruction of the lab.Although he tracks her down, he cannot come to terms with his complexion, and he keeps himself away from Vanessa. Wade moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al, and with the advice of his best friend Weasel, he becomes a masked vigilante named ""Deadpool"", and begins hunting down Francis and dismantling his organization.Following a string of leads from various syndicates, Deadpool attacks a convoy of cars on an expressway before getting his hands on Francis, demanding for a cure to his disfigurement. The confrontation is suddenly interrupted by the X-Men Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who want him to join the team. Their intervention enables Francis to run off, and when Colossus handcuffs himself to Deadpool on their way back to the X-Mansion, Deadpool cuts off his own hand and escapes back to his home.The next night, Weasel convinces Deadpool to go back to Vanessa, but when they arrive at the strip club she works at, Deadpool discovers that she has been kidnapped, and Francis and Angel Dust tell him to meet up with them on a decommissioned aircraft carrier at a scrapyard.Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him, and the trio take a cab to the scrapyard, where Colossus and Negasonic have a grueling battle with Angel Dust while Deadpool slashes through an army of goons on his way toward Francis. Deadpool and Francis then engage in a bloody hand-to-hand combat before Negasonic uses her power to destroy the aircraft carrier. In the end, Deadpool gains the upper hand in the fight and Francis admits that there is no cure for Wade\'s disfigurement. Although Colossus urges Deadpool to spare Francis and be a true hero, he shoots Francis in the head, finally killing him and avenging himself. Deadpool removes his mask and shows Vanessa his new face.

My gosh, in the preview trailer where he is upside down in the car and time slows down as he turns and talks to the camera...brilliant! But the creativity and novelty were absolutely destroyed by the strong vulgarity and crassness of this movie. I had a couple of laughs, but this film is just too offensive. Unfortunately, I wasted 30 minutes of my life before escaping this dung hill. My wife wanted to leave sooner, but I suggested we wait a bit to see if it would get better...it did not.', ""I can't believe this movie is in the IMDb top 250. Oh wellComingto the plot we all have seen it before ....incurable disease....secret organization offers a way out .....experiment gone wrong....boom superhero.

Deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material, but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole."", ""After hearing everyone raving about how funny and awesome this film was I just had to rent it. And I couldn't be anymore disappointed. The jokes were eh like looking into the camera and trying to crack a joke or hitting someone in the crotch or even taking one up the ass(you know what I mean if you seen it). As a fan of the X-men Film series this Colossus bugged me a lot. His accent was so annoying and his power isn't to stay full on metal the entire time. I did like his other mutant friend she was cliché but was decently funny. I will say Dead Pool's stunts are awesome and that's great but I felt the movie is no where near as good as the other X-men Films yes including The Last Stand but not including the Wolverine Origins. Its okay at best not the best movie of the year but not the worst. Give it a try but have low expectations."", 'Deadpool is such a great part of the X-Men franchise, & a hilarious one!', 'Deadpool is alright as a one-time watch. It is different, fun for a short while and smart when it wants to be. It\'s biggest asset, a double entendre for those who\'ve seen the film, is Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. The role fits him like a glove. He is awesome. The character rocks and has multiple facets to his personality. Reynolds\'s comedic timing is perfect and I guess he saves the film, perhaps that was the point.The humor showcased is what makes Deadpool different. The wit, comedic elements, breaking the fourth wall, being very referential and parodying the X-Men all the while being R-rated give it an amusing edge. My qualms with this film are that they took the term ""R-rated"" too literally. He may be the merc with the mouth but the foul language feels forced as if trying too hard to satisfy the kind of audience appetites that come with such a rating. It got annoying eventually as things became very repetitive. I am no prude but the language got to a point of overkill. In addition, humor and \'language\' can only so much make up for a lack of story and substance. Eventually even if it is a parody of an X-Men film or an origin story, it is still filled with clichés. If it was trying to highlight the cliché-ridden origin stories and make fun of them, the wolverine films in particular, it did so but to it\'s detriment as it fell into the same trap. There is practically no story, substance or depth, even originality in the story to save the film, nothing memorable. It ultimately is an amusing but empty ride when you watch it the first time. The film is quite stylized and that fits the humor. They go very well together but sooner or later it becomes a case of style over substance. The film becomes too reliant on humor, stylized violence and profanity, while hilarious and pretty darn good the first time, it gets old.The characters aside from Deadpool weren\'t given much layering especially characters like Negasonic. I expected much more.I enjoyed the humor the first time but after I watched the film again, it didn\'t have the same impact. It becomes a strictly one-time watch with an interesting anti-hero but nothing else of note. The humor doesn\'t hold up on multiple watches, the characters are bland, the story non-existent, the action sequences unmemorable and the villains nothing of note. Even as a parody of an origins film making fun of the clichés, it sinks because it doesn\'t shatter them rather it falls into the same category and embraces them.The nods to Ferris Bueller were okay, for those who\'ve seen the end credits, but even that and breaking the fourth wall eventually became stale, overkill and banality equal disappointment after all even when paying tribute or parodying. I\'m shocked that this film became so big, I mean the emperor has no clothes! You may enjoy it once, it isn\'t awful but after all the hype dies down, it becomes just another mediocre movie that had potential.', 'If you enjoy sitting in on conversations that are typical of young and foolish teenage boys this is the movie for you. Every other line contains the F word and for some reason the director thought penis jokes are the funniest around.The story is about as hollow as the humor. It\'s a cheap and bland story about revenge and invincibility painted with a veneer of ""love"" that is as misguided as the character\'s personality.The movie is littered with sarcasm and cynicism that just becomes depressing after a while.Ryan Reynolds acts like a 13 year old boy throughout the movie, cursing and making penis jokes and then talking to the audience thinking he is very funny. This is the most overrated movie I\'ve seen. Most of these reviews on IMDb had to have been paid for. Hollywood had to have paid for this hype or people these days have really low standards. This is a low brow film like no other.Save 2 hours of your life and do not watch this movie.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Great storyline. Just as dark a universe as we've come to expect from DC. The gloomy, gritty, dark tone of this film is exactly what I wanted. When you think the movie is over, there's more. Beautiful cinematography. Great score."", ""3 hours hero movie...\nIt might be quite an adventure for those who expect action-packed movies like Avengers or The dark knight.The batman is not an action movie. It's a noir detective film..\nJust enjoy the dark, moisty mood this movie has.If you enjoyed movies like Zodiac, Se7en i'm sure you'll love it\nGo to the theatre immediately."", ""I have been absolutely fizzing to see 'The Batman' from the day it was announced, but even more so from when I first heard it described as being inspired by 'Se7en' - one of my favourite psychological thrillers of all time. Were we finally going to get the raw and gritty Batman film I'd always dreamed of seeing? We certainly were.Where to begin? The biggest thing that struck me with this film was just how much time we got to spend with Batman, as Batman. There is very little of Bruce Wayne in this movie and I'm absolutely fine with that. The movie is Batman's story and we are with him from start to finish. We even get some narration from him, which I'm not quite sure how I feel about just yet. It was very good narration but I'm not sure he's a character I want it from.The Riddler in this movie is phenomenal. After The Joker in 'The Dark Knight' this is absolutely my second favourite Batman film villain. He was clearly inspired by the Zodiac killer and what an inspired choice. Also the use of the riddles in the film is nothing short of genius. These are very clever riddles and puzzles and make Batman have to do some serious detective work - something I've always wanted more of from him in the previous films.This is my favourite incarnation of Catwoman to date. I haven't loved her character's place in the films in the past. I've found she slows everything down and brings out a dull side of Batman that I haven't enjoyed. In this film though she was used perfectly. She's the love interest and a villain/anti-hero all in one. That is massive because it saves another thing that can often bog down a Batman film - the pointless love interest.The Penguin was probably the one letdown for me. From what I'd seen in the trailer I suspected this may be the case. I'm wondering if they were using this movie as a set-up for him and then in the second film he will evolve and have a lot more to do. In this one though I just found him quite a dull screen-presence.Robert Pattinson as Batman blew me away. He looked great and his voice was perfect. He was extremely intense and very menacing. Even though I knew he was more than capable of playing the role, I think I still needed to see the end product just for confirmation that he had what it takes. He absolutely did and then some.The film has quite a unique feel. There are scenes and sequences in this film that would feel out of place in both Tim Burton's Batman universe and Christopher Nolan's universe. But then there are little aspects from each of their respective films which clearly inspired parts of 'The Batman'. It basically took the best things from each of them and then twisted them into it's own style - while obviously adding a lot of its own stuff also. It's very well done in that sense.The Batmobile in this movie is awesome. There's just no other way to put it. The sound it made and the vibrations it sent through my cinema chair were bone-chilling. The chase sequence in this movie with The Penguin is one of the best I've ever seen.The film is long at just under 3 hours but it really never feels like it. There's a short period in the middle of the movie where everything slows down for a little while. That really is the only flat part of the movie however. The rest happens at a break-neck pace.It's hard to find enough good things to say about this movie. I need to see it again and digest a couple of things for a little longer, but for now I have it firmly sitting in second place behind 'The Dark Knight' in my order of favourite Batman films. 10/10."", ""The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10."", 'High production value for a very soulless movie. Love Pattinson, but his Batman missed the mark. Too brooding";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Many folks came in expecting the next Star Wars and were disappointed, to say the least.  It's not like Star Wars.  It's kinda like a live action comic book.  Visually stunning, awesome use of color that just jumps out at you, and non-stop action, lots of it done with tongue firmly in cheek. Plot?  Well forget the plot, it's the weak point of the film.  But hey who ever said comic books had to have strong plots? Willis, Jovovich, and the rest do a fine job.  I especially like the casting of Jovovich, she exudes innocence, vulnerability, sex, exotica, intelligence, and kung fu machismo all at the same time. So turn off the cynicism sign as you watch and just enjoy the ride.  Great stuff!"", 'One of the greatest sci-fi movies ever, wrapped up in one of the most subtle love stories ever. The characters are well cast and well acted. The creature costumes and effects are amazing for their time. The story is unique and dynamic. A true classic.', ""Most sci-fi films try to break new ground with special effects and visual eye candy, but The Fifth Element created a whole new concept in the genre: the art-action science fiction.While this film has many flaws, particularly in the flow of the plot, visually, it surpasses most sci-fi films I have ever seen. Not even Planet of the Apes (2001) could compete with this film's cinematography. I firmly believe 1997 was a great year for this concept of film, considering the highly visual Alien Resurrection came out the same year. Hopefully, some of the more modern sci-fi films will encompass some of the visual ideals this film set forth."", '22 years later and this film is still next level compared to the best films today, even today it still plays like a new blockbuster and is excellent entertainment.\nComedy, action and sci-fi are regularly overlaid on top of each other, the volume of content this film manages to squeezes into ~120 minutes is totally amazing and waste scenes are non-existent. The comedy is actually unique and funny and it mixes well with the action. The sci-fi is great and the view of the future is still intriguing (sleeper cells in airplanes, apartments with vertical storage and reconfiguration, instant makeup devices, instant food devices, flying cars, trains that ride vertically up super tall skyscrapers, smart rifles, nuclear powered jetliners, medical devices that can reconstruct human bodies, etc). The acting is great and the characters really come across as real. The action is excellent and is greatly enriched by the previously mentioned overlays.This should really be taught as an example in film school of how to do movies right.', 'This movie is a somewhat forgettable, but fun sci-fi stylized and pleasing action flick, with Bruce Willis at his typical 90-s action star performance and charm, and not to forget the charms of Milla Jovovich as an untameable feminine beast of alien origin. That, and cute, cool (literately fogging with frost) flying cars and some state of the day special effects. In short, if you want some light sci-fi action fun from the 90-s, this is an OK movie for you.', ""The Fifth Element is weird, wacky, creative and cheesy as hell. It has one of the most ham fisted love stories I've ever seen, a truly ridiculous lore and over acting out the wazzoo.But this film's boundless creativity, art direction, costumes and performances really sell it. I wanted to know more about this film every second. I appreciate something like this coming from a true auteur like Besson, with his weird edits and cinematography accentuating the wonderous tone.Not for everyone, but I still think everyone should at least give it a chance."", ""Going into the film, I was guardedly optimistic. As a result of what I'd seen in the two-minute theatrical trailer, visions of Blade Runner danced in my head. And the director, Luc Besson, is a well-respected artist whose short-but-impressive resume includes such international hits as La Femme Nikita and The Professional (Leon). I figured that if anyone could handle the task of putting together a rousing science fiction adventure with Bruce Willis in the lead, it was Besson. I was not disappointed! For its time, visually great and some funny moments. Not intellectually challenging like Donnie Darko or Serenity so no 8. The story is fast paced, but without overdoing the action and indeed Bruce Willis is actually intelligent in this movie for a change! Fanatistic costumes, really wacky and futuristic."", 'Usually I really not into scy-fy but this movie was surprisingly fun for me.I really liked the acting and characters and the cinematic world crafting was amazing.', 'After watching this movie, I can only say I am disappointed.  The only redeeming moments are with Leeloo (the 5th element) and Cornelius (the priest).  How do you act when your god and your savior appears in your apartment in the flesh and she is nothing like you ever expected?  Ian Holm played the part very well.  The rest of the movie is beautiful garbage.', ""The first third of the film is good and you think it's a decent sci-fi/action movie you'll enjoy. Then the Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker) character is introduced and it's downhill into cliché from then on. Such a shame as the character is completely unnecessary to the plot and without his ever present shrill campness that only a teeny mind would find amusing, and then surely for only 60 seconds, the film would be much better.Plus points, Bruce Willis in laconic form, nice glimpses into the future, like the Chinese Takeaway, Milla Jovovich and Ian Holm are also well cast and add to the film."", ""The Fifth Element is another fine example of the filmmaking talents of Luc Besson. Luc Besson, a creative genius and the director of classic films such as The Big Blue, Nikita and Leon (The Professional) has returned to the genre that started his filmmaking career, sci-fi. In The Fifth Element Luc Besson realises his life long ambition to make a film based on a story he thought of while still at school, Zaltman Bleros. Writing and directing the film, he skillfully mixes humour with action and amazing visual effects that put The Fifth Element in a class of it's own. Stunning performances are put forward by Milla Jovovich, Bruce Willis, Ian Holm, Chris Tucker and Gary Oldman, who returns to work with Luc Besson after playing Norman Stansfield in Leon. The Fifth Element show us how well comedy, action and romance can be put together. Overlooked at the Academy Awards, Luc Besson won the Cesar for Best Director at Cannes in 1998 for The Fifth Element. Simply, an excellent film, 10/10.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"['This movie is definitely one to remember. Despite being filmed in the 90s, Jurassic Park continues to be a classic to this day. \nWatching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. \nThe child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (""I threw up."" ""Well that\'s ok! That happens sometimes""-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). \nAnother extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. \nAs a classic worldwide, it\'s no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow.', ""By now there are nearly a thousand (not really a bazillion) reviews for this Steven Spielberg film. So, in the case of mega-hits where there is a strong consensus that the movie is exceptional (and I don't disagree), what more is there to say?! Apart from a few characters who seemed a bit one-dimensional (which is a minor problem in an action film) and the unwritten Spielberg rule that kids cannot die (taking away much of the suspense), the film is amazing. While the CGI isn't quite as beautiful as what we can do today, it STILL looks awesome. With only a few exceptions, the dinosaurs LOOK real! And, the music from John Williams is, as expected, very good. Overall, a highly entertaining film which will no doubt please everyone except for the impossible to please."", ""If you were born in the 90s or before, you had a connection with people...you absolutely loved this movie, and it made a mark on you. I think most people remember when they saw this movie first, because it was that awe inspiring of an experience. I remember that it was the first pg-13 movie I was allowed to watch, and what a way to start my grown up movie experience!!!\nEverything in this movie screams adventure, from the opening scene where the jungle leaves rustle, the shot of mysterious sparkling amber, to the landing of the helicopter on a remote rainforest island, the movie sets the tone for the greatest adventure movie ever made. As you hear John Williams glorious theme start to swell, and you see Alan remove his glasses and start to tremble, you know you're about to witness one of the most magical moments ever put on cinema. I can't go into detail on all the incredible scenes, from the T-Rex reveal, to the kitchen scene, but each one of them revolutionized what we thought movie magic could take us. Thank you Spielberg for making this enchanting piece of art for us, an entire generation is indebted to you."", ""Simply one of the greatest films of all time. How on Earth it is only rated as 7.9/10 I'll never know.It has a great plot, structured of course around Michael Crichton's equally brilliant novel, and the graphics are absolutely superb. Jurassic Park, along with the sequel 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', had Dinosaurs that were actually convincing. Of course, there was some artistic license involved - certain behaviours of the animals were exaggerated or entirely fabricated - but that in no way detracts from the film. They are certainly better than those in the comparably average third instalment in the franchise, 'Jurassic Park III'. Living in the 21st century (or 20th, as it were) this film gave us a recreation of these creatures that was genuinely believable.For all their fancy graphics and obscene budgets, films such as 'Avatar' will never compare to the likes of Jurassic Park."", ""Even though it was adapted from a book, this unique story was destined to become an incredible film. Great casting, decent acting, great special effects, beautiful and perfect score by John Williams, incredible directing. I believe this movie has to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Although not entirely true to the book, (though someone should never say a movie is not good because it is not exactly like the book because that really doesn't matter) Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark in special effects and a standard for thriller films to be compared to. It also contains some scenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep. I will keep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day i die."", ""This was obviously the most sophisticated portrayal of dinosaurs at the time, and it doesn't age a bit.  Sam Neill plays Dr Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is persuaded to check out Richard Attenborough's new theme park, only to find that he has managed to clone dinosaurs.  There is plenty of action, and the dinos look so real as to be positively scary!  Sam Neill puts in his usual incredibly brilliant performance, and you can really believe he is acting with the creatures!  Jeff Goldblum as usual seems to play himself, as Professor Ian Malcolm, an expert in chaos theory who is convinced the park is a bad idea.  The cast are amazing, the effects are amazing, this whole movie is amazing.  It doesn't get any better than this!"", ""This was a great and classic film which the world will remember. This is truly some of Spielberg's greatest work and I couldn't love it more. Jurassic Park is one of the three movies in the Jurassic Park trilogy. Jurassic Park is about John Hammond a dinosaur enthusiast who constructs a dinosaur theme park with living biological attractions. These are no animatronic animals but dinosaurs that are created to live and breath the air of man. As usual their is a dark side to every fantasy and the dream is threatened when the park systems break down, all hell breaks loose leaving the tourists and workers left for survival. Their are some great scenes with great uses of CGI and animatronic dinosaurs along with some extraordinary performances, cinematography all in this compelling adventure film."", 'My first epic movie to see on the big screen was Jurassic Park. I was only 8 years old and I had no idea what I was in for when I watched this movie. I was terrified but so enchanted by this world. Steven Spielberg brought back the dinosaur genre, a genre that was only used with caveman movies. Not to mention did it with incredible special effects. I remember seeing this movie for the first time and asked my mom if the dinosaurs were real or if they made giant robots. Those dinosaurs not only looked real but were absolutely terrifying. But what an adventure we took with Jurassic Park, the land where anything could happen with a crazy billionaire and upset employees who pretty much destroy the world for a nickel. One of the most memorable movies of all time that still holds up to this day, Jurassic Park is a film not to be missed.Billionaire John Hammond, has recently created Jurassic Park: a theme park populated with dinosaurs cloned from the DNA extracted from insects preserved in prehistoric amber. After a park worker is attacked by a dinosaur, Hammond\'s investors, demand that experts visit the park and verify that it is safe. Gennaro invites Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician, while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler. They are joined on the island by Hammond\'s two grandchildren Tim and Lex. Hammond asks Malcolm, Grant, and Sattler what their thoughts are about having recreated dinosaur species. The group sets off to explore the park. The head computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, is secretly in the employ of one of InGen\'s corporate rivals, and has been paid to steal fertilized dinosaur embryos. During his theft, Nedry deactivates the park\'s security system, allowing him access to the embryo storage. The group is now parked in front of the T-Rex\'s cage and now they are fighting for their lives in Jurassic Park.I think one of the most memorable scenes is definitely the raptors chasing the children in the kitchen. What a tense scene that made you hold your breath the whole way through. You have to love Jeff Goldblum in this movie, when he tries to ""save"" the children from the T-Rex and instead pretty much gets his butt kicked, he gets saved later and as they are chased in the car by the T-Rex the only thing he can say as this giant monster is catching up faster and faster with each footstep, he says ""must go faster"" so calmly, how funny! But there is a moment that scares me more than the dinosaurs that I\'m surprised no one noticed in the editing room, the granddaughter is scared to death screaming at Sam Neill that the lawyer left them and he replies with a dark look ""that\'s not what I\'m going to do"". I responded that with ""I have much darker plans for you"", I mean his look was just so creepy! I digress, Jurassic Park is still a very fun movie that is the ultimate adventure. It\'s timeless and I can\'t wait to show my kids one day, what a great movie with wonderful effects and a wonderful cast and crew.9/10', 'I\'ve seen Jurassic Park probably five or six times, and each time I hope I\'ll like it better than the last, and I never do. A perfectly wonderful book by Michael Crichton is given the \'Spielberg\' treatment and aside from the wonderful special effects, betrayed badly.Where to begin? First and foremost, one of Spielberg\'s worst tendencies is to find annoying personal characteristics endearing. The two children aren\'t precocious and charming, they\'re little brats, no matter how hard the director tries to paint them otherwise. The character of John Hammond, in the book, was as I recall a rather devious, unscrupulous man";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A beautiful film with a of lot complex interactions.Roger Deakins' cinematography was great. The director, Denis Villeneuve, is the same guy that did 'Arrival' which I thought was good but not as good as other people thought and 'Prisoners'. He may be someone to watch. The direction in this is very strong.They avoided the 'let's do a scene like in first movie but make it BIGGER' ploy that flaws most 'sequels'. And it really doesn't feel like a sequel. It's a different story and while it builds on the the first it goes in a really interesting direction. I liked also that Deckard's role wasn't tacked on as an after thought. It's really sort of poetic and I'd like to see it again so I can get some of things I didn't get in the first go around. I gave it a 9 but I'm pretty sure that's going to change to a 10 with a little time. It really holds it's on in comparison with the original and if this is the approach they want to take with a possible 3rd movie I'm totally on board."", ""It's very rare when a modern sequel/reboot is equal to the original in terms of quality, but this movie is that rare one. It carries over the sweeping and hypnotizing cinematography, it continues the storyline in a natural way, it references the original, but doesn't rip it off, it introduces new concepts without ruining the continuity, it expands on the themes presented in the original in a very natural way, it doesn't drag nearly as much as said original and it's got a more compelling protagonist. I have a feeling I'll just enjoy this movie more and more as time goes by, and I already love it a lot. It's a movie with a lot to unpack, and I have no doubt it will improve even more on rewatches."", ""It's amazing after repeated viewings the lack of patience or inability moviegoers have to simply follow a plot. The lack of concentration throughout the cinema, the talking throughout and some of the comments I have read is downright disturbing. This movie is high art and some people need it spoon-feed to them. If you're not invested from the get-go, just go home.Blade Runner 2049 is not your typical movie and it was never meant to be. There are no superheroes or giant robots. Explosions are scarce and it's not funny either. It's about emotion and memories and like the original Blade Runner (1982). It poses the same Philip K Dick inspired questions about humanity - what does it mean to be human and are we just the sum of our memories? It now raises questions about artificial intelligence and real love.It is a sequel 35 years in the making to one of the most thoughtful and provocative movies ever. The original movie was a box office flop which later developed a cult following and and has since been hailed a masterpiece. Ridley Scott created a multilayered world which seduces you into a nostalgic like trance for a place which never really existed and a sequel to a film held in such high regard is rarely ever a good idea but Blade Runner 2049 is a rare exception. Think The Godfather Part II, Aliens and Terminator 2: Judgment Day before it.No spoilers. We follow Officer K (Ryan Gosling), a new character and a new breed of Blade Runner on the trail of an old model replicant but what he uncovers along the way is so much bigger and threatens to shift the balance of what is left of humanity.Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Arrival) and his crew have crafted a beautiful looking film which pays homage to the original without trying to copy it at all. The same rain-soaked, neon-lit streets are present in L.A, only the Eco-system is even more shattered. Sustenance is scarce with protein farming a way of life and while there are obvious nods to the first movie 2049 relishes the opportunity to avoid the familiar and takes us outside the city limits.The cast in 2049 is excellent. Ryan Gosling carries the main story with ease, playing his detective character with an ice-cold calm until...Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, the original Blade Runner delivers a highly emotional and raw performance which I found very surprising. Not because Ford is not capable as an actor but Deckard was played so dryly in the original, especially next to Rutger Hauer's Roy Batty. Clearly time and circumstance have clearly changed him here and it's a refreshing approach.The casting choices of side characters in limited roles such as Dave Bautista, Robin Wright and Ana De Armas in her very unique role were fantastic. Jared Leto gets only a few scenes as villainous creeper Niander Wallace, the corporate tycoon with a god complex but his best 'angel', Luv (Sylvia Hoek) gets plenty and rightfully so because she's excellent.If I I had to choose any negatives from 2049 it would be need to spoon-feed the audience in scenes by adding a small flashback here and there which I thought was unnecessary. The score was clearly not Vangelis who did the first movie and made up so much of the nostalgic atmosphere in it. While good I did miss the sadness, the piano keys and blues of Vangelis for a time but could tell the score was aiming for something different, more urgent, a sense of dread which was probably more appropriate anyway with 2049 being much larger. That's not to say there aren't hints of Vangelis because there most definitely is.It has been 35 years and the need for a sequel can be debated forever. Was it necessary? No. But was it good. Yes, really good. Is it a masterpiece? I would say that it's an extremely satisfying conclusion to Deckard's story and having seen it it's made the original even better.A movie like this does not come around very often. The world needs more movies like Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, Ex Machina... and Blade Runner 2049. High praise.Best movie of the year!"", 'With great acting, great screenplay, incredible cinematography Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sequels ever made!', 'Blade Runner 2049 is certainly a Denis Villeneuve film with his impressive visuals, striking colours and imagery. The pacing of the film may be rather slow but probably it was the intention of Villeneuve to make the audience really take in the shots on screen.', 'Denis Villeneuve, you magnificent world wonder, you did it again!I have seen this film three times in the cinema, in 3D, 2D and 4DX.And one of the things i have noticed with this film, is that it\'s not the time in the cinema that takes up my time, It\'s the hours upon hours in between spent thinking about the film, that is the real time consumer. This film left such a deep and profound impact, which i cannot escape. And I\'ve gone back to the cinema twice to be ""tortured"", but it\'s worth it.It\'s a dark, mysterious, grim, hopeless, sad and lonely film, set in a possible near future where the human race is hanging by their fingertips on the edge of doom. So it\'s quite depressing. But it\'s so brilliantly put together, the closest master of cinema i think of that has done something similar, is Stanley Kubrick.Many Stanley Kubrick films were also ""hated"" by many when they first released. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for example, which had gorgeous visuals, but felt flat and hollow for many, even professional reviewers back then. But what Kubrick did best with his films, was to create afterthought. People left the cinema feeling confused and even depressed, but the movies planted a seed which then grew for years. The original Blade Runner also accomplished this. BR2049 is no exception, this movie will without doubt live on to be interpreted, analyzed and discussed for decades to come. The story continues from the original, but stands completely on it\'s own, it tells a new story that directly interlink with the original, but without trying to be a copy, it\'s a natural continuation in the same universe. You don\'t have to see the original Blade Runner first, though i do recommend it, see the final cut.BR2049 has some of the most gorgeous visuals i have ever seen, and the cinematography is out of this world, there is literally no excuse not to give Roger Deakins the Oscar this time. After 13 nominations he has now knocked the ball out of the park and is this year in his own league entirely. It\'s confusing to look at something so gorgeous, whilst painting a picture of such a sad and lost world. It sort of collides with your senses, your eyes say it\'s beautiful, your mind say it\'s depressing. Which senses are you going to believe? What does it mean? At least don\'t confuse feeling depressed as a sign that this movie is bad, it\'s nothing wrong feeling depressed, take it in, embrace it. Then you will know how it feels to be a replicant that\'s trapped in a caged mind.BR2049\'s story happens 30 years after the original, and there is three short films on Youtube i recommend you watch. These short films describes some of what happened in between 2019 and 2049. Watching them makes it slightly easier to understand some of the things going on. But the underlying theme is the same as it was in the original. What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to have memories? What is a soul? And so on.The world has gone darker in 2049, climate is spinning out of control, almost all animals and plants have died. People are desperate and lost, law enforcement can barely keep anything together, and only a small spark can set of total disaster, which is looming just around every corner. Niander Wallace has taken over Tyrell Corp and has by the time 2049 takes place designed millions of obedient replicants that does exactly what he tells them to do. But there is one thing Wallace has not been able to perfect, and that\'s what the main story is all about, and Wallace will do anything in his power to get his hands on the ""technology"", which will result in him becoming many hundred times richer and more powerful, the sole ruler of the entire universe. He is so far gone in his mind by 2049 he actually believes he is god himself, and he calls his replicants angels.And of course he also uses replicants to do his ""dirty work"". In 2049 we meet his right hand ""girl"" Luv (Brilliantly played by Sylvia Hoeks, if there is one actor in this movie that steal the show, it\'s her). Luv is a ""handygirl"" so to speak, that perform whatever task she is set to do, with no remorse. Or is that entirely true? I can\'t spoil anything, but look closely at Luv\'s character arc. All the other actors also do an outstanding job in this film, no bad performances, but i can\'t talk about all of them due to the word limit in these reviews.Be prepared going to see this film, it\'s depressing and heavy on your mind, and it demands your full attention. It\'s one of those rare films who dares to challenge the audience, and by doing so, taking a huge risk, and a 155 million dollar risk at that. The film isn\'t perfect, but it\'s close, and it shows the tremendous skills of Denis Villeneuve. And those few mistakes this movie have, are probably just happy little accidents as Rob Ross would have put it. This film is very much like a painting, every stroke of the brush matters, and every little detail is carefully crafted, it takes monumental skills to pull it of.I loved this film, it\'s the best film I\'ve seen all year, It is a must see, a monumental triumph of a film that\'s just as good (possibly even better) as the original and one of the best sequels of all time!9.7/10 - MasterpieceAnd BTW Villeneuve\'s next movie might be Dune, imagine if he brings Deakins and the rest of this team to make that movie. Yeah, I\'m going to leave you with that thought. This is basically porn.', ""Being a hardcore Blade Runner and science fiction fanatic, I felt deeply compelled to write this review.

Never before has a film made me question the nature of reality before. At first glance, The Matrix at the surface might have looked like a really good action movie with some cutting edge special effects with a kinetic and engaging story, and it definitely has that, but on my first viewing of this movie back in 2006 when I was 9 years old and slid this DVD into my small box TV at the end of my bed. I had absolutely no idea what I was in for and what I was about to experience.This movie is actually more disturbing and honestly terrifying than many would let on, especially to a young child when this movie drops some major psychological and philosophical themes in it\'s first act. The first 40 minutes of The Matrix is frankly terrifying and suspenseful in all the best and right ways.The surreal bugging scene with that crazy bug with the long tendrils swirling around in what looks like a higher frame rate than the rest of the shot around it, followed by the mirror scream and the metallic drowning scream followed by the waking up in the pod of human entrails scene, followed by the highly messed up ""How do you define \'real\'"" Where the concept of reality literally goes up in quotation marks and flies away, where the movie sets the tone that \'reality is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain\' is the most we humans can make of our surroundings - almost makes the concept of The Matrix scarily plausible - and also in a way kind of timely of how the Internet has evolved leaps and bounds since 1999 and the plausibility of VR at the moment (I mean have you seen Half-Life Alyx)And of course you have the explanation of the matrix that follows. Truly one of the heaviest exposition scenes in cinema history.And that\'s about as far as I survived my first viewing of this movie all those years ago. As a kid\'s first viewing, this movie successfully found it\'s way inside my head and left my mind shattered literally unable to watch any more. You would think that would be a terrible thing to say about a movie, but not here. The Matrix is an unparalleled and unprecedented movie experience as humanity is at the core of this movie.The first act plays as a setup for such a hopeless notion as the nature of the matrix is revealed, only to have this notion flipped on it\'s head when the matrix itself starts being a fun place to be in the eyes of Neo and the evolution of his character aswell as the rebels that he meets that teach him of the humanity that underlies every person trapped inside it under the oppression of the inhuman controllers.Once the true nature of the matrix is revealed. You can bend it to your will and then you can do whatever you want. The Matrix is the ultimate story and parable of humanity overcoming and opressive and dystopian scenario, being controlled by machines, and is masterful in it\'s writing and direction. The casting was very well thought out with Keanu Reeves killing it as Neo, aswell as Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne-Moss as great supporting roles, with Hugo Weaving as an extremley strong Sci-Fi villan as the cold, sociopathic AI Villan Agent Smith.With Neo as the embodiment of humanity against Smith which is devoid of such, follows an unforgettable experience of human over machine. A classic and terrifyingly brilliant film which may cause you to have an internal existential crisis, but that\'s just the power of this film.', 'When this came out, I was living with a roommate. He went out and saw it, came home and said, ""Dude, you have to go see The Matrix."" So we left and he sat through it a second time. This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone does a great job acting in this, the special effects are above par and the story is engaging.', ""This film doesn't age, it will be contemporary even in 2030 or 2040.\nWachowski's best one, by far."", '** May contain spoilers **There aren\'t many movies I watched in the theatre twice \x96 let alone on the same day - but immediately after the credits had rolled (and still pumped up by \'Rage against the Machine\'), I queued up for the next screening of \'The Matrix\'. I was so blown away by that film, I feared - and probably rightly so - that I hadn\'t caught every detail of what I\'d just seen. I later found out that many of my friends had had a similar reaction to the film, and I know virtually no one who liked the film and didn\'t watch it at least twice. It\'s simply one of those rare films that are so rich you just have to watch them several times.In structure, style and concept, \'The Matrix\' was ground-breaking";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"[""As a huge Snyder fan, I can easily say these rebelmoon movies have sucked.Anyone who's seen anything before can see the same storylines and character types just copied and pasted into this world.The first hour of this movie was pointless, so much slow motion scenes of Hay being Harvested, man just over use of the slow Mo.Did Snyder forget he made part 1, because the first hour was just retelling part 1 over again.What's the point of part 1 as a set up, if part is is also more set up.Didn't care about any characters, watching heroes with plot armour stand in front of hundreds of enemies and never get hit, but then instantly shoot 20 Ina line. Yeah that's lame, zero stakes.Slow monduring every action scene on repeat is such an old trick now, like we get it Zack U love it. But it takes away all the urgency of the action.After loving 300, watchmen, Man of steel, BvS and Justice League Snyder cut.I can truly say I'm not excited for Snyder movies after that zombie army and rebel moon 2 part trash fire.No doubt the crazy Snyder cult will love the movies because they can't be objective.I doubt they truly ever liked his other movies and just love the cult more."", ""I so wanted to be positive about it but it is so bad. The budget has been blown on special effects and no script. It's like one of those rip off B movies you get on the free to view movie channels. I just don't understand why it was made. The Creator and both the recent Godzilla films are far superior to this. The only reason I am giving this a 4 is for some of the special effects and action scenes- the acting is so wooden especially when they tell each other about their pasts. Part 1 is superior but I would stil only give it 5 as it at least attempts a Magnificent 7 in space type film. This was just a waste of space."", 'The first one was ok, although it was blatantly obviously Star Wars remade ... There wasn\'t an original idea in the whole thing ... And it has some really bad colour grading choices ( probably to cover up the lack of reality and texture in the sets or effects ) ... But this !!! ... Slow motion farming ... Cliche after cliche after cliche, badly and stupidly presented ... Once again it was badly colour graded ... The slow motion was absolutely ridiculous ... I mean I can see Snyder pitching this with "" I\'m actually doing something unique here in actually doing my customary slo-mo shots slowed down a second time and having them have no relevence whatsoever to flow or plot line ... Seriously, start respecting your time and don\'t waste it on garbage, cos that is all this is.', ""The Snyder trademarks are all here in abundance - endless slo-mo, rousing vocal score, long close ups etc. The cliched and uninteresting characters also dominate the proceedings - it's very hard to care about anyone here.The second half is basically one big battle, which is actually well done - the action is frenetic and realistic for the most part and looks more real than most of Snyder's back catalogue. It's a shame that the first half is so dull and silly, with a forced back story scene where the main characters basically retell their lives in cheesy flashbacks taking up a ridiculous amount of time.It's worth watching for the visuals and action, but don't expect much more."", ""This has been bothering me for a day or so now. I have literally never written a review before. But, I had to share what I'm seeing with others.I've seen people compare this movie/movies to Star wars and Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. But I mean a small town being pushed around by a massive force. Who looks for warriors to help keep their town.Anyways, it's not bad but not great either. It's a nice action movie for at home viewing. If your looking for a strong story or edge of your seat action. Then this movie isn't for you. But if you're looking for something to watch on Saturday night then just have fun and don't think about it."", ""Slow-motion farming.. Slow-motion water-refilling.. Grain-bag filling, falling, dying, you name it. This is unnecessary-slow-motion the movie.And while this sequel is easier to swallow, it continues a hollow story of unlikeable characters. And less time for world-building doesn't excuse the lack of it! Rebel Moon has gotten 4 hours, and has done nothing with it.. Character backgrounds coming out half-way during the second movie is inexcusable and poor writing, and I still don't buy the displayed camaraderie anyway.If Hallmark made Sci-Fi films, I would believe this to be one of them! Not sure why I gave it a chance, as I feel I've wasted my time in the end."", ""Little House on the Prai... Space with Celtic music while harvesting wheat, for an army who technologically has conquered space travel and clearly depends on flour.A bit of classical music with violins at the betrayal and killing of the king scene because why not. If you are going to copy famous sci fi movies, also make sure to copy their music style and the cantina band...Forgettable characters and villagers who in 48 hours became killing machines. Hilarious dialogs just to fill time, without meaning or impact.As for the costumes, baroque costumes in space, I'll just stop here.A copy paste gone bad, pretty bad."", ""Honestly, I find the reviews of this movie not very credible...Although there's a sense in the first 10 minutes that the cast is finding its footing and there's some clumsiness with the acting, once I surrendered, I was sucked into the story.Sure, the Star Wars storyline is heavily relied upon, but once the clichés are set aside and the saccharine moments pass, it actually becomes quite an exciting film.The epic battles and significant losses, even among main characters, truly immerse you in the conflict.Sure, there are areas that could be improved upon, but all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed it and am genuinely looking forward to a sequel."", ""What a horrible movie. The first one was a hot mess, but somehow, this one was worse. I've never seen such an overuse of slow motion. It has ruined that effect for me now. Going forward, whenever I see something in slow motion, I will think of this garbage. I don't understand how a fairly decent writer/director can be given a freight train full of cash and produce 2 absolutely putrid movies. I will be extremely hesitant to watch anything from Zack Snyder in the future. I honestly can't believe how bad these movies were. They make the worst Star Wars films look like masterpieces. If you feel like watching something, pick literally anything else. Just crap."", ""So this was a science fiction/action space story... It's exactly what they set out to make...and it was decent - for what it was. If you go into both of these films expecting Citizen Kane or some epic space opera, of course you'll be let down. The visuals were beautiful, the sound design was good, and the action scenes were top notch.It wasn't bad for what it was. This was an original story that Zach Snyder put a lot of time into - and frankly I'd like to see a directors cut or an extended version. I wish they had given us more background/back story on the other characters. The prince, the robot, the brother and sister fighters, etc..."", ""Hey I have an idea! Let's make a child princess killer our main hero simply because she was 'sorry' she murdered an innocent child. Honestly, thay was HIS best idea for a 'hero'?

Is laughable...The story? Seems to have been written by a 15 y/o in a freshman creative writing class.It appears as if the dialogue has been intentionally cut in many place\'s (Maybe so Wacky Zachky can get his dIrEcToRs cUt released... f\'n ridiculous). This cut in dialogue makes the film feel vapid. It makes the film seem childish and lacking in emotional depth.At the beginning of the film when they explain there\'s ""just six of them"", I had a realization that this story is nothing new. It\'s a copy and paste Magnificent Seven space adventure... stealing ideas from real creatives who came before.It offers nothing new, no cutting edge, no edge of my seat thrill. A true waste of time in production and viewing.I am REALLY disappointed in this film, as I expected better from such an acclaimed director and cast. I think I am done with Snyder, he should have stuck with turning Army of the Dead into a series in my opinion.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This film expertly balances itself right between the horror genre and the comedy genre. The chemistry of the main three characters is undeniable, and when you throw in interesting side characters (such as Rick Moranis as Louis Tully), every scene is a delight to watch. The story is original, the effects are impressive and the jokes are funny - in short, Ghostbusters is a timeless classic."", 'Many comedies age poorly, but I thought that this one has held up pretty well. Lots of special effects (which have also held up pretty well) but the comedy does not get lost in them. Murray does his absurd deadpan, Ramis his low-key deadpan, and Ackroyd his high-energy weirdness. Sigourney Weaver proves that she has comedic chops. Still pretty good, not great.', ""Very rarely can you pull off a successful blend of two separate movie genres,but the makers of Ghostbusters were overwhelmingly so.On the one hand,you have the comedic charm of Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd,and on the other,a genuine ghostly spookiness that makes you want to hide under a blanket.I recently bought a copy and watched it for the first time in several years,and it's still just as fresh as it was in it's initial release in 1984.It has a great supporting cast for Murray and Aykroyd,including the always great Sigourney Weaver,Rick Moranis,Ernie Hudson,and Harold Ramis,who is just as talented behind the camera as he is in front of it.Watch it with your family,but keep an eye on younger children,as the spookiness may be more than they can handle. Great stuff."", 'Ghostbusters was so great because it took the science fiction and fantasy part seriously (considering how Dan Aykroyd IRL is a strong believer in the paranormal this makes sense), so the humor was almost entirely from dialogue and the performance of the cast. It takes the simple concept of ""people who start a ghost catching business"" and adds things like multidimensional gods and giant killer corporate mascots. These are things you wouldn\'t expect from a comedy movie at the time. Apparently, Aykroyd\'s original draft of the story was almost entirely sci-fi action with little humor.The resulting story was dead serious, and rather terrifying. A woman becoming possessed by a demon just because of where her apartment is? Being transformed into a monster, then into stone while she was unwillingly in service to a dark god? That is scary, not funny. What MADE the movie funny was how the actors responded to the situation. They were just like normal people, put in an abnormal situation, and responded in line with their own personal character, which was mainly to crack jokes so they could handle the fear. It was just four guys, out of their depth, going in with a grin because backing down wasn\'t an option for them.Bill Murray just shows outstanding comedic timing in this one. He had me from the opening scene where he is shocking a male subject in an experiment while simultaneously trying to ""get the girl"" by convincing her she is psychic.What was 80s about it? Well, the triumph of the private sector over academeia - ""I\'ve worked in the private sector, they expect results"", and the EPA contributing to the end of the world. Everybody could forget about Watergate, recessions, and nuclear war, and just laugh at the movies for a change. If you\'ve never seen it I recommend it . The comedy is timeless.', 'While the three pseudo-scientists of ""Ghostbusters"" occupy themselves professionally with the paranormal, their sexual desires likewise are abnormally characterized by paraphilic tendencies. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) takes joy in the sadistic torment of other men, which ordinarily is limited to mere sardonic remarks and poking fun at supposedly less masculine men for their nasal congestion, short height, or what have you, but at its most violent also manifests in his electric-shocking of a male test subject in an experiment of which the validity Venkman jeopardizes in the pursuit of his perverse pleasures. Perhaps, ashamed of his own desires, he also makes excessive displays of his supposed heterosexuality, including flirting with the female test subject and later aggressively, if clownishly, making passes at Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver).Meanwhile, Ray\'s (Dan Aykroyd) paraphilia extends to a complete displacement of other people as the source of sexual attraction";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me."", 'Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!', 'Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.', 'I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn\'t know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I\'ve felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"['I\'ve seen a lot of car movies, as a self-professed car nut. As such I judge them harshly, and immediately dismiss entries that don\'t provide enough reason to care about what is more important than the car: the driver. Think of the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchise. If you care about the driver, and the driver cares about the car, you care about the car. The car is a tool, an extension of the hero\'s body, and gains provenance with the audience when it helps the hero on their personal journey. Movies that come to mind that do this effectively include Gone in 60 Seconds, Bullitt, Need For Speed, The Italian Job, Batman Begins, and The Bourne Identity. Some of the James Bond movies do it well, like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loves Me, The Living Daylights, and SkyFall, but many do not because of the lack of character arc in the story. We cannot forget about perhaps the greatest car movie of all time, Back to the Future. The shining example of how to make the car a proper star.And now enters a film by James Mangold and starring talented actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale called Ford v. Ferrari. My arms crossed, and expectations lowered, I was ready to be disappointed. Although I love Mangold as a director, somehow I assumed there would be a Michael Bay approach to the movie, putting more emphasis on car action sequences than the characters. To my surprise, not only was I dead wrong, but the film became one of the best car movies I had ever seen.Thinking back, I should have known better. Unlike many car action oriented movies, this one is based on a true story, and fact-based dramas tend to take themselves more seriously. It is sort of a shared biopic between legendary sports car designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles. The movie focuses on their efforts to beat Ferrari at Le Mans, a story I\'m well aware of (like I said, bonafide car nut). And Mangold is an Oscar winning filmmaker collaborating with Oscar winning people such as Damon and Bale.And boy do their talents shine in this movie. The driving engine of the story, if you will, is the loving but at times clashing relationship between Shelby and Miles, portrayed brilliantly by Damon and Bale in a manner that in my opinion is more entertaining and engaging than the dynamic duo of DiCaprio and Pitt in Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood. Damon and Bale have different styles of acting, but both arrive at the same place: creating a character that faces disappointment in the search for victory.Shelby has to come to terms with the disappointment of having to quit his racing career due to heart problems, and creating a winning team at Le Mans is his way of proving to himself he\'s still a winner. Miles is desperate not to disappoint himself because unlike Shelby, he\'s never had a shot at winning at a big race. This is due to his abrasive personality, despite an amazing talent on the race track. On top of this, Miles desperately doesn\'t want to disappoint his wife and son, who support him fervently in his dream. Both characters have their own obstacles in search of escaping disappointment, with Shelby dealing with the suits at Ford and Miles dealing with problems of the car in the race as they present themselves, and the trial of besting the other race car drivers. Their individual struggles intersect in the mutual desire to win at Le Mans, resulting in a brotherhood and mutual love for each other that feels genuine and earned.Henry Ford II, played by a very effective Tracy Letts, reveals in a quick but moving scene why he wants to win at Le Mans. After Shelby takes Ford on a whirlwind nauseating ride with the new race car they have engineered, Ford breaks into tears. Not so much because of the physically jarring experience of being jostled around at breakneck speed, but because of what the car means to his family name. ""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this,"" he tells Shelby. Damon, in that scene, responds with wet eyes. The character Ford reveals how much he doesn\'t want to disappoint his family legacy. In fact, the entire endeavor started with an insult from Ferrari, stating, ""You\'re only Henry Ford the second, you\'ll never be Henry Ford."" And in an earlier scene, Ford compares himself to his legendary grandfather in a speech to Ford factory workers concerning his disappointment in current company sales.Cars represent man\'s desire to chase a dream. Whether it be designing the fastest car, or driving cars the fastest. And despite all the obstacles that may get in man\'s way, the biggest one is always himself. But with perseverance and the help of others, this obstacle can too be overcome. Ford v. Ferrari manages to get to the heart of this message with deceptive ease and supreme confidence. The film\'s absolutely gorgeous cinematography and direction capture some of the most amazing car sequences ever put to the big screen. A surprising but believable behind the scenes factoid is that Mangold and the cast are not car nuts at all, and were simply moved to tell the story of the characters. This is why the movie works so well, because they understood the car as supporting the story rather than the other way around.Ford v. Ferrari is an absolute winner, with memorable performances from its cast, and my favorite Mangold picture thus far. For me, it is one of the best of the year, and as far as car movies go, one of the best ever made, and miles away from a disappointment.', ""To start off, I have always hated racing. Yes, hated. It think it's a ridiculous waste of resources, and boring to watch. I have zero interest in cars - and thus I know absolutely nothing of the history. I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen. Fantastic acting job from both Damon and Bale, usual. They never disappoint. Excellent writing, directing, cutting, sound editing.. A very whole package overall.To finish off";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The most emotionally resonant MCU film so far. This movie is worth every excruciating moment we had to wait. The visuals, the score, the emotions, the story, and ofc the fan-service. This film understands spider-man fans like no other spider-man film before it. Truly a celebration of the most beloved character in the best way possible!"", ""This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!"", ""It's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement. Viruses don't have politics and if you think they do, you can kindly never read another word that I write."", 'Spider-Man: No Way Home delivers the ultimate comic book story delivered so far in the MCU. When reviewing movies, pointing out gripes matters most when the gripes take away from the overall experience, I can safely say such a criterion does not apply to this movie.The biggest, most notable improvement and talking point about this movie is the story of Peter Parker and the presence of morality in this film. The events of the movie all act in service to the lesson taught to Peter Parker, and of course, the audience. We see Peter go through hardships and have the biggest role models to him tell him how and why he should still be the hero even the bad people deserve. This movie has it\'s themes set in consequence, responsibility, and self-sacrifice. Every thing goes wrong for Peter, yet in spite of it, the right people at the right time guide him to the moral truth. This culminates at the ending, with Peter\'s life effectively set to 0, no friends, no girlfriend, no superheroes knowing his identity. He\'s all on his own for the first time, at his lowest point in life, but we see that he still throws on his new mask, still swings through NY, and is still Spider-Man\'ing.Throughout the movie, the classic villains do various heinous things to him, and we see the ""Man vs. Enemy"" struggle. At various points in the movie, villains like Green Goblin, Electro, Sandman and the Lizard jeopardize the already waning stability in his life, causing Peter great stress. This, along with the low public opinion of Peter Parker causes self-conflicts within Peter. The great takeaway from this is the ""Man vs. Self"" struggle presented subtly by Doctor Strange, and upfront by Green Goblin. Green Goblin tells Peter that despite how responsible him or his Aunt May want him to be, those with power don\'t conform to responsibility. This idea festers in his mind, which boils over at the end. Green Goblin kills his mother-figure in Aunt May, and Peter genuinely feels the desire to kill Norman Osborne, which is a VERY welcome negative-change arc for the character, considering the usual cookie-cutter every-man that MCU heroes usually are. This change leads to the other two Peters informing him on what\'s right, which is where MCU Peter cements his instilled lessons in his mind on what a truly responsible person must be, even if he doesn\'t want to be one. Anyone paying mild attention to the film should understand the lesson this movie presents to its cast and its audience, and should appreciate it, because it\'s slapped on our faces and handled so well.The comedy was great, though comedy is subjective so I won\'t delve too deep into what makes it funny. There\'s less quirky ""high school humor"" which is refreshing because the way the characters joked and acted in the first two movies was nothing like the average high school student today. There are various callbacks, various acknowledgements of absurdity, various memes that make the jokes stick, which is welcome.The villains were magnificent. The movie doesn\'t waste time or babysit the audience by explaining who each villain is in too much detail, and rather operates best when the supplementary movies and material are known/understood by the audience. As I said, the callbacks add to this effect, making it so that people who have these older Spider-Man movies fresh on their minds can think, ""Oh yeah, this did happen"" when something is referred to. The best thing about the presence of these villains is that they don\'t develop a personal aggression/relationship with Peter Parker. They act as the force of change for Peter\'s life instead, which is good because it doesn\'t feel like it was rushing plot points, or left parts of their relationships half-baked. This movie is 2 hours and 30 minutes long, and with 5(ish) villains, I don\'t think this movie would have benefitted from the Far From Home approach of making the beef personal. Kudos to the writers for understanding why it should be this way. The ""villain"" of this movie presents an interesting question to Peter, as they are seen numerous times doing heinous things to Peter and the world around them. That question is, ""Do the bad people deserve help?"" It\'s easy to say no for anyone else, but for Spider-Man (all 3), the answer is yes.1. Green Goblin: Genuinely the scariest interpretation of the character yet. We see him go from looming menacing threat, to cowering old man, to genuinely frightening villain back-to-back-to-back. He ruins Peter\'s life for literally no reason out of nowhere which worked so well in instilling fear in me. Aunt May does the right thing by offering him help, he gets taken in and helps out a bit with Peter on helping cure Doc Ock and Electro, then BAM. Crazy villain that destroys Peter in one of the most intense brawls, kills aunt May, and leaves the place smiling. Willem Dafoe cements his place as one of, if not the best Comic Book movie villain in history, as he is the first villain EVER to have me genuinely scared and heartbroken for the hero.2. Doc Ock: Doc Ock felt like a half-villain in the movie. He was like an appetizer for the fact we were getting all these old villains. His fight with Peter on the bridge was extremely fun, his humor was fun, and his insight on the multiversal situation was fun. He gets cured by Peter pretty early on, which is what people (myself included) wanted because it\'d feel like character-robbery if Kevin Fiege just plucked him out of his universe and made him full-villain again. He then disappears, which is a gripe, but one that doesn\'t need much explaining. He comes back, makes the save, and proves his worth as a hero.3. Electro, Sandman, the Lizard: These guys were mostly powerful punching bags for Peter, there was no personal attacks on him, just conflict and general aggression. As I\'ve said earlier, they work to service the plot more than service the characters, which I\'m fine with.The fights were stellar. The fight with Doctor Strange was one of the best fights in the MCU. The fight with Green Goblin at the condo, and at the end were some of the best fights in the MCU. I don\'t need to say much more.Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield\'s presences were VERY welcomed. Two Spider-Men were just the moral compass that Peter 1 needed to get back on track, and they have some genuinely emotional scenes together. Seeing the chemistry they all had makes me want them back in another movie, that\'s JUST how good they were together.There\'s so much more to cover, but I don\'t write for Oxford. 10/10 Super Hero movie. Not much else to say. Have a nice day, and remember, with great power, comes great responsibility.', ""This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I really quite liked it and the politics is easier to follow after a few viewings. I remember being quite shocked when I found out the 'queen' wasn't always who we thought.The sets and costumes are really beautiful.JarJar isn't really that bad, let's face it he's there to keep kids happy and that's OK isn't it? Obi-Wan is great, I really liked seeing him younger.I did feel quite sorry for Anakin this time around and I think the actor did quite well with the material he had.Yes this movie has it's issues, it can be slow at times and the bit about Midichlorians still makes me cringe but at least it's original and had a story to tell. It does remind me that Star Wars was really Anakin's story told in 6 parts. The newest 7th 'instalment' is reductive and undoes a lot of the history.Star Wars finished with return of the Jedi and most certainly after George Lucas left. the new Disney stuff has no heart.Please come back George."", ""This movie gets hate and some points I do understand. Like Jar Jar Binks is just a bit too much it feels forced. Anakin In certain situations I just think, oh yeah he just wouldn't do that. Like when he flys the ship into the enemy ship near the end, he's just a kid. Plus it can get a bit boring at times.But honestly they actually nailed the story. They explain it all so well and it's a brilliant start. Qui Gon is my favourite Jedi, he is the most down to earth and doesn't blindly see how one minded the Jedi are to their 'rules'Darth Maul is a brilliant villain. The end right and the music is right up there with the best of the series. In fact the musical score in the end fight, duel of the fates is my favourite music from the entire Star Wars films.It's not perfect but it is solid and underrated, it gets so much hate and there is no reason for this."", ""What everyone remembers fondly from this movie is Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi, Darth Maul and their climatic duel. Sadly, there isn't more than a few minutes of Maul and instead we are given Jar Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd as a needlessly young Anakin. Along with these characters the movie is burdened by a general tone that's directed at children and an over reliance on still developing CGI technology.It looks bad, it sounds bad(kudos to the actors who make this dialouge sound good) and the best aspects are too brief. The Phantom Menace has been lapidated by audiences and its kind of understandable: passionate Star Wars fans can look past the flaws but to the average viewer it can be very offputting.But hey, look at what you got now."", ""The year is 1999. I am about 7 years old, and not yet seen a Star Wars movie in theatres. Thus the stage was set for my experience with Star Wars: Episode I-The Phantom Menace.Ok, so first and foremost, I realize that Ep. I is not the best of the best, but I still quite enjoy watching it. It's fun, fast-paced (for the most part) and has frickin' Darth Maul in it!!! The story at time drags a bit and some of the dialogue isn't all that great, but there are definitely still many moments that unleash that inner kid in you, i.e. the Podracers, the epic battles at the end and that amazing lightsaber duel!

Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn\'t have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn\'t really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it\'s kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can\'t wait to see the next one.Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it\'s crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I\'m even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn\'t been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can\'t take too many points off for that though.The soudtrack is great, I can\'t wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.And the story is awesome as well, although again it\'s hard to judge before seeing the next one. There\'s a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it\'s awesome. It\'s still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.', 'This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.', ""The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.Also since this review is doing well I have autism and would love any opportunity to be more known in the world! My real name is Alex Nolan and I crave movies a lot since I was quite young. I wish I could work on movies and spend time with famous people."", ""It just excels in every category! Peak cinema right there. I can't imagine the amount of work that went into this movie, every aspect of it just blew me away.Words cannot accurately describe this experience so I'm not even gonna try. I can't remember the last time I was so hooked for more than 2 hours in a cinema. So much emotion, beauty and cool-ness!It's time for everyone to appreciate animation as a veritable film genre and give it the recognition it deserves. Across the Spider-Verse perfectly shows that you just can't do in a live-action movie what you can do with animation. I 100% think that the richness of emotions this masterpiece conveys was greatly benefited by the animation and its mesmerizing style. Just see it and you'll agree!"", ""Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention."", ""The 5 years was worth the wait. Amazing animation, beautiful characters with rich backstories, the fights are amazing, Gwen's story is amazing, EVERYTHING IS AMAZING! This entire movie is gorgeous and keeps you hooked and almost forces you to continue watching, that's how amazing it is. The hype around this movie was 100% deserved and made sense, seeing as how this movie may be the greatest film I have ever seen.This isn't your run of the mill kids move, action movie, animated movie. It's a masterpiece that all ages can enjoy. An amazing sequel that sets extremely high hopes for the third movie."", ""Is the best movie of the decade an over exaggeration for this movie? To put it simply, no. Everything about this film is perfect.... well, other than the stupid cliff hanger ending. But i've learn to accept it overtime. Anyway the animation is spectacular. It has so many little details that you've 100% missed. The story is also amazing. The characters all have great writing and some with unique art styles like spider-punk having different art styles almost everytime we see him because he hates consistensy. Speaking of spider-punk he's definetly my fav character. I hope he gets more screen time in the 3rd installation, beyond the spider-verse. Anyways this movie is perfect and I really look foward for the final installation for this series."", ""I was worried that Across the Spiderverse would not be able to match the success of it's predecessor Into the Spiderverse, but boy was I wrong. Across the Spiderverse blows it's predecessor out of the water. With higher stakes, more emotion and improvements on the already brilliant animation. My only annoyance with the film was that the British and Indian spiderman were very hard to understand, but once it hits streaming services that can be fixed with subtitles. The movie sadly does end on a cliffhanger as it is being released in two parts with the second part coming out in March 2024. I think Across the spiderverse has a real shot at the Oscar for best animated pictures, which Into the Spiderverse won in 2019."", ""The first movie was great";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the movie has no dialogue, which can cause your attention to drift. Quite a few WTF moments will make you laugh and take a moment.

I could literally watch this movie in reverse and it would have the same effect of nothingness. Maybe that\'s what the director was going for. A feeling of wasted time with absolutely nothing happening.Literally these Sasquatches are so dumb and annoying. I\'m glad my 23 and me DNA test didn\'t reveal that I\'m 33 percent Sasquatch.Anyway, save your time or don\'t and watch this.', 'Almost uniquely odd, ""Sasquatch Sunset"" won\'t appeal to all.

The screenplay (from David Zellner - who co-directed with brother Nathan) is divided into the four seasons, thru which the four forage, fish, re-produce, and curiously react to their surroundings.

They seem to be the last of their kind and headed for extinction . There is a lot of gross behavior to be seen and some have walked out of theaters.

It's pretty gross to watch and not a ton happens, though I think it's wrong to say there's no plot. It's just not a plot in the way we think about a plot. But things do change and stuff does happen over the course of the movie. If you want something very different and sometimes gross check this out.

Overall wanted more, but even far from perfect is still pretty good."", 'I went in with the highest expectations and came out underwhelmed and disappointed. its nowhere near as good as infinity war !!!', ""This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own."", 'Thank you Marvel, End Game is an ending that give me speechless.', 'After watching Infinity war, I was looking forward to much more this time, still a perfect ending.', ""If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews.\nWhich is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie."", 'I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great. Probably an 8/10. You know there\'s so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the ""I can do this all day"" CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.I loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.The deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.Killing off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner\'s relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn\'t cut it much, unfortunately.The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don\'t know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.The most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they\'re changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else\'s timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.There are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.Also, don\'t get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn\'t stop Thor\'s Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn\'t really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can\'t even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,.', ""I gave this movie five stars for effects but for story not so great and i expected at this happy ending i didn't expect that bit of drama but anyway dissapointed especially the way Thanos end in the movie so lame exactly like NK in GOT so lame when you expect at something more but no this is a proof if you rush something you ruin it the note is 8.7 just because effects and is marvel nothing more."", 'Attention: this review contains spoilers.This is a very entertaining movie, very funny, and with many references to other movies in the franchise.But it is also a big disappointment. Since last year\'s snap and the reference to the time vortex in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" it was absolutely clear that we would see a time traveling story. These are usually the best, e.g. ""Back to the Future"", ""Terminator"" (especially when we ignore the paradoxon), or ""Star Trek VI - The Voyage Home"". Still, even as the problems with causality in time travels are discussed by the Avengers team, only a few minutes later in the movie these thoughts are kind of ignored. So, actually there is not one, but several paradoxons. Being a huge fan of of well aligned time traveling stories, I really cannot take this movie serious, even from a MCU fan perspective. Here you can just take people out of their time, even let them die, and their future counterparts still exist. If it would be so easy, there would have been so many more solutions to the snap problem from the start. This was really disturbing.Further critical thoughts:\nIf Peter Parker\'s friends are back and everything is at the same age, then everyone from the Spidey movies has to have been snapped.Peter Parker is at the same funeral as Nick Fury. The trailer for the upcoming movie shows how they meet the first time. Is ""Far from home"" set in the past? Then why would Happy Hogan point out that Spidey is now on its own.Fat Thor was funny for a very short moment in the movie. Later it is just annoying. And this is not me having a problem with a fat hero. But it is much more about that senseless ending for Thor. Through Thor 1-3 we saw him evolve to be the leader who is needed as a successor of Odin. And now as his people is decimated, they just blend in as fishers, there is nothing to see from Asgardian culture or technology, he looks like Lebowski and finally just says: Well, I am off. How can that be Thor who had to evolve and show his worthiness?!? It\'s a terrible twist on this major character.It is no surprise that Iron Man\'s and Captain America\'s story arcs came to an end. it resembles comic story arcs from Civil War and Infinity War. And also contracts expired. Nevertheless, it was very obvious as well, because they really reached the end of their personal story arcs. I just expected Cap to be the one snapping.While we are at it: So, the snap is something very, very bad. Unless you do it against your enemy, meaning the bad guys. Then it\'s okay, just to erase everyone from existence.And about the stones. Do you remember when we saw in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" that hardly anyone would be able to hold them in the hand, without being destroyed by their power. Remember Starlord and the others working together for that purpose and him only being able, because he is a half-god? Well now, cheer up. It\'s happy stones week at McMCU. So everyone, can just take the stones and carry them around. Ehm ...Loki leaving with the Tesseract. Yes, another paradoxon. But necessary for the cash cow of Disney in order to make a Loki TV series.The death of Black Widow. Just sad. But also a little far stretched with this battle who want to die more for the other.The mind stone: Hmm, should we go back to the aftermath of the battle of New York in order to get the scepter or could we just go to some other time in the future when Vision is around, take enough time and get the stone without killing him? Let\'s do the first in order to free Loki and save the cash cow for Disney, as mentioned before. Yeah, that makes sense.Again the mind stone: Yes, everything has to be returned to its original place by Cap. Would have been great to see how makes a new scepter and puts the mind stone back in place. The same is true for the Tesseract and so on.The soul stone: So, Cap travels to Vormir again, returns the stone, but gets nothing in return? Just in order to keep the time line in order, which has been screwed up by many other things like killing all the bad guys from the past or Nebula?This review is now much longer than intended and actually I have many, many more points. I also liked a lot a lot about this movie, but these and further points are really killing it for me. Perhaps after time I will come to accept that this movie is the end of the Avengers, but I would have preferred a shorter version with a story that makes more sense instead of three hours overloaded with too many references and self-indulgement about the previous movies in the franchise. In the end, it felt a little bit as if I had seen one of these J J Abrams movies or series, where you are hyped until you get to the ending and just see that too many things didn\'t make sense after all.', ""As always avengers didn't disappoint even with a few loops or inconsistencies. Hope marvel does more movies about some characters from avengers."", 'I expected so much from this film but just feel so disappointed by it. A poor and incoherent story with so many contradictions within it plus a total waste of my favourite character - amongst others (like Thanos himself). I did go and rewatch it in the cinema a second time and realised that, without all the excitement and expectation I went in with the first time I was just really really bored.It did have some nice ""moments"", especially the anticipated big fight towards the end. Some characters get a good inning - love Antman and, of course, Iron Man but this is my least favourite MCU film.And the ending...........sigh!', ""I think it was one of the worst superhero movies. In this film, they destroyed all the preparations made in the previous episode.\nIt was very good to use the idea of time travel and it could be much better.\nThe story of getting the stones was written without much thought. All stones were very comfortable. Changes that were ignored in time.\nCaptain Marvel's role was very empty. The character's presence in the film was really wrong."", 'Perhaps Infinity War was the film of Thanos in which he imposed what he was seeking, but Endgame is the movie of Avengers who impose what they seek, and perhaps his title, which translates to ""the end of the game"" means the end of what Thanos sought. But do you think that would be that easy? Contrary to what Thanos did quite easily? you are wrong! The Infinite War movie may have been very touching and shocking when Thanos killed half of the universe creatures, but the endgame is more impactful and shocking than him. Although the cuff will be in the interest of the Avengers in this movie, nothing comes for free, must be given to get, and perhaps the long time period for the movie that reached three hours was very reasonable because their journey to achieve their goal was neither easy nor many options in front of them.', 'No words...absolutely incredible, THE best way to end the whole series. Watching all the movies to finish with this, every single hour was worth it, hats off to Marvel 👏🏽', ""After Infinity War I had huge expectations. Unfortunately I think it doesn't follow the comic book at all because they wanted some kind of closure of the story.\nI saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War.\nI'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story.\nThere are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others.\nThe story is average at best with big flaws."", 'Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.', ""Watching Avengers Endgame started as a nice story that soon became boring and predictable. The problem is that it's supposed to end an era, to be a big moment before the curtain fall, but instead tries to pave the way for Marvell phase 4. There were some interesting moments, some funny moments that really made me smile, but at the end it all fell flat. Flat as a rug. They tried to cram each and everyone in the movie, but in my opinion it feels fake, like parading with fake cardboard masks. The CGI-fest soon became boring...except for the de-aging of Michael Douglas, that was 100% uncanny valley material. I was watching it feeling nothing, feeling dead inside. Then the woke trend rear its ugly head. Anyway, it's safe to say that I'll avoid Marvel in the future. The Endgame should stay the endgame. It's time to move on."", ""The worst of all the avengers sequence. Boring apart from some cool action scenes. Stupid scene when CA lifts thor's hammer wtf. Also we were expecting Dr Strange to show his real powers and see him more in the movie as he is the most powerful"", 'I don\'t understand the hype behind this movie or most of the Marvel movies. I went into this movie open minded after hearing everyone tell me how great it was and after the first hour and a half I was bored. It\'s almost as if Marvel has started to make comedy movies rather than super hero action movies. Now I am fine with having some comic relief but holy hell. For starters, they completely ruined the Hulk and Thor who are two of the most powerful and captivating characters. I don\'t understand why they just decided to have the Hulk become a big joke of a character but they did. I thought his main thing was that he was angry all the time which made him way more interesting than a science nerd but ok I guess so. Then they decide to make Thor just a slob that drinks beer and plays fortnite. I saw Korg holding the controller and thought to myself ""if they are playing fortnite this movie is embarrassing"" and believe it or not they were. I could not believe it when I saw what they did to Thor. The God of Thunder and King of Asgard has a mid life crisis after losing to Thanos when he has 1000 years of being a battle tested warrior and is now an overweight bum and is that for the ENTIRE MOVIE.\nThe other thing in this movie that made me mad was that they tried to force all of these character relationships onto the viewer. I do not care about Hawkeye and Black Widows weird romance/friendship because as far as I can see, they are both kinda useless in the grand scheme of things. Honestly they both probably should have died in the first avengers but we will blame plot armor for that one. I also do not care about captain America and Peggy\'s relationship or Tony Starks new family that is a thing when the movie just jumps ahead in tome 5 years. This is probably because I think Pepper is one of the most annoying movie character of all time.\nThe last thing I will rant about is the fighting. For a 3 hour movie you would expect to see some cool fight scenes but no. We got a bunch of fast moving shots and a lot of different characters running with the gauntlet. To make matters worse, Thanos was just so not intimidating in the slightest. It\'s almost as if he stood 0 chance and everyone knew it. Overall this movie was 3 hours of superheroes sitting around telling some dumb jokes that people think are hilarious for some reason and then winning the battle with little trouble.\nOther problem with the movie:\n1. Bucky should have gotten Captains shield\n2. Time travel? Really. Stark figures out time travel in 30 minutes after 5 years of sitting around and it works without any problem besides when captain America fought his past self and somehow nobody in the building saw it.\n3. Thor joining the guardians is cool but also WTF\n4. Captain Marvel should have just stayed with the avengers and try to fix the problem rather than run off to other planets and come back at very convenient times. Total cop out\n5. The hulk should have fought thanos. Total blown opportunity']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Good movie.', ""After really looking forward to this movie, I came out of the cinema slightly disappointed. Theres plenty of joke and action but the jokes seemed to be a bit meh, I only remembered laughing out loud twice and story line is a bit disjointed. The problem I had is in the DP 1 you had the shock factor of a tongue in cheek mavel character but in this movie that's already gone, so you have to rely on a good plot but unfortunately it lacked that, so I felt a little bit bored by it. I'm not saying it not a good movie but I expected a lot more but sadly I felt let down."", ""I'm not a huge fan of comic character movies even though I watch them all but Deadpool is definitely my favorite Marvel character. I guess it's because he's just a bit kinkier with his sometimes vulgar sense of humor. That's something you will never see in the other Marvel or DC Comics movies. Deadpool doesn't fit in that family package as his constant humor is just above the edge. I'm normally not a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds either but I have to admit that his Deadpool character fits him as a glove. About the story it's a typical superhero against evil like all other superhero movies but that little humorous touch makes all the difference.

It\'s notable for its brutal violence, excessive profanity, and sexual themes and out-of-universe references. This theme is continued here, with much of those things felt again. Here, though, there\'s a lot more references to other movies, which includes other superhero movies, and just other movies in general. Here, Deadpool teams up with Cable to prevent Firestarter from becoming a murderer. Many of the characters from the first movie, including Colossus, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Weasel, and Blind Al return for this movie. He also creates the X-Force, a new group of superheroes. Spoiler alert: they die. Everyone except Deadpool and Domino dies within ten minutes of being introduced. The whole ""assembling a team"" aspect, which was heavily featured in the trailers, was all a really elaborate joke. Also, Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Yukio didn\'t get as much screen time as the trailer would suggest. But that\'s okay because the movie already has way more characters than it needs, and that\'s the type of joke that only Deadpool could pull off. The movie\'s humor is great. The Deadpool movies put emphasis on humor, so it\'s important that they get it right. There are a lot of references to other movies, from Flashdance to Passion of the Christ of all things, to superhero movies like Batman V Superman and Infinity War, which it\'s only 3 weeks newer than. It also has an extensive X-Men related sequence that was very well done. There are some great cameos with the X-Force, including Terry Crews, the guy from IT, and a really great one by Brad Pitt.

But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that tur... Read all;"[""(SPOILER FREE PART)It feels like every John Wick movie is a remastered version of a previous one. Better choreography, better fight scenes, better visuals, bigger budged but it's more or less the same movie with the same meh story and the same meh characters. Of course most of us know what a John Wick movie is so no one's surprised here. And if it is exactly what you're expecting than you won't be disappointed.FIRST, THE GOOD THINGSCinematography and production design, especially the colours. The colour palette is beautiful, maybe overdone here and there but most of the time it's just beautiful.Fight scene choreography is top tier as it was in previous movies and probably even better.Music is pretty good and in combination with the visuals it creates a really stylish and pleasant to look at movie.THE NOT SO GOOD THINGSThe characters are kind of cheesy as is the whole story, it's not terrible but it is not memorable.Also there's this feeling about this movie that the only thing that the creators were focusing on is how to improve action sequences at any cost even if it makes movie completely unrealistic. And I GET IT it is not supposed to be very realistic but at least it should be somewhat believable because sometimes it is so not believable that it's just breaking the immersion where this could be avoided.The worst part for me was the disconnection between the fight scenes and the surroundings like everything that happens to the characters happens in this fake world. It felt like the everything around the ones involved in the fights is just there to make it look good and make us believe that all of this is happening in the real world and not a movie set but it completely fails at that and feels like like some kind of exhibition of fight choreography.(SPOILERS BELOW)Couple of examples :Heaven and Hell nightclub scene.People mindlessly dancing and not paying attention to the gun chase that is happening in front of them. Shots were fired, axes were thrown, people were running, fist fighting, bleeding, falling down from deadly heights. Almost nobody cared. I GET IT we are supposed to believe that the music is very loud, people are maybe under influence of alcohol or whatever else but I mean come on shot were fired...The Place de l'Etoile roundabout shootout.This scene was very similar to the aforementioned.Once again the unresponsiveness from the cars around them was very immersion breaking. People were driving around like nothing is happening even though dead bodies should be lying around, multiple people walking and shooting in the middle of extremely busy traffic. Every car in the scene felt like was driven by the NPCs from a video game that have their dedicated route and it doesn't matter if they hit your with a car or not they will continue to go like nothing happened. And the end of the scene they show you the aftermath so you would think that this whole thing had some kind of effect to the traffic but until that point it didn't feel like that at all.Also the whole fight scene was so unnecessary long just to show some crazy moments were the baddies and John Wick himself was hit by the cars multiple times. At least those moments were indeed impressive. But if the scene was at least a lot shorter it wouldn't be as unbelievable as it was.And the scene on the stairs...was it really necessary? Did people actually enjoy yet another super long shootout scene where Wick kills yet another 50 bad guys but now on his way up the stairs (twice!) We've seen that already.And the blind guy...I mean come on he's blind...All these things that I've mentioned does not make John Wick 4 a bad movie but it is definitely not the best action movie as some wants to claim it may not even be the best overall John Wick movie.If you can turn off your brain and just enjoy the fight choreography you will probably enjoy it, but it feels like JW4 wants you to turn off your brain the most out of all 4 movies.All in all the movie wasn't bad, it's a bit too long, too unrealistic and the ending is unsatisfying."", ""By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah."", ""From the very beginning to the end, nothing but endless kills, fighting, close combats, bloods squirts or splashes, KR after four chapters, he looked older, slower and tiresome. The screenplay was so pretentious and pointless, the dialog looked forced and boring, katana swords vs. Bullets, and almost every bullet could be fenced off by the katana sword blades. The scenarios and the plots just kept stacked up without any reason or clue, just kill, kill, kill...nothing but kills. All the fighting sequences just like Shaw Brothers' 1970s poor and laughable Hong Kong martial art movies, heavily choreographically staged, looked so forced and fake. Every kill was not killed with one bullets but many, yet the handguns seemed equipped with endless bullets, bang, bang, bang, even the fallen guys already dead, but still needed to be shot several times more to increase the violent sound effect. I don't know what's the purpose of making these 4th Chapter, and I think the 1st Chapter only needed a following 2nd Chapter to end it, but what the heck, brainless young viewers need bloody fights, more dead bodies, ridiculous screenplay with clueless storyline, no real plots or real story really needed, just created something like violent video games.When John Wick fought for his life in the Japanese hotel against so many clueless foes and the Zatoishi-like blind swordsman played by Donny Yen with a Botox injected face, we all decided to quit at the same time.Hey, it's time to wrap it up, guys, no sense to continue to Chapter 5!"", 'Keanu Reeves is freaking Awesome this is by far his best performance yet. Director Chad Stahelski gives us the Best Action movie in the history of Cinema. The action is crisp well directed and it is beautifully choreographed. The villains are the best in the franchise Billy Sarsgard and Donnie Yen are amazing. The rest of the cast is awesome as well. The directing, writing , plot ,ending and the begging is perfect. It never feels too long or short , the runtime is well handled. The side characters like Winston,Killa and Charon once again steal the big screen every time they appear in the movie.', ""Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.Covering four continents, we get fights on a massive set of stairs, fights in the middle of traffic, at one of the coolest looking hotels ever shown on screen, and so on. The fighting, of course, is exceptional, and it brings nunchakus, dogs, throwing stars, swords, guns, and so much more. It's everything a John Wick fan could want and, because these films are so technically proficient, you never feel like you're missing any of the action. Possibly the most creative choice is my favorite scene, one that combines a visually fantastic weapon with a shot choice that is unusual for action films of this nature, but the combination of these two pushes the scene into maybe one of action film's greatest scenes.Admittedly, the story does leave a bit to be desired, but the minor complaints about these kinds of things pale in comparison to what we get. Hollywood has a new film to hold itself to and I have a feeling that (at least for me) action filmmaking will be judged by the standard this movie sets. It's such a blast, I already want to see it again."", ""For a conclusion to a franchise (at least the Wick story arc) you'd expect story. Each movie has gotten a little further away from telling an interesting story. I even enjoyed when they layered in more of this far-fetched stuff with the high-table & continental in 2 & 3. But, we still don't know much about this world, how it was created, or who is in charge. I thought this movie would do more with this secret government for criminals, but instead this movie made those aspects of the story pointless. So many elements from the past movies were just glazed over to essentially give this movie no story. No Elder, No Winston's betrayal, No past characters except Winston & The King, No Dog, No Wife. All of those things amounted to a few 1-liners in this movie. Instead they focused on the worst aspect of 3 and multiplied it with fights that last too long, and people that need to be shot 20 times. I personally preferred the realism and tactical focus to the action of 1 & 2."", 'We all walk into John Wick 4 with expectations of what we will see, standards we refuse to lower and excitement already creeping in. From the first second it engages you, no hesitation, no quarter. And it\'s only the beginning. I read somewhere that a reviewer had said that there wasn\'t a wasted moment in this film and I watched it questioning the validity. They weren\'t wrong. Each conversation has a purpose, each scene makes a point. From the gunfight samurai scene in Tokyo to the phosphorus gunfight shot from above in Paris, the action doesn\'t diminish. Normally a sequel is ""lesser"" but John Wick 4 simply builds onto the quadrilogy. It makes sense, it continues the story and the characters get all the more interesting.I can tell you right now, if the phosphorus gunfight scene doesn\'t impress you (which it will), the Paris traffic carnage scene is brilliant. I can\'t say I have ever seen someone do full continuous 360 drifting in a muscle car either :DI know Keanu said that Chad Stahelski and himself were taking a long break from the John Wick series but should we have seen the end, it ended on a note I feel we could live with. If they can find another story that will build onto the John Wick series then so be it but if not, I truly left the movie happy and felt it was done.Don\'t leave until after the credits are done. Trust me, it\'s not finished.', ""The story was ok but could have been better flushed out. Fight scenes are great but they were way too long and so unrealistic. Not nearly as good as the other 3 movies. If they would have given us a little more background on some of the new characters it would have made more sense and given them more depth. In previous movies John would use his Krav Magra skills to take down or slow down someone then a double tap to the head would usually be sufficient. Those fight scenes were outstanding and believable. Almost all of fights in this movie ridiculous. People were shot and stabbed several times and looked like they weren't hurt. How many times did John get hit by a car and just walked away? How many times do you have to hit someone in the face with nunchucks before they go down. I used to think John was special. The Baba Yaga. But in this version he is made to look almost invincible. Really, did they have to get so far away from reality this time. I left somewhat disappointed. Was I watching a movie or a video game?"", ""Think it's gone too far past how great JW1 was,just over hyped now. How is all this action happening with no police any where?A blind man shooting people but no one can shoot him ?? The main body guard for the main villain should of been killed plenty of times,JW puts bullets in people who you know are dead but leaves this guy in the middle of the road when he's the main threat??How is all the violance happening in the street and night club and no one batters an eye lid ??why did he leave the underground to go to the church that's obviously miles away to then end up in a shootout ? Surly he got of go there easier ? The overlay of the radio DJ at the end was annoying,how did she know where he wa aging to be constantly??"", ""In my opinion this is by far the worst movie of the franchise. It's just way too over the top. Everybody seems to have magical jackets now to stop the bullets.Audience loved the dogs on the third one so that just lazily copied one here also but didn't bother to have any real cool scenes with it.I'm happy they made John Wick 1 but since then every movie getting worse and worse. This one was already so bad that I regret spending any money to see it.People shooting and dying in center of Paris but police doesn't seem to care.John Wick getting shot, falling from great heights etc without any issues."", 'Indiana jones, terminator, predator, Jurassic park, the matrix, Jason bourne, etc. All amazing franchises but all share a common trait of having a bad or forgettable movie or 2 at some point.

The simple-in-the-extreme plot of ROAD HOUSE offers no new surprises and is merely a modern updating of the western, with added mullets, but it seems fresh and stylish on every viewing. Swayze is a likable hero and a hit with boring love interest Kelly Lynch, but he also studies philosophy and kicks backside with martial arts too. His lakeside fight with Marshall Teague is the stuff of legend and a wonderful showdown between the two tough men.There's a varied supporting cast including slimy, weaselly Ben Gazzara as the rich property owner who gets shotgunned to death, and Sam Elliott in a cool role as Swayze's old-time buddy. But the focus is on action, and we get tons of lengthy and gruelling knife-fights and beat-em-up-battles which tend to stress the realism. The tension in the Double Deuce scenes is spot on. Not just a good film, a very good one with plenty on offer to appetise those who follow fight flicks."", ""This is the kind of movie that's very hard to rate.

On the other hand, once you start getting paid you might be tempted to take it up a notch.One thing I didn't get, maybe I missed it, is why they didn't try a lineman's pole style to get down.

It can't be scary, because it's so stupid to go up that ladder with no plan b, not contacting someone about your climb, no one at the bottom in case of emergency. The list goes on.

The worst part is that these studios aren't getting the point. You need a script that's original. CGI has to look real and good. There's no real audience for this stuff anymore.

A new villain should have been added so that I do not feel like I am witnessing the same previous movie with some simple changes.Secondly, the new villain does not count.

By the end it wasn't a complete let down, it was actually pretty cool, fun, and funny in some moments! Although the film suffers from being shallow and impractical sometimes and was lacking with the romance angle of it (understandable why Amber Heard couldn't be in the movie as much), I actually really liked seeing the characters and arcs of Black Manta and Orm. They had cool and good moments and were actually more interesting than Arthur/Aquaman himself! I don't see how anyone can really hate this. It's somewhat lacking with some things but it's not THAT horrible. Plus it had an intense and captivating boss fight at the end!"", ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a movie that has no reason to exist other than contract obligations. It's boring, offers nothing new to the genre and gives us the most cookie cutter DC super hero movie since... The Flash. Surprisingly enough the Flash is better. The main objective this film is purely to get to the end. There's no emotional connections to characters, there's no reason for me to feel anything. The action is below average, the cgi is meh and the acting is even worst. This is just all around a bad movie... a cash grab... a let's move on to the James Gunn universe now.

If you are looking for big action family movie then this is the movie for you!!! Plus it's a beautiful looking movie!!!!Don't expect any great story or character arc!!! That was never the case of Aquaman!!! It's a movie that looks gorgeous and delivers some epic action!!! Plus great humor!!!!"", ""This is a good movie. The action is still really fun and well choreographed. That fun comic book flavor is still very much present. It's another adventure which I think is a genre that fits Aquaman well. The issue is the story is flat out bad. I don't know how this passed through a chain of command and everyone said yes. The script is even worse. Oh wow this a really bad script. There were moments I actually physically cringed at the dialogue. I don't know what Jason Momoa was doing in this film but it wasn't acting. Patrick Wilson was the biggest standout and I enjoyed him most on screen. He made Jason Momoas performance bearable. This is also coming from a Jason Momoa fan. This is without a doubt his worst performance. Amber Heard is barely in the film but oh wow she's really bad in this. I actually liked her in the first film but she's awful in this one.

A disappointing end to the DCEU no doubt."", ""How can a movie resonate with the viewer, if the story builds for two hours, and ends in 10 seconds? How can a writer think that this will have an impact on the viewer?Well, the film feels and looks like a comic book. It is an simple comic book storyline, It feels kinda like a saturday morning cartoon. This is a great look if you're going for an animated movie, but for a whole picture that is demanding towards older audiences.. this is a problem. An problem which Hollywood doesn't seem to care about. Because I've seen this in almost every high-budget adventure film this year.It is always the same structure. The Hero returns and needs to save someone or defend somewhere, one that is near to him explains that he needs to get to A because at B him awaits an creature, that is much stronger than him. So he needs to get an item, or in this specific case, get an person, that could help him. AND very important to note here, is that the villain always gets teased at this part as this demonic, highly frightening creature.In the end, he's mostly just an huge piece of plastic or an huge piece of Green-Screen. Or, the worst case, he dies in merely 60 seconds after his great appearance.While this kind of storytelling overshadows what audiences REALLY want, and what potentially great writers could achieve if there would be more demand for interesting, immersive concepts and ideas in Hollywood, at least, please, try your best in writing your characters Appealing.The first Aquaman is simple, it's basic, but in it's first minutes it's already emotionally resonating and has GREAT camera-angles that psychologically just attracts someone to stay for more. The movement of the camera was immediately grabbing. And in the end, you got an work of art which is intense, epic and emotional at once, just because the filmmaking does the best out of it.So, either have a great script, or have a great filmmaker, a great sound-editor, cinematographer, composer, color-grader, visual effects artist..Filmmaking is not without reason called an art-form."", ""Now here's a film that defines sink not swim, stuck at the bottom of a barrel and grim, generally lacks whit, a rotten limpet, as decayed as old driftwood washed up with chagrin. The acting is awful and the script is so poor, the story is daft and an absolute chore, your eyes will soon close, recline and repose, it won't be too long before a snooze and a snore. The special defects just do not overwhelm, the buck has to stop with the guy at the helm, will the franchise now learn, how to make this ship turn, or let the corpse drown, in unpotable realm.It really is as bad as you could possibly imagine."", ""Aquaman 2 is a disappointment movie. The plot is so banal and predictable that you can understand practically the entire story from the first minutes of the film.The story is full of clichés and repetitive situations.The characters are even more banal than the plot.

If you liked the first Aquaman, go and see this second film, but if you didn't like the first Aquaman film or didn't like it very much, then forget about Aquaman 2 too, because you won't even like this second film, this second film is inferior to the first film.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It's such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe.

Think before I act, not try to be cocky all the time, be less toxic around people and my loved ones. And overall, 2022 and 2023 got so much better for me. My school performance improved and so did my social life.And I hope it forever will improve the lives of other people too. Thanks for reading."", ""What better, more urgent message can a film have these days? What's so uncool about movies with messages anyways? Sometimes we desperately need them. I read a couple of reviews lightly mocking any attempt to find deeper meaning amid all the silliness, as if there wasn't enough already on the surface. What if we stopped equating tiny with insignificant? What if the more minuscule we discovered ourselves to be, the LARGER our world became, and the more SIGNIFICANT we felt? So it's not surprising that Daniels take us on the most inventive, overstuffed, relentless journey only to land us in the simplest, most heartfelt of places. That's the real judo-move here -- an infectious, goofy sweetness that extends even to the (hundreds? Thousands?) of action set pieces. Anyone can dimension-hop and fight the baddies. This combination of heart and spirit is the Daniels own. Also, for anyone who's putting together the next time capsule of human civilization, please consider the scene of Michelle Yeoh and Jaime Lee Curtis dancing with wiener fingers."", ""There's a point here where we are swept up in sensory overload, where so much stuff is thrown at us that we tune it out. I reached a point about two-thirds through this where I couldn't get my mind back in it. Have we reached a point where we have no expectations of a conclusion. When one has someone playing multiple characters in multiple settings, there needs to be something tying it together. The protagonist needs to be someone we identify with who has wishes and hopes that lead us on. She seemed as confused as the storyteller and the husband. I guess I'll read some more about this film and hope with guidance to try to figure it out a bit. Obviously, all these universes and all this actions (way too much battling in my estimation) are leading somewhere. I thought the film had ended about six times. I don't mind being brought back in, but I wish I understood where we just landed. Yes, there is a lot going on and it is violently splashed on the screen. But I ended up exhausted and unsatisfied."", ""There's really something for just about everyone in this movie. It's part Kung-fu action, part absurdist comedy, part cerebral sci-fi, and part indie family drama. I think this is an instant classic that uses the art of cinema and movie-making to it's fullest potential.They really throw everything AND the kitchen sink at the wall and somehow it all sticks and becomes a really fun and really special film that I would recommend to pretty much anyone.Michelle Yeoh is fantastic as is the whole cast. The writing and direction is phenomenal and innovative and creative and it features of the best editing I've ever seen. It's a really wild movie, but if you sit back and absorb it, I think you'll have a good time."", ""This film almost unanimously received praise from both critics and audience alike. People even exaggeratedly rank it as one of the greatest films ever or the best they've ever seen. Going into this movie, my expectations were really high And I really wanted to be part of the majority who loves this movie. But unfortunately the opposite happened and I didnt like it. While I appreciate that this movie was made on a relatively small budget and managed to get some things right as it had so much potential with its strong female lead, philosophical component and some good action to move it along. But it fell really short. It is long and meandering. Visually confusing, thematically unoriginal. The first half was repetitive, boring and also quite silly. Half of the time I don't know what are they fighting for or what the heck is going on. And what was supposed to be the multiverse just felt like the characters were wearing silly different costumes. It is not until the last act that things of relevance happened. The performance from the cast was great though."", 'A lousy movie. The underlying themes are the best there are but are used in a way that is nothing short of shameful. Two and a half hours of pure dementia, arrogance and useless effects without any substance. I wonder how this film can be considered as the best of the first half of 2022. A waste of time, health, expectations and enthusiasm. Garbage.', ""This might be the most accurately titled film I have ever seen. Afterwards, my wife asked me what it reminded me of. I was stumped. What genre was it? Hard to say. This is a movie that morphs from immigrant drama to sci fi to Kung Fu to comedy to existential art flick and back again. Then it does that loop again, faster and faster and faster, without ever losing the audience. I saw it in a packed theater, everyone laughing and crying and caring. Perhaps most amazingly, this was a pretty simple and effective relationship story through it all. I don't know if I would rather watch it again right now or watch a documentary about how the film took shape. Either way, I'm glad it exists. I lamented multiverse stories after the last MCU film, and I guess I have to take that back now. It is possible to tell wildly imaginative genre bending multiverse stories. You just don't need superheroes to do it (unless you count the Daniels).""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Even when he says things...it's not dramatized... People make fun of him. He's human...People don't believe him...pretty normal.This is a movie you have to watch before you waste your bucks on Karan Johar and gang.

What starts out as college ragging causing teenage angst soon snowballs into a mess that threatens their existence. It's a usual story that you have seen before but what you haven't seen ever before is the central character of Ranga (Fahadh Faasil). It's obvious that even Faasil and the rest of the cast also had a ball shooting this film, which is full of booze, excitement, and raw energy. It's amazing how he took the role and added some fresh zing to it.

Usually roudis are created by the situations around them. They missed so many good option to turn this movie interesting.

Entertaining overall, but agree with other reviewers that it felt more like a typical and cliched action movie, particularly in the second half - more of a parody than a homage. Above all, while it's reasonable to modernise the Bond character, we may have now reached a point of no return for the spirit of Fleming's real Bond. The next movie will be make - or I fear break - to the substance of what has made Bond movies distinctive and great."", ""The story is really engaging. It didn't feel like 2.5 hours! I enjoyed every second of it. I like the bond between Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux. The ending got me tearful. Who would have thought James Bond would make someone cry?"", ""And so, after endless delays and endless fanfare, we finally have Daniel Craig's final Bond outing. And after all that, the end result is merely average. I enjoyed it, to a degree, but I can tell it's not one that will particularly stand up to repeat viewing. It's overlong, way overlong, with a very slim plot and a story that feels copied from earlier instalments almost scene-for-scene at times. The action is too much about the stunts and CGI and not enough about the suspense or danger, and the whole thing simply goes through the motions. Rami Malek is far too sympathetic to make a good bad guy, and the main problem lies in employing the same two screenwriters for the past 20+ years. No wonder it feels stale. How about giving somebody else a chance?"", ""Great ending, but would have liked a different ending. I always thought Daniel Craig was great as James Bond, and don't understand the haters at all. I liked the way Casino Royal was done. (The last film with Pierce Brosnan was just ridiculous, and more of a comedy). The five films with Daniel Craig fit completely into today's time, and his realization of James Bond was special. Harder, but also more human and emotional. It's a pity that it's over now."", 'James Bond (Daniel Craig) is married to Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux). She has a secret past. He\'s visiting the grave of Vesper Lynd when Spectre attacks. Blofeld claims that Madeleine is a daughter of Spectre. It\'s five years later. Bond is retired and living alone. Russian bio-weapon scientist Valdo Obruchev has been kidnapped by new baddie Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek). MI6 and the CIA are at cross-purposes. Both are searching for Obruchev.This reportedly is to be Craig\'s final outing as Bond. This feels very much like a lot of James Bond\'s greatest hits. There is golden hour shot near the end where I realize that this is really the golden hour of Craig\'s Bond. The sun is setting on his tenure. Madeleine talking to Mathilde is tinged with nostalgia. She\'s telling her about his past. His chapter of the book is done.As for the movie, it opens great. There is a great chase in the narrow streets of an Italian mountain village. I love the motorcycle jump. It\'s so simple and so clean. There are no jumpy cuts or shaky camera work in that shot. Ana de Armas has a great introduction with her ""three weeks of training"". I like M\'s duplicity. I\'m less enamored with Blofeld\'s transformation into Hannibal Lecter. I would rather they imagine something else, something different. Safin is definitely the weakest link. Rami Malek is forced to do a dull old fashion villain. Bond is talking to M and they actually made fun of the new villain as having the same old evil plans. It would have been a lot simpler if Obruchev is the new villain. He played M and has his own kill list. His joke to Nomi about killing all the black people is more chilling and more memorable than anything yadayada evil plan from Safin. Safin\'s best scenes happen in the beginning without showing his face. It\'s a long movie and by hour three, the repetitive gun fire keeps droning on and on. It gets a bit tired. It would have helped by cutting out one villain and concentrating the screen time. This is the end Beautiful friend.', ""The first 20-25 minutes are superb (from the music to the location to the acting to the action), but then the titles fall (cool titles, bland song), and the movie never quite reaches those heights again.

He stars in this hilarious cop comedy. One of the funniest comedies of the 1980s and it still holds up.', 'Eddie Murphy\'s big hit ""Beverly Hills Cop"" is a funny and light film, brings a lot to the table: humor, action and a lot of differences between how Detroit works and how Beverly Hills works. Eddie Murphy was one of the big stars of the 80\'s and his career evolved with every movie and performance of his. This is probably one of his more notable movies. The film overall has much to offer, including those differences between Axel Foley and the other cops. The music is a little painful and overused but it does add the vibe of the 80\'s.', ""This film came out, Eddie Murphy's star was still rising and this pretty much was the pinnacle of his career.  This film is a funny, fast paced, action filled fun ride and Murphy really made the film an enjoyable experience.  Thank God that Sylvester Stallone backed out because I feel the film would have been a very dark intense film.  At least Murphy made Axel into a smart aleck who helped to lighten the mood of the film.  Also, the one underrated performance has to have been Judge Reinhold.  Reinhold makes an art of playing slightly goofy out of it characters and his portrayal of Detective Billy Rosewood was a perfect example of that and John Ashton was the perfect foil as Taggart.  This is definitely one of the top films of the 1980's"", ""Certainly one of the earliest examples of a proper cop-based action-comedy, 'Beverly Hills Cop (1984)' is a classic of its genre. With a fast-talking, freewheeling Eddie Murphy in its title role, the picture blends humour and adventure into one delightful little cocktail of one-liners, shoot-outs and bananas up tail-pipes. It just flies by, entertaining you pretty much every step of the way. The story itself isn't all that interesting (the audience is usually just waiting for the heroes to catch up with them) and it's also incredibly generic. However, the charisma of its characters keeps it from ever feeling stale. In general, its narrative shortcomings are easy to overlook. It's energetic and enjoyable right the way through. 7/10"", 'I\'ve Seen this movie over Twenty times and i know the scenes word for word.It showed that comedians could be thrown in serious roles,instead of just playing a clown or fool.It was good from start to finish.

MUST SEE FOR MURPHY FANS!!!', ""This was a lot of fun back in the day and holds up pretty well even now, as I watched it once again the other evening. For me it was one of those movies that remain memorable because of Eddie Murphy's nervous energy and brilliant wisecracks owing to some edgy script writing. My favorite scenes were the banana in the tailpipe, the strip joint take down of the two hoods, and while watching this time around, I happened to be eating a roast beef sandwich while being reminded by Detective Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) that by the time one hits fifty, you have about five pounds of undigested red meat in your colon. I'm a couple decades beyond that, so I probably have to compensate for another couple pounds or so.

Read all;"['A word of warning for those expecting another Gladiator or non stop action spectacle. It is not. Truly not...The bad: director Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes look slick and impressive (and he does an excellent job again), but he is also known for being quite average at making a drama. And this movie tries (and partly fails) to combine action and drama and somehow ends up being neither one. THAT is one of the reasons I\'ll only rate it with 6 stars.More bad: this story has a weak ""dramatic"" middle (love story) part, which is kinda tedious. And that brings me to a storyline complaint, namely that this story is all over the place. They cram SO much events and history and different characters from different time periods into this one movie that it kinda confused and numbed me down, instead of thrilling me, as an epic should do.This movie was made for Apple streaming (release date january 2024) in the first place, but they made a shorter (butchered) version for the cinemas in order to be able to compete for the Oscars, which demands that a movie must have run in the cinemas for a couple of weeks. No cinema version, no Oscars.The original Apple streaming version lasted some 2 hours longer. Nobody is gonna sit in the cinema for over 4 hours, hence they cut this movie up and now it feels somewhat rushed, confusing and disjointed at certain moments.Not any good then? Joaquin Phoenix is the one redeeming feature. He nails it.. He makes Napoleon look like a complete joke of a man and I love Joaquin Phoenix\' performance, but that unfortunately didnt compensate for the other actors being just about average and with little actor\'s chemistry between them.I had been warned beforehand by friends that this wasnt the spectacle or epic drama they were hoping for and unfortunately they were right. Certainly not a terrible movie, but one that is just about average.Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb.', ""The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure."", 'Many of Ridley Scott\'s movies are like visual masterpieces with epic storylines. I was sort of expecting something like Gladiator. Instead, it was just ""meh"" - I probably would have quit watching if it was on TV.Joaquin Phoenix has demonstrated that he can play odd or troubled characters well, but I don\'t think he was a good choice for Napoleon. He made the character seem more bizarre than charismatic or leader-like. I think the strongest and most interesting character was actually Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) ... who will probably get the most traction from the movie.The story itself wasn\'t that interesting because it wasn\'t explained that well. For example, his departure from Elba island seemed to randomly happen without much explanation. The elevation to a monarch-like role also happens without much explanation. It\'s like you\'re watching snippets of a bigger, more interesting story.I become so disconnected from the story that I almost fell asleep during some of the long battle sequences.The movie would probably have been better if it captured just one pivotal event or time period ... or better yet, if it had been a miniseries. While I will still look forward to any future movie from Scott, Napoleon deserved better.', ""I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I would take this over the Marvel materials from the past 3 years. Denzel's character is similar to the past but more economy of motion. I wish Dakota had more screen time. The scenes in Italy were lovely. I doubt we will see another one of these movies. This was an old school action thriller. The formula is pretty tried and true. I'm not sure how films have gotten away from what works. I hope all fans will turn out to see this film. My large theater was only 1/3 full but the weather was perfect on a Thursday early evening.Nice Job Anton, Dakota and Denzel."", ""Robert McCall, seriously wounded during operational activity, recuperates in the incredibly picturesque costal Italian town of Altamonte, a place where comes to feel he may find peace of mind. Two things happen while he is mending: he sends some intel he discovered during the op anonymously to his old organisation, and he realises that a group of mafia lowlifes are making things bad for local residents. These two threads intertwine.Denzel Washington's 3rd outing as McCall takes us to more exotic locations, gives another nasty slow build but, fear not, we get a fair amount of action norwithstanding our protagonist being out of commission for much of the action.I really like McCall. There is something very satisfying in seeing an enormously sympathetic and likeable character who is capable of turning on a sixpence, and doing what they do to violent, repellent people, only doing it better. And with a cold, matter-of-fact lack of emotion.There were a lot of moments I lked here, chief among them a shockingly well realised explosion, and an ending setting up McCall, recent victim of a severe woung, outnumbered against a powerful, well armed and organised foe. And a brief callback to the two previous films caught me by surprise."", ""This is by far the worst script of the trilogy.The story is 80% denzel on holiday in Amalfi coastal village where he sips tea, watches locals and dines out all day. And then at the end kills a few bad guys - but at some point in 3rd act he offers himself up but bad mafia guys decide not to end his life in front of the village people and end this miserable excuse of a movie. You almost wish they shot him to make it a tiny bit realistic and challenging.Oh and during his holiday which makes no sense at all and drags on like a slow Condé Nast tourist trip - it finally explains its lame story started because of some pensioner got hacked so he flew to recup 360k in cash and admits he does not even know the guy - huh?? Which feels more hollow than the shallow story - but let's not digress because the big reveal moment is the thinly written part of Dakota Fanning who asks did you pick me- duh - because she is daughter of his old boss. Really?This could have been revealed in 2nd act and made for a great story plot instead of 2 dimensional thin character that just acts like a teenager on holiday and definitely not CIA material - bad casting as Dakota best part is getting almost blown up. Good riddance but she survives.The entire film feels like a bad Charles Bronson movie from 70s and even the bad guys are pathetic characterization of the Italian Camora aka mafia.No idea how this film got such high ratings but by far the worst of the series and Denzel must have a Villa in Amalfi coast or family wanted a sweet holiday. Go in with super low expectations and you might enjoy the Italian scenery because there is not much equalizing - but loads of social dining. Maybe next film will include a Greek wedding4 stars to the food,fish, and tea - and Amalfi villages."", ""Don't get me wrong the movie was great! Even though Denzel Washington isn't the youngest any more his action scenes are brutal and just awesome to watch.The problem is that the movie has very few action scenes with Denzel and literally 20 minutes after his first real Purge against the bad guys we get to the final showdown, which doesn't feel like one, and then we are left feeling like we are still in the 2nd Act because a lot is still very unclear especially concerning the mafia.To see such a week ending/3rd Act after the amazing ending/3rd Act of the 2nd one is pretty disappointing, however balances the best opening from this trilogy which results in a good but nothing more movie."", ""Unfortunately.....this is not a continuation of the Equalizer series.....it's an excuse for the ending of it! The movie bogs down into a simple story of a small town.....terrorized by the mafia......and Denzel comes to the rescue. Some scenes make no sense.....the movie is 15-20 minutes too short....because the action scenes are too short. Seems instead of killing off a lead character.....they decided to retire the character into a small village situation with idyllic surroundings. That's fine......good for the retired......but not good for those looking for action and adventure.....little of which you get here!"", ""THE EQUALIZER (2023) *** Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Eugenio Mastrandrea, David Denman, Gaia Scodellaro, Remo Girone, Andrea Scarduzio, Andrea Dodero. The final chapter in the trilogy of the adaptation of the '80s tv series with Washington's Robert McCall attempting retirement in a Sicilian sleepy village where he finds the locals under the threat of the drug cartel led by Scarduzio which leads to a personal vendetta with copious bloodshed and retribution. Nice to see the MAN ON FIRE reunion of Washington and Fanning as a fed helping to snub out the gangsters. Washington is in fine form as the stil-waters-run-deep assassin whose dexterity never continues to surprise nor its ingenious gory outcomes. A fitting last dance (for now) directed with brio by Antoine Fuqua who helmed the series with aplomb."", ""Thank you Antoine fuqua for directing this exceptional trilogy. Every single is the perfect mix of emotion friendship evil and emotion. Equalizer 3 brings everything together seamlessly with absolute perfect ending. I literally had tears in my eyes. It was perfect. Thank you Denzel Washington as always you were perfect in every way possible. It's the perfect most extraordinary mix of good vs evil of any movie and trilogy I've ever seen. The violence is hardcore and bloody but the villains in this case the Camorra or Italian mafia are perfect bad guys for Robert McCall, the Equalizer. The location and cinematography are absolutely fantastic. The story is incredibly realistic. The supporting actors are great but at the end of the day it's all about Denzel and Antoine Bravo gentlemen for a sensational trilogy and for bringing bringing me personally such satisfaction."", ""All this third and final installment was, the same old story but in a different setting, with much less action, and a pointless walking cane that saw zero action. Washington carries the film and is impressive as always, but the writing was way more formulaic, cheesy, with lots of plot holes and ridiculous sub plots riddled with cliches. To make matters worse, Fuqua's choice to have the film set in beautiful Italy failed when most of the film needed English subtitles that took away from appreciating the Italian settings and landscapes, and the subtitles weren't on the screen long enough (not everyone is a speed reader) to make out what dialogue was being spoken in Italian. Technically, this was an Italian film with maybe 10% spoken English, and spending so much time reading subtitles took away from the entertainment value. Nevertheless, Denzel did what Denzel does and did it very well, and is the only reason to see this film."", 'It\'s been a while since I watched the first two Equalizers, but I remember them quite fondly as fun movies that found a nice balance between a simple yet effective story and brutal, well-made action scenes. So when I discovered that a third installmant was arriving soon, I was excited.Today, that excitement was shattered upon actually seeing the movie. The Equalizer 3 stars Denzel Washington, of course. And he is once again brilliant. The story here is that Denzel runs into an international drug trafficking ring by accident while trying to steal back his Uber driver\'s pension fund. The opening is amazing, showing off beautiful cinematography and a creative action sequence in true Equalizer style. Enjoy it while it lasts, because that\'s the last you\'ll see of that.After killing off a few mobsters, Denzel passes out by the side of the road and gets picked up by a random guy who just happens to be the son of a doctor who in turn just happens to like caring for random people with bullet wounds. Of course he is also called Enzo and he is an almost offensively stereotypical Italian. For the next hour or so, prepare to watch Denzel Washington drink tea. This movie contains more shots of Denzel drinking tea than it does of him firing a gun. In this little Italian town everyone loves Denzel for no apparent reason, to the point where random kids and grandmas walk up to him and give him gifts without even knowing him. There\'s a woman who basically throws herself at Washington from the second she sees him. Within a week, the people call him ""one of them"" and will literally die for him. It\'s just because he\'s American it seems, because he doesn\'t do much else. He watches the mafia terrorize the town and the people he apparently loves so much, but he doesn\'t actually get involved for weeks, not even when his favorite shop is burned to the ground.Meanwhile, there\'s a hesitant subplot where a CIA agent is investigating the drug trafficking ring. She comes to Italy but doesn\'t seem too bothered with investigating the actual criminals. She just hangs around harrassing Denzel, who is not even trying to hide that he\'s guilty of many murders at this point. She acts like she\'s this accomplished agent, but literally all she does is repeat Denzel\'s findings to her superiors and take the credit for them. She explodes somewhere halfway through the movie and they basically give her a promotion and a medal of honor for it.The mafia itself starts out quite menacing. They are well cast and very violent, but by the time Denzel finally starts killing them (over an hour into the movie) he immediately kills off all the good mobsters in an underwhelming 30 second shot. That\'s that then. Now all we have left is Victor, a stereotypical mob boss with not much character to him. He\'s just evil and he likes money and Ferraris. He is now real angry at Denzel for killing his brother and they have a standoff in the town square. It\'s quite cool and I was getting ready for an amazing shootout, but instead Victor just leaves to go eat spaghetti with his friends. I\'m not kidding. This mob boss, apparently the head of five huge crime families, then goes to take a nap with only a few bodyguards around even though he knows this masterful assassin is hunting him down.The final action scene mostly just killed my last bit of hope for this movie. The kills are dull and are just Denzel picking off guards with a knife one by one in pitch dark rooms. Victor barely puts up a fight and basically dies by getting hit by a Fiat Punto. That was it. The final Equalizer movie is now over and it contained maybe three minutes of actual Equalizing, most of which was incredibly boring. The cinematography is quite beautiful at times, the acting is great across the board, the Italian vibes are amazing and there\'s a few good and/or funny lines. But overall this movie was just an incredible letdown. I don\'t mind a slow buildup, but this doesn\'t build up to anything. The first half could\'ve been great if the second half had a proper payoff, but all Denzel does is drink more tea and kill maybe five people to bring down the entire Italian mafia. The romantic subplot that is set up gets no real conclusion, the ending suddenly introduces a weird plot point that was never mentioned before and then it ends abruptly.Not every action movie has to be John Wick with non-stop firepower, but I do expect there to be some actual action. The Equalizer 3 never really delivers. It\'s a very pretty display of the Amalfi coast and Denzel\'s acting, but that\'s about it. It\'s a shame.', 'Simply another movie about the Americans ""freeing"" another country. The film advanced the common narrative of ""Oh poor (insert country name) is so oppressed, please, almighty Americans, come and save it!"" It also exploits the scenic Italian countryside and urban centres to make up for its lack of storyline, meaningful dialogue, and a failed attempt at romance between Denzel and the Italian waitress. It\'s really not worth watching unless you want to watch the pitiful remnants of Denzel\'s once great acting career fizzle out on the screen before you. I really expected more from Fuqaua, this was a garbage-quality film.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"[""I've noticed quite a few reviews here from book fans complaining that the movie wasn't true to the novel. As a fan of the book, let me just say that's true but it's fine. The overarching story is the same. The fact of the matter is with a nearly 400 page novel packed full of pop culture references, some things would have to be cut to make it onto the big screen. Partially it's an issue of length. Partially it's just the reality that the planets were never going to fully align to allow use of many of the properties from the novel. Yes, I loved the 2112, WarGames, D&D, Joust, et al references from the novel as much as the next person, but still I felt that Spielberg captured the wonder and fun and the story of the novel accurately, even if he did so using different references. The are actually some things I even think were an improvement from the book, especially the way they re-imagined I-R0k. The bottom line is, if you're a book reader, just take this movie for what it is, an alternate version of the story, written by the same person who wrote the novel."", ""Pretty good movie visually and even though the changes from the book are obvious but they don't spoil it. They are changes that have to be made so it translates well on to screen. The comedy in the film is charming and not over the top. It fits in well with the film. The visuals are awesome. There are so many Easter eggs and references from pop culture it's unbelievable that they managed to add so many. It'll take a long time to spot them all. Overall I'd say this film is definitely worth a watch."", ""The book is better. It always will be. I think everyone knows that you cannot take a 15 hour book and condense it to a 130 minute movie without losing a lot of what made it special. Firstly there is no after-credit scene. So dont bother waiting. The opening title was just white text on a black screen, which is rather disapointing given the clever 'maze' logo all the marketing had.The film gets rid of the gates, most of the real world stuff, all the school stuff, and all character development. Our heroes just have all the weapons, cars, robots that they had to earn in the book. Even before finding the first key. Wade already owns the Delorian and Aech just happens to have Iron Giant in his garage. They make a number of dramatic changes to the main plot, some for visual storytelling (such as adding a car chase) and others to expand the role other characters worth in the plot, such as Art3mis going to IOI instead of Parzival. My main issue was the lack of character arcs. They all strated off strong, and ended the exact same way. The heart of the book was how this normal person rose from being one of us, to the savior of the universe. The film is missing that. Wade no-longer talks to the sweet old lady at the bottom of the stacks. He no-longer fixes people's old oasis machines, instead he steals there gloves? \nThose real world connections are lost and he just seems like a rich spoilt kid from the start. His reasons for not joining IOI are never explained. We as audinence members have no idea why he would not have taken the money. But on that, IOI are also made out to be idiots. They dont solve any puzzles or collect any of the keys. In the book they were far more competent. Then there is the whole rebellion side story which was not in book, hardly touched upon, was not explained, had unexplained henchmen, and ended abruptly. But the sheer fact that they had an army to fall back on in the real world weakened our connection to them for us as an audience. They were no longer the small guy going after the big corporation, now they were a small army going after what seemed to be just one man (Nolan) who was afraid of guns, and a mercenary woman who was beaten up by an eleven year old kid. The bad guys became a joke. Not to mention so stupid in that they keep there passwords written down for the world to see. The film captures the adventure and spectacle of the book thats for sure, but is missing its heart. And they shoehorned several side characters (Rick) into the movie which really could have been left out and there screen time devoted to more puzzle solving or building the relationship. They could have left i-Rok, Daito and Shoto out the story and it would not have changed anything. In fact, giving Nolan all of i-R0ks jobs would have helped his character. There is almost zero world building for the real world. They show pizza delivery drones that can fly around the city and place bombs on buildings, but somehow are unable to follow a giant delivery truck featuring the worlds most wanted down the road. Ignoring speed cameras and satellite tracking as well. Again, another example of incompetency the villains demonstrate. Perhaps I love the book so much, that its hard for me to separate the source material for this movie adaptation. But the book was not just about 80s nostalgia, it was about growth of characters as they went on this adventure together. It was about making sacrifices when needed and learning to work as a team to open the last gate. None of which was required for this movie. I also want to mention the lack of nostalgia music. The trailers had some great songs, with Pure imagination being outstanding. None of them however are played in the movie. With the exception of jump at the start, that felt out of place as it was too fast paced for someone just walking. Still watch it in the cinema as its an experience you have to see. But read the book, or listen to the great Will Wheaton audiobook as well, as its a very different story with more depth and love than the film portrays. I rate it 6.5 out of 10."", ""This movie surprised me. Wasn't expecting much other than the animation. For those who compare it to the book, it's a movie. If you are disappointed stick to reading. From start to finish the story was entertaining and kept you engaged. If you want to see something different with your family I highly recommend. Bring out the popcorn."", ""As a person who has not read the book, I find RPO a very entertaining movie. The CGI, comedy and pop-culture references are well designed for normal audiences.I don't understand where those 1 and 2 stars come from. Those condescending and raging comments are useless except showing you are a nerd. Get a life please."", 'The King of the Blockbuster is back! In the decade since reuniting with George Lucas and Harrison Ford for the shamefully underrated Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Steven Spielberg has tackled the heavy subjects of World War One, The Emancipation Proclamation, and the Cold War. With the exception of a couple of big budget duds (Tintin and the BFG), the man who practically invented the summer blockbuster had seemed to grow out of crowd-pleasing summer fun. Ready Player One isn\'t quite a summer movie, but it is in the great tradition of Spielberg Action Extravaganzas. Enormous, assured, and a whole Hell of a lot of fun, RP1 is the type of blockbuster that nobody else in Hollywood is even trying to make. An original script based on an original novel, visualized by a cinematic genius, and played without a constant, prying eye on the sequels, team-ups, and tie-ins... Marvel, eat your heart out.Ready Player One is based on the novel written by Earnest Cline, in which a young gamer, Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) attempts to complete the quest for the Ultimate Easter Egg. Within the virtual world of the OASIS, late creator James Halliday (Mark Rylance) has hidden three keys, which unlock the gate to the Egg, and gives the winner total control over the grandest virtual world ever conceived. Cline\'s novel had the potential to open itself up to limitless story possibilities. The imagination runs wild thinking of the spectacular challenges that might face Wade\'s avatar Parzival and his merry team of Egg Hunters (or Gunters), Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), Aech, Daito, and Sho. Cline totally squandered all the potential his premise had. Most of the challenges in the book revolve around playing dated video games (with a controller and TV) within the virtual world, and coasting through such fantastic movie worlds as War Games and Monty Python (sarcasm intended). The book is shockingly unimaginative in the way it plays in what is the world\'s biggest sandbox. A total rip-off!Thank God for Steven Spielberg. The man has more imagination in his little finger than Cline has in his whole body, and his movie capitalizes on the book\'s premise as fully as anyone could have hoped for.

Both Denzel Washington and Chloe Grace Moretz give stellar performances and display perfect chemistry as two friends stuck in a world of crime and violence. Arguably Fuqua's best film since 'Training Day', 'The Equalizer' is a brutal and merciless tale that explores the Russian underworld on the East Coast and the corruption ties within the law enforcement of Boston's police department."", 'At the end of it all, I found this movie very boring. The story is old as dirt. The plot is so obvious that as soon as characters appear on screen one can identify, ""He\'ll be killed,"" ""She\'ll be kidnapped and used as bait,"" ""Something bad\'s gonna happen to him,"" and my all-time favorite, ""He\'s the innocent, likable guy introduced early then ignored for 90 minutes (so we\'ll forget about him), only to have him turn up as a hostage in the big showdown."" And every prediction is spot-on.Example of bad writing: Two thugs walking up to a door. The last thing Thug 2 says to Thug 1 as they approach the door, ""Whatever you do, don\'t call him Little John."" Very next shot, inside the door, Thug 1 starts talking smack... and guess what he does? When the setup is literally 5 seconds earlier, we all see it coming.

An unusual relationship forms as she becomes his protégée and learns the assassin... Read all;"[""Leon (Jean Reno) is a tortured soul. He lives in squalor and misery, never truly happy or at peace with himself. After all, he is a hitman. He lives quietly from kill to kill, harming no-one whom he has not been paid to assassinate. He is a simplistic, childlike man who lives by his own set of morals but is troubled by them. The one thing he seems to fear above all else is change.Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is Leon's neighbour. A young girl, she lives with her father, step-mother, half-sister and half-brother. As unhappy as Leon, she lives in awe of the dark stranger, unaware of his true profession. Beaten by her parents and sister, she has abandoned school and instead spends the day watching cartoons and trying to escape from the real world.When Mathilda's family is brutally murdered by a drug crazed Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman), her only chance for survival is to hide with her neighbour. When she learns of Leon's true identity, she becomes infatuated with both him, and the grim world he inhabits.This stark portrayal of humanity and inhumanity is produced with the style and finesse that one expects from Luc Besson. In addition, the combined talents of Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman provide not only an unmatched on-screen chemistry, but also three perfectly created characterisations, the like of which are rarely seen in today's cinema. This film has my personal recommendation of being the best piece of cinema that I know of. I have not seen anything that matches it in terms of intensity or emotion - and believe me, I've looked. I found myself caring for the characters involved, an unique experience in itself.  This is not the type of film for a night in with your mates, but nevertheless, it is an unforgettable piece of cinematic history."", ""This film was absolutely amazing.  I have spent hours re-watching various scenes and noticing all the perfection with which they are acted and directed.  It's not the violence or action sequences that make this movie so great (although they are well done...), but rather moments like where Mathilda knocks on Leon's door.  It would be so easy to just film the door opening, but instead we see light illuminating Natalie Portman's face, symbolizing something angelic.  And the moment has so much more meaning.I know a lot of people who have seen this film because they are action fans. I'm not.  But I'm glad I finally found it, because it's a wonderful film in so many other ways."", ""With enough blood and gore to please any fan of action movies, and a unique love story to please the ladies, this is a great movie for couples to watch together. However, to truly comprehend the beauty of this film, you must see the European Cut.The U.S. version is still a great movie, but it cuts out 24 minutes which contain much of the heart of the movie and most of what makes the film a work of art instead of the usual action fodder. Elements of the story which are only hinted at in the U.S. cut become the centerpiece of the story when the un-cut version is seen.The two main characters are a recently-orphaned girl who is wise beyond her years and a hitman who is still an innocent. Their relationship unfolds against a backdrop of murder and revenge as director Luc Besson explores issues of age and maturity, good and evil, and the interplay of life, death and love.The acting in this film is superb. Reno has an expressive face which conveys a myriad of emotions with great sensitivity and few words. He is cold as ice as the almost super-human 'professional', but his performance is most moving when he reveals his sensitive side. Watching as his wounded soul slowly begins to heal is enough to touch the heart of any woman, but it is handled so subtly that it never becomes too 'sappy'.In her film debut, Natalie Portman turns in a performance that is beautiful beyond belief. She manages the transition from a  frightened child to a woman capable of killing so convincingly that it makes the relationship between she and Leon not only believable, but understandable.Gary Oldman is just the best psycho there is, and it is kind of nice to see him without all the strange makeup for a change. As a dirty cop in this film he personifies evil, and it is a joy to watch him do his thing.The special effects are all you could hope for. Besson does great actions scenes - especially the explosions. There is also a lot of humor and when you throw in the tender love story -  this picture has it all!"", 'Luc Besson\'s ""The Professional"" is sort of a companion piece to his international breakthrough hit ""La Femme Nikiti"", and in many ways it\'s an even better film. It raises the stakes of Besson\'s playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won\'t leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of ""The Professional"" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other.', 'Rating: 6.8The themes they were trying to convey about love, and maturity (Matilda was a child forced to grow up, and Leon an adult who never truly ""matured"" they helped each other) was completely drowned out by the overwhelming creepiness between the relationship of a grown man and 12-year-old girl. Natalie Portman was grossly sexualized in this, we had scenes of her wearing lingerie, calling Leon her lover, telling Leon she\'s in love with him, and waking up in the same bed as Leon which is shot like you\'re typical ""morning after"" scene. While Leon never advances on her confused romantic love, it shouldn\'t even be in here as it adulterates their supposed father-daughter relationship. Some of the action sequences were ridiculous: ex Leon getting blown up and then changing into an officer\'s uniform in less than 10 seconds. And the villain was just a one-note psychopath for no reason (why was he eating those pills? How did this man become a drug enforcer? Why is he so unhinged?)It turns out the writer was dating a 15 yr old girl at 29 years old during this and it just shows through his work.', 'This film, better known in the U.S. as ""The Professional"", is a wonderful and intense film. Jean Reno plays his role as a ""cleaner"" with incredible subtlety. Leon tries to keep his emotions completely suppressed, yet Matilda (in an extraordinary performance by a young Natalie Portman, who is destined to become a very powerful actress into her adult life) bring out in him a new-found joy for life that accompanies his growing paternal instincts. But, the most dynamic element of this film is undeniably Gary Oldman\'s performance as a wildly sadistic and crooked DEA agent with his own narcotic-induced demons. His obsessions eventually lead him to the brink of absolute madness in his hunt for the cleaner. Truly, this is Oldman\'s finest performance to date, worthy of Oscar glory, though sadly forgotten. And so, Luc Besson did indeed top his triumph of ""La Femme Nikita"" by far with this masterpiece. Though, I cannot exactly praise his most recent effort with the sci-fi misfire, ""The Fifth Element.""', ""Despite having a mainly American cast and being set on the rough streets of New York, this is very much a French film, evident from the crew list at the end of the film. I'm always one to give foreign film-makers a try, as they usually offer up something a little bit more stylish and different than the usual formula. Take Lucio Fulci with his trademark 'hard' and nightmarish horror films, Dario Argento with his gory yet stylistic giallo films, or John Woo's violent, ballet-like action films.Luc Besson doesn't disappoint with this film, offering us his typical lashings of wit, and drawing charisma and charm from his cast. While THE FIFTH ELEMENT bordered on being silly in places, it was still a fun science fiction film, and kudos to the man for experimenting with different genres. LEON is probably the first film that brought him to the typical American's attention, and I would say deservedly so. While masquerading as a typical action-filled gun fest, it is in fact a film of three parts. The beginning is packed with horrible, unflinching violence from killers who don't have the slightest feeling of remorse - Jean Reno expertly massacres a squad of bodyguards, while Gary Oldman shotguns children and people in the bath. The middle of the film is more like a conventional drama, and it tells the story of Leon, the hit-man, and Mathilda, the young orphaned victim, and their growing love for one another which draws the human side of Leon out of his impassive shell. The ending is indeed all out action.All parts of the film are great, and Besson frequently shows his American contemporaries how it should be done. As the box says, it is extremely hard-hitting at the beginning, with deaths shown in all their bloody impact. The ending is also brilliant, with a SWAT team laying siege to Leon's apartment";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A man comes back to life to serve vigilante justice on the men who raped and murdered his fiancé (and threw him out a window). Vengeance is served with gruesome takedowns and poetic justice as the crow and his walking corpse tear up the town. The cinematography is actually kind of beautiful its dark and ominous tone. The storyline flows well and the characters well developed. A killer Halloween tale.', 'Nearly 25 years ago the only son of Bruce Lees final film came out and became a sensation and changed the way comic book movies were aimed at mature audiences. The alt rock soundtrack along with an epic score by Graham revell that has been used for trailers for movies such as pearl harbor makes this movie a must own.', ""I approached this film after reading the hype and controversy surrounding its making and release, not really expecting very much.  Surprised to find it an intelligent, beautifully-filmed, engrossing and touching thriller. I'd recommend it to anyone who has a fondness for weird gothic mythological stories.  I didn't find the horror aspect overdone - in fact it was believable, and the script was superior to other films of this genre I've seen.  As for Brandon Lee, this really was a superb performance and it is a terrible tragedy that his life ended so abruptly.  This film is a fitting memorial to what could have become a major star."", 'This movie is fantastic. plain and simple. Brandon Lee delivers his lines to the point they were instantly memorable after seeing the film only once. The casting of both Michael Wincott and Tony Todd was inspired as these two guys have two of the most instantly recognisable voices in the movie industry. If i could ever be a movie or a lead in a film this would be it. I was initially put off the idea of the movie as i am a big fan of the graphic novel and there was an awful lot of hype around this film on its release. this proved to be my loss as i have only seen the film on the small screen. however i now have the 2 disc special edition DVD and watched it 3 times in succession the day i bought it and must have watched it at least 100 times since. my own personal opinion is that a movie should suspend disbelief, capture the imagination which this does in spades. it is truly a film that you can lose a couple of hours watching and at the end feel like you have spent a worthwhile couple of hours. would recommend this to anybody.', 'The only thing i can say is that when i left the movie theater then i had no comment to give... This movie got to me deep! I was 14 and now i am 25,and still i remember it so well and i still watch it sometimes.. Brandon Lee did a great job as an actor like everyone else, but the story about his death is totally insane, which made me worship the movie even more. What an irony. I like the movie cause it\'s dark, but also lighted up with true emotions..there is action, horror, love, even poetry for god sake! I have never seen so many genre\'s in one movie. Anyway for me it has been one of the best movies i have ever watched. And one more comment, lots of of other movies got ideas from The Crow, meaning the setting, the action, music, whatever it is the crow was their start up. I am not going to name them, Crow fans probably know what i am talking about.. My favorite quote: ""Can\'t rain all the time"" By the way the soundtrack\'s are awesome, The Cure\'s best song ever made is in it! P.S. The Crow II and III sucked, i hated it. They just ruined the conception of the first one.. totally..', 'James O\'Barr created The Crow as a way to deal with the death of his fiancee at the hands of a drunk driver. Today, we may know it more for the death of its lead actor Brandon Lee. Take it from someone who was 22 when the original film came out and had already been a fan of the comic - it was the perfect movie for its time, a capsule ready made to be looked back on as I am now old and have so many memories around this time.Eric Draven (Lee) has been killed after trying to save the life of his fiancee, Shelley. One year later, a crow brings him back to life as he unleashes terror on the gang of Top Dollar (Michael Wincott, Strange Days).It\'s an incredibly simple tale of revenge, but the gothic look and soundtrack that reflects the time of its creation drive this movie beyond its simple origins. I remember being beyond excited when My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult was actually in the film, playing at Top Dollar\'s club before his gang heads out to set Detroit ablaze on Devil\'s Night.Of course, there has long been discussion of the film being cursed. In addition to the accident where Michael Massee shot a live round - unbeknownst to the actor - a carpenter suffered serious burns, another worker was stabbed in the hand by a screwdriver, an equipment truck blew up, a stuntman broke his ribs, a rigger was electrocuted, a set sculptor flipped out and drove his car through the prop room and finally, a hurricane destroyed much of the set.Another reason for so much of this - beyond fate - was that there was plenty of cost and corner cutting, with a crew member remarking that they were ""trying to make a $30 million movie for $18 million."" As the movie was being shot in North Carolina, which is a right-to-work state, the unionized conditions of Hollywood did not exist. They switched schedules from night to day without the industry standard 24-hour break. Rumors of rampant cocaine use on set also exist.Due to Lee dying, many of the scenes had to be reshot with a double and CGI. All of the scenes with Michael Berryman\'s Skull Cowboy character had to be cut, too.Despite the tragic nature of its creation, The Crow remains a movie that reminds me of a different time in my life. Its influence on culture remains.', 'R. I. P. Brandon Lee\nIt was an interesting and different movie. It has a different atmosphere.He looked like Joker. Their music was also great.', ""The crow is a 1994 supernatural superhero film based on the comic book series of the same name about a musician who is resurrected from the dead to seek vengeance against the gang who murdered him and his fiancée.This is a great film with some horribly sad history for the fact that Brandon Lee was killed while making it. But as a whole, it's one of the absolute best movies from the early 1990's. It's a dark story in its subject matter, but so well done you can't take your eyes off of the screen. Brandon Lee's performance is captivating and grabs your attention never letting go until the end. The way it was shot is visually stunning, and it's definitely a movie you'll want to see more than once.If you have never seen The Crow before, I would highly recommend giving it a watch."", ""I never had a goth phase growing up and I can't stand The Cure, but god help me, I love a good revenge flick.

This movie is wonderfully inventive, beautifully shot, and totally unlike anything else I've ever seen before. Plus, you get to see Nick Cage fight with chainsaws. What's not to like?"", ""If you think killing John Wick's dog is dangerous wait until you see what happens when you rip Nic Cage's favorite shirt."", 'Just a brief review here summed up in two words...Absolutely Mental.', ""This movie is an absolute trip and people complain about style over substance but that's the whole point of the movie. To give us an insane heavy metal LSD horror trip for 2 hours. It suceeds in every way. Nic Cage is goofy in this movie and it is perfect. Some of his expressions are golden.I mean if you liked the new suspiria or the neon demon or climax it's kinda in this genre."", 'First half of the movie: 6.5/10\nSecond half - 2/10Okay, first things first - visually it\'s not bad, if you ignore the abuse of the color correction in some places, there\'s some interesting things about camera work and such, but all of it falls flat after the first hour of the movie, because everything else takes a nosedive into the pool of excrement.All the build-up and suspense in the first hour of the movie is completely gone in the second half, when the ""action"" comes in.When members of the cult are first introduced, you can feel that they are a threat. The first appearance of these cenobite-like bikers is good - you don\'t know anything about them, their identity is completely mystified and they feel like something inhumane, demonic.Guess what? Nope, they are just a bunch of drug-addicted douchebags, and they are killed by main character in a very lame manner in about 15 minutes of screentime.Same goes for all other cult members - turns out there\'s just small bunch of them, and, by some lucky coincidence, they are completely separated from each other, so they can be easily killed by Nicholas Cage in the most lazy and uninspiring ways.Have i told you that action scenes are bad? Oh boy, they are. There\'s two ways in which main character kills someone - it\'s either some quick cheap death made possible by pure luck and stupidity of the victim, or badly choreographed cringe-inducing attempt at making a fight scene.Here\'s some example: there\'s a very long camera shot of the guy polishing his car, there\'s nobody around and he\'s completely unaware. Suddenly, it cuts to a looped video of the rotating axe at pitch black background. Next shot just shows the guy silhouette falling with the axe in his head and that\'s it - it looks like something straight out of Troma movie.Given that story is non-existent, and it\'s only there to accompany the visuals, you at least expect the ""revenge"" part to be satisfying and over the top, especially if you watched the trailer. But unfortunately it turns out to be a boring slog, with an anticlimactic ending and feeling of dissatisfaction.', ""Mandy is a visually gorgeous film that's like no other film. Panos Cosmatos' direction is incredible and the action sequences are great. Nicolas Cage gives an incredibly committed performance that's both emotional and unhinged when required. Andrea Riseborough and Linus Roache both give great supporting performances. The music by Johann Johannsson is fantastic."", ""Take away the camera filters and lens flares and you are left with an unoriginal revenge film for which there are many better, there's far too many unnecessary slow-motion shots which stretch the thin plot out unbearably to over 2 hours. Critics seem to be lapping it up for its style but I need more then that."", ""You have to be on a bad acid trip in order to get anything good out of this crappy low budget movie.\nHow can anyone give it a high rating? After suffering through 2 hours totally waste of time, I understand why no one of those who gives it a high rating are able to come up with an actual review of it. It's the worst and most boring movie I have seen the last 10 years. DISSAPOINTING!"", 'This really is not for everyone and that is just fine.\nAlso story wasnt anything new or special, just typical revenge story.\nReally liked how this looked, sounded and felt.\nVisuals and colours are just outstanding and that was something that hooked me from the start, really trippy stuff in a good way.\nMusic and sounds were pushing this dark overall sinister feel and worked perfectly.\nAnd also Nick have us great performance near insanity.', 'Mandy is the latest indie darling/art-house horror/Nic Cage film that is setting the internet ablaze and movie critics reaching for the hyperbolic adjectives. It\'s almost the perfect film for the current generation of movie goers: it\'s arty enough for the critics, hip enough for the nonchalant, above-everything crowd, gory and violent enough for the hardcore genre fans and it stars Nic Cage so even the ""oh my god he\'s just so crazy"", ""so-bad-it\'s-good"" meme makers are happy. Mandy tells the story of loving couple Red Miller and Mandy Bloom. Living in the Pacific north west in 1983, Red (Cage) works as a forestry worker while Mandy (Riseborough) is an artist and works in a local shop. Their idyllic, private and quiet life is soon torn asunder, in a vile and brutal way, by a drugged up, hippy, religious cult, accompanied by three insane bikers. Cage then goes all mental and revengy on them, having borrowed a cross bow from a random cameoing Bill Duke and forging his own, both futuristic and ancient, scythe/sword thing.From there it gets violent, bloody and darkly comic and features a recurring tiger motif, genre homages a plenty and a legitimately groovy chainsaw fight. So let\'s get into it then. I like Nicolas Cage as an actor. Not in an ironic way, not in an aloof way but just in a genuine way. Does he occasionally over act and does he ever give strange line readings? Yes - see almost any decent actor out there. Actors can become personalities, parodies of themselves and while that might improve their brand, it tarnishes their talent. Will you be a Christopher Walken and acknowledge it but just continue doing what you\'ve always done or will you be a Jeff Goldblum and go full maximum Goldblum, letting it define you? Well I think Cage is sticking on he Walken side of that equation.He does too many movies and the roles are too diverse for you to ever pigeonhole the Cage method. Contrary to popular belief he is not an Eric Roberts, taking any single film idea offered to him. When you look through his filmography and actually watch a few of the films (as opposed to just ironically watching The Wicker Man remake stoned and laughing or sharing memes of his hair in Bangkok Dangerous) you\'ll find an actor in the enviable position of working in whatever genre likes, telling weird and wonderful stories and having tremendous fun into the bargain. He\'s not beholden to Hollywood narrow-mindedness or to fan pressure to just keep doing one type of thing. Not many people in the business can claim that. \n \nWhen it comes to Mandy, also consider these two bits of information:\nCage was offered the role of the manic, charismatic and egotistical preacher Jeremiah Sand (Linus Roache). This is the obvious Cage role, in a movie with barely any dialogue, Jeremiah has all the pontificating, grandstanding and mood-swinging we\'ve seen Cage do previously. Cage instead pushed to get the role of Red Miller, a role that director Panos Cosmatos intended for a much younger actor. Now, Red Miller has his moments and there is definitely a drizzling of unhinged Cage in the film but the role is also defined by its silence and by its screams, not its dialogue or its mania. I have heard reviews single out a bathroom sequence, where he drinks vodka while in unimaginable pain, as Cage doing his ""thing"". I didn\'t find the sequence ""classic weird Cage"", I actually found it understandable, moving and disturbing. The film really hinges on us following his journey both emotionally and physically. Like a silent film, Mandy relies on its visuals and action to tell its, relatively, limited story and allows for audience interpretation and extrapolation. If Nic Cage\'s performance doesn\'t work, if you\'re not gripped by his plight and pushed forward by his determination for retribution then none of it really works.The second bit of information is that during an interview with filmmaker Kevin Smith, Nic Cage admitted not only to watching Panos Cosmatos\' previous film Beyond the Black Rainbow but to watching Kevin Smith\'s ""walrus movie"" Tusk. No one mentions the ""walrus movie"" in an interview unless they\'ve actually seen it. Smith was talking about Valley Girl, if Cage wanted to simply repay the compliment he\'d say Chasing Amy, Clerks or something he might have watched at a film festival once. No, Cage dropped Tusk, that tells me a lot about Nicolas Cage.Andrea Riseborough as Mandy says only a few things in the movie and, spoilers (not-really), the plot involves her exiting the film early on. What we can ascertain, however, is that she is peaceful, detached, likes art, fantasy novels, 80s metal, sci-fi films (more on that later) and living out in the middle of nowhere. An unexplained scar on her face and her quiet removal from society indicates maybe some past trauma but that is never developed upon. More than anyone else in the film, her character\'s apparent passions and taste define the influences on the film. The strong, deep, vivid colour palette of the cinematography, the cinematic references, the metal album cover references, the designs of the bikers and even a few animated sequences all seem to flow from what we see of Mandy Bloom during act one of the film.The other cast member that definitely deserves a mention is Linus Roach as Jeremiah Sands. While no clear philosophy or message comes through his babbling preacher and variety of messed up followers - a hodge podge of crazies, true believers and lost and damaged souls - Sands is a frustrated musician, ego maniacal lunatic, mood swinging abuser and deluded psychopath. On the surface he\'s just an amalgam of any other clichéd cult leader but, as previously stated, Mandy is short on exposition but shows you just enough of any character that you can extrapolate most of what is trying to be portrayed. The true genius moment of his character is when he puts on his record, hoping that his drippy, psychedelic, pastiche folk stylings will impress Riseborough\'s Mandy. For those in the know about music and cult leader cliches it is a belly laugh moment.Panos Cosmatos definitely wrote and made this film for people who have seen films like this before but who, probably, haven\'t seen one presented like this before. In other words he trusts a savvy audience to fill in some of the blanks. I think the artistic sheen on the movie, and clearly very deft cinematic skill with which it\'s constructed may push some to believe the film is deep in someway but, don\'t be fooled, this film is an exploitation film pure and simple. Just because they skimped on character and plot explanations, shot it with a bunch of lights and filters, scored it with tension building rumbles and high, unnerving synth tones and left wide gaps for the audience to fill in doesn\'t mean there\'s some hidden message or explanation there. It just means Panos Cosmatos knows how to construct a good genre film. He knows that in most horror, action and/or exploitation films you point the audience at a bad guy, put the good guy through hell and with that justify the carnage filled journey of our anti-hero for the remaining 70 minutes.I\'m sure there are reasons for some of the tiger imagery and some of the vaguries in the film but its driving force is exploitation, cool moments, grusome kills, mad weaponry, Argento style lighting, movie references all over the shop and hip t-shirts.An easy criticism would be to say it is style over substance and it is, it\'s glorious, arresting, eerie, difficult, dark, disturbing, mad, violent, deeply coloured and surreal style over substance.There was one scene, however, that sold the whole film to me and made me love it unequivocally - what are you talking about Jon? The chainsaw fight? are you talking about the chainsaw fight because that scene is off the chain! - No, I am not talking about the epic chainsaw battle, although that scene is, indeed, off the chain. I am talking about a sequence that\'ll probably mean very little to a lot of people but allow me to explain why the Nightbeast scene in Mandy is EVERYTHING.During the opening 15 minutes of the movie as we meet Mandy and Red, see their life together, there is a sequence where the two of them watch a sci-fi B Movie together. They eat TV dinners, at separate tables and do not take their eyes off the TV screen. A TV Screen which is showing Don Dohler\'s Nightbeast.Don Dohler is the Baltimore native filmmaker who made alien invasion movies, mad horror/action films, straight-to-video slashers and naughty vampire films in the quiet suburbs, at the end of a nondescript cul-de-sac, in Maryland.Unfortunately, in this age of snarky \'so-bad-it\'s-good\' film fandom, some of Don\'s films have been either derisively enjoyed or simply dismissed by some people. This is a crushing shame because when you look passed their limited budgets and occasional amateur moments, you find a passionate, creative, inventive, weird, gonzo and original series of homemade masterpieces from a person who followed his dream. He should be an inspiration to the backyard John Carpenters and basement Hitchcocks of today - in fact in his home town of Baltimore he has been and indie filmmaking thrives there. This is why the scene in Mandy where Nic Cage and Andrea Riseborough sit so seriously and intently glued to Nightbeast is the best scene in the film. They don\'t laugh, they don\'t mock it, they are genuinely into it and this tells us b-movie fans all we need to know about their relationship. I am the first to admit that low budget filmmaking is not for everyone but when you find that person who will, un-cynically, watch a Don Dohler film (or similar) with you, then you have found true love and a soulmate. When I saw that scene, I understood the film. In lesser hands the couple would\'ve watched The Room and laughed at it in an ugly, derisive way and I would\'ve hated it....', ""There's some good stuff here, but there's a lot that's complete trash. Shots are needlessly long and there's literally twenty completely unnecessary scenes. It took over an hour to progress the story to any level of interest. It's a shame because there's such potential here."", ""I thought I had seen it all when it comes to movies with Nick Cage in them. The good, the bad, the ultrabad... I was wrong: I was missing the crazy.\nThis not really a story that we're seeing unfold there. t is, rather, a psychedelic trip the director had after snorting the ashes of an incinerated abomination, cremated right after a female cenobite gave birth to it during a shroom-induced seizure. The locations exist in two flavours only: surreal or mundane. Nothing is done to explain Nick's weapon of choice, there are weird bits of cartoon scattered all around the piece... the only thingthis vaguely reminds me of is the spirit that reigned in Metal Hurlant, only much darker in tone. And for such a paroxystic piece, it's a very slow burner, so you'll never know where you stand with the pace or the plot.\nThat movi is made to be analyzed by cinema students and psychiatry interns. It's certainly not mùeant for the average moviegoer looking for a good time."", ""Nicolas Cage is very well known for going all out. There are memes out there depicting this. And you would be excused for thinking he is like that in real life. But if you watch his interviews you realize he is different. Soft spoken and so different from what he portrays. Seems like he gets it out of his system, when he plays those characters.But back to the movie, that will split people and their perception of it (someone wrote a review saying that you'll either love it or hate - half the people agree and ... well you get the point). The coloring is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing too. And the movie is ultra violent and quite vivid when it comes to the depiction of it. Not for the squeamish then ... And quite crazy overall"", 'Opening with a song by King Crimson, filmmaker Panos Cosmatos\' surreal, insane horror film ""Mandy"" is another of those films that will only appeal to certain tastes. It tells of a happy couple, Red and Mandy (Nicolas Cage and Andrea Riseborough), whose peaceful existence is shattered by an evil hippie cult.

SPOILER ALERT It\'s a given that being in debt to a crime boss means your debt will never really be cleared, so that\'s okay for a movie.And you can suspend disbelief for driving physics and non-deploying airbags...But...Doc sending the third crew to meet with arms dealers was totally unnecessary for the job they had the next day, because they already had all the equipment they needed, so that whole scene was forced just for a plot device.Bats proved he was willing to kill for no reason, so there\'s really no reason he would have left Joe alive.There is no way Buddy would have been able to escape all those cops swarming him downtown. Then Buddy shows up again later after getting shot in the chest. Superhuman villains in a non-superhero movie tend to ruin the whole thing.Doc remaining in the place from where the heist was launched at risk of being caught for no reason (even though he knew it was botched) made no sense, just like his sudden change of heart in ""helping"" Baby made no sense.Oh and Jon Bernthal is only in the movie for about 10 minutes, so not sure why he was given top billing, when he\'s pretty much just an extra with a couple of lines. Baby\'s deaf foster dad had more lines (sign language) than Bernthal, yet he\'s not considered a main character.', 'I thought I would be tracking for at least an 8 or 9, and ended up w/ a 6 or 7, maybe 6.5 rounded to 7 as the last 30 or 40 minutes of the film had a lot of unbelievable scenes w/ one of the bad guys continually defying arrest and death and continuing to pop up like a bad nightmare. Also, as others have noted, the girl seemed to fall very / too quick for Baby Driver, and is fine w/ Baby going to prison.', 'Overall not a bad film as a whole but unfortunately there are just a few bits that grind my gears, pun intended.First of all a lot of plot holes including right near the end when \'spoiler alert\' buddy takes baby\'s hearing from him before attempting to kill him. - What is the purpose of this if his intent is to kill him anyway - id understand if he was to deafen him then leave sure you\'ve taken something away from him but to deafen him and then try to kill him literally seconds later?? Secondly, the big reveal of the Mustang or Camaro at the end to then destroy it in the next scene - whats the point if it was supposed to be ""the car to drive off and listen to music in"" There are so many that I could go on beyond the character limit on this page but without being finicky the movie isn\'t terrible', ""Baby...Oh Baby...Baby Driver is one of the coolest,smartest and greatest films I've seen in years.It's fast-paced, well-acted,with beautiful cinematography and an outstanding soundtrack.Ansel Elgort's performance is great and all the other actors like Kevin Spacey,Jammie Fox and John Hamn were satisfying. The movie is also one of the best choreographed films I've ever seen.Every single move of the characters is combined with music and after a point I understood that without the music,this heist movie wouldn't work.An example of perfect connection of the music with the scenes is when Baddie,Darling and Bats shoot at some people and all this shooting coming form their guns creates..music. Edgar Wright's direction was phenomenal because, in my opinion, he found a perfect balance of style and substance.The car chase scenes,especially the first one,are perfectly directed and show that without a doubt Edgar Wright is one of the best director's working today. All in all,Baby Driver is a fun,cool and ambitious ride with lots of twists and turns and a perfect combination of what we love most: Cars and Music After Baby Driver my mind is only thinking of one thing Just me,music and the road"", '""Baby Driver"" is a sort of ""Drive"" wannabe with the story of an intriguing runaway driver However the messy genre of action, romance, crime, music, drama and comedy associated to an awfully moralist conclusion spoil what could have been a cult-movie.

I wasn\'t writing these reviews when this movie first came out, didn\'t even know there was such a thing as IMDb. So I\'m finally getting back to it this many years later and even though I\'d forgotten a lot about the story, I was blown away all over again by the outrageous antics of Captain Jack Sparrow and those transition scenes where the skeleton pirates manifest in the moonlight. In fact, the story itself might be incidental to the special effects and physical stunts that highlight the action in the film. Johnny Depp of course makes the movie with his swish-buckling (yeah, I misspelled it on purpose) approach to the character, and you couldn\'t ask for a more fetching lady in distress than Keira Knightley, although she managed to hold her own against most of those menacing pirates quite nicely. Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush round out the rest of the principal cast, and each did a superb job. I\'ve never gotten beyond this movie\'s sequel, \'Dead Man\'s Chest\', but watching this one again inspires me to go forward and check out all the rest.', 'What a great line to describe probably the greatest pirate movie ever. Certainly, it isn\'t perfect, a bit over the top, yet filled with characters that you love to hate or you can\'t resist rooting for. Thanks to the performance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, this has become a long-lasting franchise of Disney car and love the many sequels that followed up aren\'t as good, Jack has remained consistently strong in the ones where he was given a great opportunity to show off his huge talents.Johnny was justifiably nominated for an Oscar for his performance in this, and is ably supported by Geoffrey Rush as the ghostly Captain Barbarossa and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner (brought up as a pirate until he was rescued at sea as a child), and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of the governor of a Caribbean island.In his performance, Depp gives several insights into the real character of Jack Sparrow, and it is debated whether he was just an eccentric drunk or possibly gay or bisexual. Certainly, the slaps he gets from various women throughout the film debate the second point, but other insinuations indicate that he had prolactivities. Sparrow and Turner are rivals at first until they must join forces to rescue Elizabeth who is kidnapped by Barbarossa. she goes to a frightening sequence when she learns of who they really are, and that brings terrific elements of horror into the film.Fans of the Disneyland ride will be gleefully surprised to see various elements of it from the drunk man sleeping with tags, the jailed men trying to get a dog to bring over the key or the various battle fights at sea. they are spread throughout the film so you don\'t feel like you taking the ride and then gone back into a plot, so it makes it fun for experienced riders of that tourist attraction as they pop up.The terrific makeup, costumes, photography and music add to the sensational performances. This takes the best elements of all the classic pirate movies (from ""Treasure Island"" to ""Captain Kidd"") and adds a reality with the violence and filth and crudeness, but somehow, some of the pirates (especially Sparrow) are quite loveable in a strange way. This is non-stop action, filled with humor both physical and verbal, and some of it in spite of the lack of etiquette of the characters is subtlety classy. I can see myself returning to this every couple of years because certainly, like a trip to Disney, it\'s a ride that you don\'t want to miss when you have the opportunity.', ""Yep, 20 years late with a review. But give me a break, i was a kid back then.\nAnyways this movie is amazing. It is original, full of twists and turns, fun, funny... It deserves 9 stars. However considering the fact i had to lower criteria for 'modern' movies made in the past decade, i have to give this a maxumum rating because compared to them it should get 15/10 stars."", ""Awesome action and swashbuckling adventure, great music from the likes of Hans Zimmer, good visuals and Johnny Depp's hilarious improvisational performance as Captain Jack Sparrow (the other performances are good as well but Depp's the highlight and you damn well know it) make the first Pirates of the Caribbean adventure a fun action flick that's not only a great first non-Touchstone/Hollywood Pictures/pre-2006 Miramax & Dimension PG-13 Disney movie but also a much better movie than a movie based off of a THEME PARK RIDE has the right to be."", 'I just forgot how many times I watched this film.This film has comedy,adventure,action.The climax was awesome.A must watch movie.', 'This film is the epitome of a solid action-filled adventure.

I don´t want to say it's bad or stupid, it's just...like a floppy, disposable, toy. As an adult, I felt a waste of time sitting down and trying to watch this kind of material, even with one of my kids besides me, enjoying it. Saying this, if you take this movie seriously you can point out the following: 1. It lacks of historical accuracy or even the remotest realism (pirates were bandits blessed by the Queen who used to attack Spanish vessels, I guess, or someone told me that). 2. All the characters are caricatures from a comic strip 3. The plot is 0, nil, nought, zero. 3. The formula: Maximum adventure with Minimum suspense (poor Hitch!) 5. Avalanche of FX to keep the children amused. 6. No dialogs, no conflicts, no real life. But, who wants these things today?"", 'When the daughter of the governor of a Caribbean island, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), is proposed by Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), she faints, fells into the sea and is rescued and saved by the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) but he is arrested and sentenced to death for piracy. Meanwhile, the town is attacked by the ship Black Pearl, commanded by the former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who leaded a mutiny against Captain Jack Sparrow years ago. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth, and the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who loves her, releases Jack Sparrow and they steal the fastest vessel of the navy to follow the Black Pearl, Will trying to save Elizabeth, and Jack trying to retrieve his ship. Along their journey, many secrets are disclosed about the course of the Black Pearl and her crew.The supernatural adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Barbossa are so spectacular that really deserves to be included among the best movies (Top 250) in IMDb. This film has action, humor, romance, mystery, special effects and is so delightful that the viewer does not feel the running time of 143 minutes.

Roger Deakins is an absolute maestro. Music and sound combo of the movie added to the tension. Johann Johannsson's score is another exciting driving force upon which the film is carried. It was powerful. Incredible action-thriller. It was extremely dark. Not color wise, but the subject matter. Villeneuve really knows how to take the most vile subjects and turn them into intense n dark cinema. The acting was top notch especially Del Toro. He is comfortable with this sort of material and it really shows. I hav always been a fan of Brolin after no country for old men. His character was so relaxed n mean with those slip ons quiet opposite to del toro's who u slowly get to know as the movie unfolds. Del toro's character was emotionless and relentless. It is his best performance to date. The only scene i couldn't digest was the dinner scene. I turned my eyes n was shocked for few mins."", 'Excellent directing by Villeneuve with perfect cinematography and score. The sunset tunnel approach scene should be made into a poster. The use of the filters from night vision to thermal vision was excellent. The casting and performances were exceptional and very convincing, especially del Toro, whom I feel was the cherry on top. Just his simple ""ssssssth"" during the choking rescue scene is enough to make your hair stand on end. The writing had some plot and technical issues, and needed more clarity in some scenes. But the non-stop tension, suspense and scenes that will make you gasp with disbelief, along with the perfect pacing and 121 min runtime, makes you overlook those little flaws. It just all feels so real. An astonishing film that will impress even if this isn\'t your genre.', ""Don't get me wrong, it is a good film, but I waited on and on for that special thing that made it deserve eight stars over here and win so much admiration all over the Internet, but it never arrives. Nothing special happened really.Also, usually if they give a woman such a role they tend to show them as strong and smart, but it was hugely disappointing to see Kate literally play a cow, a weak, dumb woman who has nothing else to do except giving curious looks! She is in a sense irrelevant to the film, the story and everything undertaken by that FBI team. The only thing of note that she does is almost having sex with a person from the enemy group!"", 'I was really stoked about Sicario and went to see it the night it opened. Why was I excited? Well, the posters looked cool and I knew that celebrated director Dennis Villeneuve was expected to deliver a fresh and intelligent suspense movie with a nice dose of action.That, plus Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin are in it, and I think they\'re cool.What I got was a gritty action movie, but unfortunately it wasn\'t intelligent or thought-provoking. When I\'m watching Expendables 3, I\'m ready to sit back, enjoy the ride and hold back on the nit-picking. That\'s not really an option, though, when you have to pay attention to follow the story, and are promised new insights into a deep-rooted problem.*** Spoilers ahead *** I thought it was clever that we see the plot from the perspective of an ingénue, this time in the form of a ""small-time"" FBI agent (Kate Mercer played by Emily Blunt). After her SWAT team storms a horror house run by the Mexican cartels in which two of her fellow officers are killed, she\'s ready to go after the big guys. Her new CIA-lead team is willing to use ""unconventional"" (read: highly questionable) methods. They extract a drug lord from a Mexican prison and torture him for information. Kate is told that she is there to ""watch and learn"", but ultimately she finds out that she is only there as a goon to legitimize the CIA operating in the homeland. Her function is not to ""watch and learn"" but to shut up, keep out and to sign a paper at the end. For the time being though, the team storms a tunnel used to smuggle drugs across the border in a scene that seems to take a page straight out of Zero Dark Twenty ...*** Spoilers thick on the ground from here on *** Sicario really annoyed me because it brings together so much promise with an incredibly lackluster plot. I feel like I could write an entire book about it. What\'s the point of the horror house at the beginning? If the cartel is using it to dispose bodies, why would they shrink-wrap the corpses? Why are there gun-toting criminals in a house full of incriminating evidence? Why are the corpses behind dry walls (is the cartel planning on renting out the house)? Why is the trap-door booby-trapped? Why do police have to anticipate that in about six months every further crime scene will be booby-trapped if they don\'t stop the cartel now? When they are illegally extracting the cartel boss from the Mexican prison, why are they doing it in a highly visible convoy? If they anticipate being ambushed just before the frontier, why don\'t they keep a lane open? Why didn\'t they use a helicopter? Why don\'t they just torture the guy in Mexico? What are the ambushers trying to achieve? What is the role of the crooked cop? Could he be any hammier than carrying a gel bend around that the cartel uses to hold their bankrolls together? And on and on.Five points because of the acting and the cinematography. For an intelligent thriller on the Mexican drugs war, I\'d recommend Traffic over Sicario any time.', 'This movie was okey. Nothing special about it. From time to time I found it kinda boring to be honest, or maybe I was just tired. It had good actors, but I did not feel much for the characters. I did not like the story that much either, but the ending was good and brutal. The action was not that good and almost nonexistent. It was more of a thriller, showing that there are people on the good side doing immoral things for the greater good. That the end justifies the means.Is it just me or was is too easy for Benicio to get to the cartelboss at the end? He did not have to kill many bodyguards...Oh well, maybe I will like it more if I watch it again.', ""Jesus.This was intense. So much so that it made me kind of uncomfortable. I was squirming in my seat. And it was extremely dark. Not color wise, but the subject matter. Villeneuve really knows how to take the most vile subjects and turn them into wholly compelling cinema.The cast was uniformly excellent. The big three of Blunt, Brolin & Del Toro are all crazy good. Even though Blunt has the lead role it's definitely not a showy part...it's very understated with a lot of it consisting of looks. An internal performance, for sure, but one that might just be the best of her career. Brolin is given a role that at first seems like nothing more than comic relief, but as the film goes on he keeps becoming more and more a part of the character until close to the end when all the jokes disappear and he becomes something else entirely. It was really cool to see that transition. Very good work from him and there are times where it feels like he's stealing the whole movie away from the others. Which brings me to Mr. Del Toro. What else is there to say except Ho Lee Sh!t. This man was just on a completely different level with this performance. Another one that begins very internal consisting of a lot of looks mixed with one or two word responses...then gradually as the film progresses and his background and motives become clearer he, like Brolin, becomes something else entirely. But at the same time never going overboard with it...still keeping that quiet intensity he's had throughout. All three performances are absolutely fantastic and among the best of the year. Hell, Del Toro's might even be the best of the year. Haunting stuff.As mentioned above this a very intense film. The set-pieces in this are unbelievable. The opening raid, The Border crossing, The night- vision/tunnel sequence and finally The dinner scene. Just pure craziness.With that being said - I don't think this is an Oscar movie. It's just way too dark for the Academy's liking. Very much like Villeneuve's Prisoners, both films are more than deserving of awards attention, but unfortunately the Academy rarely goes for films this dark.See this movie ASAP. Preferably in a theater. Just know you might need a shower afterward."", ""This movie gets way too much hype for the fantasy that it actually is. The vast majority of murders and kidnappings in the Mexico cartel wars are carried out by males in their 20s and in mostly amateur fashion. The depiction of the Super Sicario here is pure Hollywood. The idea of a Super Sicario who expertly hunts down American agents and moves within their ranks is absolutely ridiculous. Also, the idea that there are delta force (type) raids and assassinations going on with U.S. military or covert assets is simply not accurate. When a Mexican cartel boss or lieutenant is brought down in real life, it's generally in boring fashion while they hide in a hotel room or get involved in a shootout with a rival cartel. Finally, illegal practices such as torture are glamorized and depicted as effective, when all real-world intel gathering professionals will tell you otherwise. Cross border tunnel raids in which dozens are killed is just the icing on the Hollywood cake. In any case, this is obviously fiction and the film does try to depict the nebulous nature of the war on drugs near the U.S.-Mexico border. The story is taut and very well directed by Villeneuve. The film does not take a stand on one side or the other - the drug trade and all the violence that it entails, especially in the 2000's, is the direct result of American demand for the product. Further, the movie attempts to demonstrate that the volume of drugs passing through (or under) our border crossings simply would not be possible without massive corruption on both sides. All in all I was disappointed because I am very familiar with the areas in which it was set and the U.S-Mexico dialectic concerning the war on (some) drugs and horrific cartel violence in Juarez, MX. I thought that while the direction was more than competent, it wasn't Villeneuve's best work and that Taylor Sheridan took way too much creative license and that the end result was a highly stylized flick that doesn't capture the boring and even more horrifying aspects of the situation in Mexico. I suppose my main problem with the movie, however, was the idea of a super assassin and that it depicts the U.S. as way more interested in what is going on down there than it actually is."", ""Hard to find a thriller like Sicario these days , watch it! My thought is that a good Thriller title is the hardest case you can go for as a movie maker .A good thriller has to keep you hooked and in tense for the whole movie ,worst case for most of the movie.Sicario manages to provide the right amount of thrill and action in a way it keeps you interested through all of the time.Sure it had its flaws and sometimes i was a little disappointed with the decision the writers made with this one but when i look at the whole picture its coming up as a very good film , i honestly couldn't stop watching and was a little sad when it was over. I must say though that this movie has a political opinions in it that you cant overlook and it can be a little con for some viewers. Overall , this movie is truly a gem to Hollywood industry right now , very well written and directed plus it has outstanding cast."", ""Not so much story, the characters not so great. It lacked an engaging story and you didn't care about the characters. I also think that a cartel boss would have dozens of men guarding his house not just three at the gate."", 'Sicario was billed to me as a great movie to watch.\nI was expecting something along the lines of Crash, silence of the lambs mexican style or essentially a confronting movie with blood, gore, police fights and telling chases.Instead were left with a slow plot instead.The start of the movie delivered exactly what I expected. A confronting Gang hiding people in walls and life being cheap. Perfect, we see clearly why Emily would go on a mission south. Now we find Emily and a Mexican police escort posse 15 cars long go into the dangerous zone with corpses hanging by the side of the road warding them off. Good start.Then the traffic jam! wow this convoy is stuck in traffic and they see 2 gang cars in the distance also stuck in traffic. How convenient, so they wonder over, gang cars pull guns on them, get shot and they get a crumb of information.... right I bought that plot leap!Now we have this \'shock\' that US agencies go across the border to arrest and torture bad guys who appear to be quite bad. No redeeming features of them, just gang thugs being pushed to confess. Emily and her partner push to their boss wanting more details and answers...flagging their procedural concerns there. It\'s illuminating but sicario fails to ramp up the tension. It\'s officers asking their boss ""are we ok to do this""...""yes"".\nIt doesn\'t bring out the objections clear enough. The biggest problem being the FBI involved are \'in the dark\', not the torture nor their reaction to the torture.So Emily gets drunk, her partner introduces her to a ""good man"" they get it on. When she realises he was carrying a bank note wrap identical to the wrap used in this mornings bust at the bank. After playing an almost helpless white female, a man comes to her rescue and gets this corrupt cop off her.Again how convenient. Lets just have a QF make another plot leap. Now they interrogate the corrupt cop and find out the location of the other corrupt cops. The only redeeming factor here is the corrupt cop being told that it\'s his family in protective custody or their addresses posted on Reddit.Then there is the tunnel scene which is meant to impress us with IR technology. Emily confronts Del Toro after he finds another corrupt cop ""silvio"" loading money in the trunk. Emily goes to stop him and Del Toro shoots her in her armor.\nDel toro then proceeds to use the corrupt cop to get into the gang mansion and kill everyone there. Including the gang leaders family as they sit to eat a meal. It is 100% unclear if Emily knows any of this or if Del Toro is just immune to bullets.Also this is the death of Silvio, the father of the mexican kid playing soccer. the Kid being bossed around to get his bratty father stuff while he lives the life of the family father god. I had no idea why this was added. You make a heartfelt father and kill him I would understand as this provides connection to the brown people being blown apart, tortured and killed during the movie. You make a flawed and real father then you get a real connection. Instead you have made a demanding father that does nothing with his kid who the kid feels ambivalent about his passing in circumstances unknown. what was the point!The real crunch, Del toro this assassin is the one who confronts Emily to fill in the paperwork greenlighting the whole operation and to say it followed procedure. Right, your assassin paid to take out another drug cartel is the one ensuring the paperwork is signed! After wanting to see this for a few years and hearing a lot of hype, this is a fizza.', 'The overall ideas and the way they present the scenes were intense and received quite the reaction it perhaps intended. First few minutes with scary death bodies inside the walls were very promising. However, most of the plots are poorly written, is it real that a big cartel was only guarded by few people? But the other (men) lead characters played their part okay, they lifted the poorly written story a little bit.Most critics go to Emily Blunt\'s character. Up until now, I still don\'t get why was she even there. I don\'t get the ""tension"" or whatever it is she\'s supposed to be showing, maybe conflicts? To me, it is unrealistic for a field agent who\'s been ""kicking doors since day one"" really follow the rules by the book with no adaption at all. And the supposedly ""smart"" agent doesn\'t get how bad a cartel can be is beyond me - I\'m no police but I get how bad ""cartel"" can get, and I only used imagination. I just don\'t get it, I feel only annoyed with the character, she is really unnecessary. Overall, I only get this ""annoyed by Emily Blunt"" feeling after watching the movie, not much anything else. I\'m giving some marks for the other actors and for the ""tense"".']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"['Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) is a classic phenomenal arguably the best sci-fi film in trilogy away, the one that started all and arguably changed the face of cinema forever. I love this film is actually my number 1 favorite film in the franchise and it is George Lucas masterpiece - the man who make this film happening. He wrote and Directed him self, I love this film to death! I love everything that is in A New Hope. Before I go in to this movie I want to say after watching the new awful horrible movie Episode VII The Force Awakens, I decide to re watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and I have always loved A New Hope and I always will. This was the first film in the trilogy that I have saw as a kid and that I remember. Star Wars are starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.The plot is actually more about Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia (Fisher), and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire\'s space station, the Death Star. It is a mission returning the plans of Death Star to the Rebel Alliance, while Galactic Empire want\'s them back and it is lead by Darth Vader (David Prowse). This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and Special Effects.Star Wars is a film that I have watch it now and I will always watch it , because how much I really, really enjoy this film. This fun, pure joy, entertaining and truly a great film is like a classic, I recommend this film to any fan of the Star Wars trilogy, my favorite will always be A New Hope. This was the film that I have saw the first time as a kid and it grow on me. I love introduction when C-3PO and R2-D2 are walking trough the desert on planet Tatooine and are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. Here is the first time we met the character Luke Skywalker. This is the scene where C-3PO is walking trough the desert him self and than he saw someone far away and yells for help. I love this scene and it is the scene I remember from childhood.Which is your favorite character? My favorite character of all time is Luke Skywalker and I really love him so much. My second favorite character will be Han Solo but Luke Skywalker will be the ultimate hero of the galaxy for me.I love this flick, I love the end battle on Death Star, Luke joins the Rebel assault squadron and Luke becomes one of the few surviving pilots. Vader leads a squad of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Luke\'s X-wing fighter, but Han returns and fires on the Imperials, sending Vader spiraling away. Helped by guidance from Obi-Wan\'s spirit, Luke uses the Force and successfully destroys the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the Rebel base. I love that scene.I love John Williams score for Star wars which is the best score ever! It is an excellent score makes an actions scenes more exciting and more intense. George Lucas directed this movie well and did an excellent job been a writer as the same time been the director, the pacing is excellent the actors does an awesome job. I also love and I have enjoyed the character Darth Vader and I also love this film because it has a happy ending. Harrison Ford , Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher did all a great joy playing their characters.Carrie Fisher is really gorgeous in this film and for the 70\'s film it had great pacing and great imaginary story that dose not gives you only a snippet of the backstory. The fight scene between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi was excellent and the death scene of Obi-Wan was a honorable death. Alec Guinness did a perfect job as Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi he is excellent. Overall: I have said everything about this film that I love I forgot to mention I love Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker (I love to death), Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2. This flick get\'s a perfect 10 because it is the best beloved science fiction film.R.I.P. Carrie Fisher (1956 - 2016) she was the perfect Princess Leia and she is very missed.', 'Star wars made epic fantasy real. For a generation of people it has defined what the cinema experience is meant to be. Today it is probable that pc games will offer a deeper and more satisfying entertainment solution, but for pure visual and aural pleasure, mixed with basic emotional manipulation, there has never and will never be a better example of cinema than when star wars appeared over 25 years ago. When you think of star wars, you must remember what else was happening at the time. In America, the war in Vietnam had been lost. In the U.K economic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the army collecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technically advanced countries in the world were going backwards. Star wars let everybody escape from that reality and reach for a future that was uncertain but ultimately good.', 'In respect to the many kids of the seventies. I rated this movie as one of the greatest movies ever made. I was thirteen and enjoyed this fantasy getaway more than I could count. Like many other kids of the seventies you left reality before walking into the theatre and escaped into the adventure once the reels begin rolling. It provided the special effects and excitement a kid was looking for. Even today when I watch this movie on VHS I recall those times. Whenever I get the chance to watch it I feel like that eager thirteen year old over and over again. I hope the new movies will meet the same expectations of kids of  this decade and the next.', 'This movie is a cinematic masterpiece that will be loved forever. The special affects are so good for 1977 and the soundtrack for this movie is amazing.', 'This movie when I first saw it as a kid absolutely amazed me and put me into a world where I wished I could be! The story is absolutely genius, the characters are amazing! Everything about this movie is amazing! George Lucas made an absolute masterpiece of a film!!!!! May The Force Be With You!', ""Filled with great characters and a fun story, Star Wars is well deserving of its reputation as a classic. John Williams score alone makes this a film worth seeing. The characters are unforgettable and the special effects impressive for its time, but very outdated now. The different alien species are one of the best things about the film. The Cantina scene showing an array of Lucas' creations is particularly fun.I give this film a 7/10. Looking at it subjectively, it isn't a really good film. A lot of clichés, bad dialogue, cracker jack philosophy, and unimpressive acting. Yet, for some reason, I find it hard to say anything bad about this movie. My favorite film as a child, and one I still enjoy, mostly for nostalgia."", ""Only seen the original Star Wars films a few times, I tend to forget how great of a magical experience it is! A New Hope is so awesome in so many aspects especially the music and sounds of everything! It's amazing how it was made for it's time I still I don't understand how they did many things. I will admit it has a few bits that are boring but still glorious. Up until a few years ago I didn't see most of the films and I didn't understand the hype now I do in which I'm happy with them all even seen the new ones."", ""There's not much to say about this movie this is *THE* movie that changed it all.It's my favourite movie, and not only among the quadrilogy, among all movies";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"[""In the 1990's, a stream of remakes came out after the universal horror films with the monsters: Dracula(Bram Stoker's Dracula), Frankenstein(Mary Shelley's Frankenstein), The Wolf Man(Wolf) and now The Mummy made after the same title. The original stared Boris Karloff and is truly a haunting movie. Despite the fact that slow moving mummies are not as scary of a villain, Boris brought in an incredible eerie performance that is so memorable that made mummies scary. How could we update the story to make mummies more terrifying to a newer audience? Make them faster? Make them smarter? How much they could control? How dangerous they truly are? They put a bunch of CGI into the film but somehow despite it being over the top at times, the story is what makes The Mummy into a great remake and respects the original making the mummy scary again.In 1926, Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist Evelyn is presented with an intricate box and map by her bumbling brother Jonathan, who says he found it. After the pair discover the map leads to Hamunaptra, Jonathan reveals he actually stole it from an American named Rick O'Connell, who is currently in prison. Rick tells them that he knows the location of the city because his unit reached the fabled city, only to be overrun by hostile Bedouins. He makes a deal with Evelyn to reveal the location of Hamunaptra, in exchange for Evelyn saving Rick from being hanged. Rick leads Evelyn and Jonathan's small expedition to the city, where they discover a mummy who Evelyn accidentally wakes up and he's after a band of American treasure hunters who have taken his treasures and wants Evelyn to bring back his true love that he died for.I really liked the actors they put in this film. I know Brendan Fraiser isn't the best actor, but he really made me believe in him as an adventure hero almost to the likes of Indiana Jones. He's funny, smart, strong, charming and handsome, everything you could want. Rachel Weisz as Evelyn was beautiful, stubborn and smart, she was exactly what all these boys needed and had great chemistry with Fraiser. The humor is a lot, they use a lot of jokes which at times could take away from the film. The CGI is also a lot, but it added to the story and wasn't to the point of unbelievable. I thought the idea of having a faster mummy was more terrifying and that he wouldn't stop coming after his victims in such a horrific way was a great idea. I really did like The Mummy, I know it certainly has it's flaws, but it's just a fun adventure horror movie that really hooks you from beginning to end. The sequels just didn't add up well to this movie, I would recommend The Mummy any day. The haters honestly just don't know how to have any fun, any flawed film could still be a good time and The Mummy certainly is one one them.8/10"", ""Certainly this Universal remake is more in the vain of Indiana Jones rather than the original Mummy.  It is high on adventure and comedy, and wins because of it.  The sets, scenery, special effects are all first-rate.  The film is fast-paced from beginning to end and is very suspenseful.  Stephen Sommers again shows his talent as a director for creating action-packed adventure with a high level of comedic overtones.  The cast are all very good in their roles, yet none of them seem really to be taking themselves or the film too serious.  Brendan Fraser is an affable hero, and Rachel Weisz makes a good heroine.  Good support comes from John Hannah, Kevin J. O'Connor, and the mummy, Arnold Vosloo.  Also a real treat was seeing Bernard Fox in a small role as an aging British pilot.  Don't expect the old mummy of lore in this one, but sit down and have one heck of a ride...a rollercoaster of hijinks in the sands of Egypt."", 'This was one of the ""low-brain-but-so-damn-entertaining""- type of films. ""The Mummy"" was an action packed adventure flick with great humor and nice special effects (The Mummy itself could have been better though). I enjoyed every moment with this one. There was no boring parts and Brendan Fraser makes a great performance as the Indiana Jones wannabe (HEH! JOKE!!). Lot of big time effects nice action, very funny jokes and nice GROOVE!!7/10', 'Just wanted to say - this movie still holds up in 2022. Even though this is coming from a 90\'s baby, with nostalgia and memories from our childhood in mind, this is still such a great\nmovie.Acting is good, wonderful cast. Both protagonists and antagonists really made you feel specifically about them, sowing no doubt in your mind who is who. But, it does feature some tropes from the era - the music, the ""let\'s stand still and look at people being devoured"" , the over the top action sequences and Michael Bay style explosions, and many more .But, would definitely recommend this movie to anybody up for a good couple of flashbacks and a generally good watch!', 'I will have to say that ""Mummy"" was an action adventure film in the spirit of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". I know there have been other attempts over the years, but ""The Mummy"" comes the closest to hitting the mark.""The Mummy"", directed by Stephen Sommers, is the story of librarian and aspiring archaeologist Evelyn (Rachel Wiesz), accompanied by her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), enlisting the help of French Foreign Legion soldier Rick O\'Connell (Brendan Fraser) to find a lost Egyptian city. I prefer not to say more as this type of plot is best when the story unfolds before you.Sommers directing is fast paced. There is never a dull moment, never a talky interlude to break the tone of the action. Every scene in the film is necessary for the plot advancement. Director Sommers knows an inherent part of any action film is to keep the camera moving. There are very few ""static shots"".The special effects, by ILM, are fantastic. I was hooked from the opening sweeping shot of a bustling city in ancient Eygpt, beautifully recreated.Brendan Fraser is a very credible action hero. As Rick O\'Connell, he has such a clumsy, boyish charm you can\'t help but like him. With a half smile and his perchant for the understatement (""You brought a new friend back from the desert, didn\'t you Beni?""), he is almost the equal of Harrison Ford\'s Indiana Jones. Rachel Weisz is wonderful as the aspiring archaeologist Evelyn and John Hannah is fun as her near do well missionary brother Jonathan. Kevin J. O\'Conner as scared of his own shadow Beni (I won\'t reveal what his role is in the story) is delightful.What keeps this film from being the equal of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is the lack of character curve. Unlike Indiana Jones, who learned the hard way to respect powers he can\'t touch or see, I can\'t think of anything any of the characters in ""The Mummy"" learned.However, ""The Mummy"" is still rip-roaring entertainment. Sommers and Executive Producer Kevin Jarre (screenwriter, ""Glory"") wisely created a film with an emphasis on action. They must have figured (rightly so) that any story about the Mummy presented to 1999 audiences would just not be scary, so the tone was changed to action/adventure.Action films greatly rely on the ability to make the audience believe that what they see is possible within the first five to ten minutes. If this doesn\'t happen, the viewer will have a poor experience for the rest of the film. Most action films cannot achieve this. They ""shoot their bolt"" too early, rendering the rest of the film unbelievable. Also, the closer an action film is to related reality, the more difficult this becomes. Like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (still my all time favorite action film), ""The Mummy"" allowed me to suspend my disbelief within the first ten minutes.', ""Man, what a turkey.  Let me see... $150M on special effects and $20 on plot and acting.  I'm not going to waste a bunch of time commenting on this movie except to say that it was one of the worst pieces of junk I have ever watched.  The acting was terrible, the plot was horrible, the dialog was stupid... the special effects, however, were very good."", ""Stephen Sommers is an interesting person. He 'homaged' the Mummy films of old and many other horror classics in his 'Mummy' films and 'Van Helsing.' Van Helsing was good, the Mummy Returns was shite... but The Mummy was a classic.Not because it was original - hardly - but it didn't try to be more than it was, had time for a romance, great special effects, John Hannah (a brilliant actor) and Rachel Weisz (a fantastic and beautiful actress), Brendan Fraser doing Indiana Jones, amazing action sequences, good humor... and didn't have the snot-nosed kid from the sequel.But if there was one scene that truly pulled it away from 'Indiana Jones'-ripoff, it was the Museum of Antiquities scene, with the hoard of Imhotep-zombies attacks. This is more in the vein of horror films - but it works spectacularly here.7/10 - minus three stars because Arnold Vosloo isn't menacing enough as Imhotep, we don't see all of the Ten Plagues of Egypt (which are fascinating), and we don't see Beni die."", ""This is less a remake and more a re-imagining of the original Mummy movie. Where as the Boris Karloff version is pretty much an out and out 1930's horror, this is very much an action adventure in the style of Indiana Jones, a movie that The Mummy cannot help being compared to.Much like Indiana Jones it harks back to the Saturday matinées of years gone by, but with a budget. The plot is, of course, simple. Ancient evil\x85 lovable rogue\x85 race against time\x85 comedy characters\x85 yadda yadda yadda. Let's be frank";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The complete lack of coherence or meaning makes it an exercise in frustration, leaving me more confused than ever about why this abomination was made. The actors, shamelessly taking on roles that should have come with a warning label, only add to the misery.

What's truly entertaining is sifting through the suspicious 10/10 ratings. It becomes a game to spot the paid or bot-generated reviews, making this detective work more enjoyable than enduring the movie itself. In the realm of Bollywood disappointments, this movie serves as a reminder of the challenges in Bollywood filmmaking, where lackluster plots, an abundance of unnecessary twists, and a distressing dose of misogyny can overshadow any cinematic potential."", 'In the cinematic landscape of the past 5 to 7 years, this movie stands as a beacon of originality amidst a sea of formulaic productions. Breaking free from the recycled narratives, it\'s a refreshing sip of new wine in an industry often pouring old ones into new bottles. Amidst the exceptions like Bahubali and KGF, this film emerges as a paragon of authenticity. Witnessing moments of emotional intensity, it could be deemed one of the most emotionally charged films to date. The film\'s pacing is a tale of two halves, with the first delivering entertainment and intensity, while the second gains fervor upon Bobby Deol\'s entry. Sandeep Reddy Vanga\'s audacious storytelling steals the spotlight, cementing ""Animal"" as a standout in this year\'s cinematic landscape. The amount of violence in this movie is overwhelming in a good way, the blood and gore is not for the faint hearted, definitely a benchmark.Ranbir Kapoor\'s fantastic performance and transitions set this violent revenge saga on fire hands down. Ranbir Kapoor\'s stellar performance solidifies his position as the superstar of Indian cinema. AK is excellent in the confrontational scenes and Bobby looks menacing, but both have very little to do. Rashmika did a good job. A must-watch for those seeking a gripping and well-crafted film. Highly Recommended.', ""A movie about a son's (RK) love for his father (AK) and to what extreme he goes to destroy and execute those who want to harm his father!

Rashmika's role wasn't special could have been played by any actress the rest of the cast were good. Bobby Deol's extended cameo ( only came at the end part of the movie) was pure swagger mixed with rage should have used more time on his character.

It was a waste of time, money, and mental well-being.I won't accept if the producers would be claiming that this is what the audience desires. The film entirely reflects the creator's preferences and choices. The female co-stars were on-screen primarily to deliver bodily content and engage in an unnecessary display of nudity.

His character had no consistency. Even if you make a negative character, his actions need to be consistent. In one instant they want to show he is unhinged and doesn't care, and then next instant he would forgive and protect them.A movie needs to have a story, a plot, characters need to make sense inside the movie.Their attempt at jokes were so distasteful. He gives a wedgie to a servant, rants about his underwear, there's two monologues about pubic hair, there's denial about medicine.Even the climax was so underwhelming. They just faught in one song.Worse part was how they used Sikhs in the movie. They tried to use them to do idk what. But they're just around to elevate Ranvijay.

Without completing the action, the next scene immediately moved to sly and statham fighting over a ring and then switched back to the terrorist attack scene. There are many examples that show the film lacks of basic editing and storytelling skills. However, the worst part is the ending where they do a dumb twist that sly is faking his death to lure out the villain. How did he do that? He dragged an innocent man to the pilot seat so that the villain and the expendables thought the corpse was sly when the plane crashed. Excuse me, who is the bad guy now? They character assassinated basically everyone here. Lastly, Megan Fox cringes me to death with zero facial expression and bad dialogues."", '2.5 out of 5 stars.The Expendables 4 is a pretty bad action film that is a franchise that is supposed to have a stardom of actors and brutal action flick that pays homage to the 80s action films. This sequel falls off that list.Plot is thin and forgettable. A predictable twist to the villain.The cast ensemble is thin. Jason Statham is on the spotlight and taking the lead role which is great. While Stallone is sitting majority of the film out. Dolph Lundgren and Randy Coulture being the only original cast was okay. While new faces like 50 Cent, Jacob Scipio, Levy Tran, Iko Uwais, Tony Jaa, and Megan Fox are all decent. Mostly everyone is under utilized on screen while the action focuses on Statham.The film has plenty of action sequences. The direction relies heavily on cgi on the action which nothing is as practical compared to the other films. The bad thing is the cgi is horrible. Most explosions looks like a bad video game effects. The fight scenes are cluttered. The director Scott Waugh did a poor job in handling the action sequences and giving every talent a spotlight in the action.Overall, it is one of the worst Expendables film alongside the third film which the series is running on fumes.', ""I can't believe they pulled a fast and furious fake death plot device, but I should've expected it at this point. This franchise needs to end after this movie for sure. I only saw this because I actually liked the first 3 (because of how fun they were, and this movie barely has any of the fun those movies had and shouldn't have been made, doesn't feel like the other 3 at all). It had almost no redeeming qualities. I guess I'll give it props for maybe a couple good action sequences and stunts (plus Levy Tran was hot) but that's all.Megan Fox is suddenly a high ranked Expendable, why? Where did she come from all of the sudden?? All the cringe dialogue and gross sexual jokes that weren't even funny? Please. A villain that wasn't interesting too, too much shaky cam directing, and a waste of Sylvester Stallone. I guess also if you like Jason Statham you'd like this movie but for real, wasn't enough for me. What a disappointment!"", ""Fun film for B or A- action film. Director was poor in camera work. Seriously stop the shaky cam. It's annoying. Fox maybe her worst acting job... which is saying a lot being such a mediocre actress anyway. However, if you like Meg this movie is more or less good for you.I recommend low expectations as at best a popcorn action film. No crazy plot or insane action. Really typical action with a little over the top unrealistic action sequences we have come to know with this serious. I enjoyed the movie for what it was but I can understand why there is likely not going to be a 5th. I think the magic is pretty much gone."", ""So you've got Statham, Stallone, Lundgren, a bunch of new stars, Iko Uwais and Tony Jaa, and you come up with the most boring drag with dull action sequences. Scott Waugh whose filmography isn't great enough to start with (he made the most boring video game adaptation NFS).Expendables was supposed to be a throwback to old action movies of Sly and Arnie's. But now its a discount Fast and Furious. Problem is instead of bringing directors who have the love for the action genre of 80s and 90s, but instead of that, they are bringing in new action directors. Like Simon West was a good choice.Positives -\n1. Jason Statham\n2. The Opening Action Scene\n3. Iko Uwais as the bad guyNegatives -\n1. Too many unnecessary characters who got nothing to do - specially Jacob Scipio, 50 Cents, Levy Tran, and Megan Fox.2. The predictable fake out death\n3. The predictable ending twist\n4. Too little Tony Jaa\n5. Too short Statham vs Uwais which lasts for only 2 mins.6. The climax fight\n7. Too little action sequences (only 2 major action sequences)\n8. Noticable green screen/bad vfx.If this film wasn't given a proper budget, they should have hired someone credible from Direct to DVD directors like Issac Florentine or William Kauffman. They know how to keep things interesting in a little budget.Overall a huge disappointment."", 'I thought it was a good movie the action was awesome I will say i wish it was a little longer maybe by like 30 minutes and I do wish they would have used Curtis ""50 cent"" Jackson a little more since it was his first time in this franchise other than that if you\'ve seen all the other ones like I have I definitely would say go see it if you\'ve never seen them and this looks interesting to you I would highly recommend watching the first three and then seeing this I\'m not saying it 100% requires all the backstory if the first 3 but i think it would be nice to have going into this one all in all I enjoyed it.', ""No charm, cheese or humour, flat delivery of most of the lines, weak acting and a predictable and tired plot an 80's action B-movie would have rejected. Some of the action scenes were good but the shift from a team of Special Ops to a single operative made it feel stale and like every other action movie and didn't allow for any character development of the new team members or villains. The CGI was very bad and made all the big events look cartoony, the camaraderie between the stars was painful to watch and how they ended it all was unbelievably bad. Thankfully, it wasn't too long, but I really hope they don't make another one."", ""I really enjoyed the earlier installments in the Expendables franchise. They're never going to win awards, but for silly check-brain-at-door action movies they were good value. The cast and crew weren't taking themselves too sensibly. The plot was paper-thin, but they were *fun*.This one just didn't gel for me at all. The action felt pedestrian, with far too much CGI. Very little of the previous banter, far too much seriousness and way too little fun.And then my biggest problem with the movie: Megan Fox. Seriously, how does this woman ever get work as an actress? In the previous movies, the cast at least had some action movie chops. Fox just ... doesn't. Pumped up lips, caked-on makeup, unwatchable. Ugh."", ""The same simple plot, the same so so cgi, but the tone is right and I wished we had this kinda of movie instead of the Expendables 3, that cast with Mel Gibson as the main villain and the bad writing for Arnold's and Jet Li's characters was such a missed oportunity. Also the PG13 rating was so non sense! Now we have the R rating back and Actually if we combine Expendables 3&4 we will get a proper Expendables movie!I just hope this will sell better than the Box Office prediction and will kill big time on demand and home video sales & rental because we need another sequel asap before Sly will retire, bring\nback Wesley Snipes too!Better than expected (i had almost no expectation) !"", 'For the older generations of movie fans, this is a bliss. A big shot of nostalgia, humour, very good action scenes and a large amount of actors charisma.For me, the surprises here are two - relatively big role for Megan Fox, who is gorgeous and with excellent chemistry to Jason Statham, and the character of Dolph Lundgren, who is better than ever here.Yes, some CGI look cheesy and most of the budget obviously went for salaries. But when you have in the same frame such charismatic men (and women), and the dialogue is full of one-liners and old school jokes, how can you complain?It is excellent popcorn entertainment for a man, and maybe for a woman too.', ""Another solid addition to the Expendables franchise. The only negative thing I have to say about this film is that it has some bad CGI of the plane flying, landing and deploying land rovers on a tarmac at the beginning. Other than that, you can expect to enjoy some fun, mindless action in a Jason Stathom-centric movie.If you've seen the other films, than you know what to expect. If you haven't, you don't need to see the others to watch this one as they're only vaguely connected, and don't necessarily build off each other. Need a action film that doesn't require much from you? Look to Expendables."", '100 million for this? The CGI was mid 1990s quality and the filters they are using to age down Stallone, Lundgren and Statham are terrible. Stallone has more fillers and Botox in his face than Janice Dickinson or Renee Zelwegger.Iko Uwais was the only redeeming aspect of this film. The plot was probably generated by AI since no writer could be this bad. Personally, I would have had Isaac Florentine direct this because he does an amazing job with his low budget Scott Adkins films like Albert Pyun did in the 90s with Cyborg and Nemesis.This is a hack movie that should have gone direct to Netflix. Jason Statham us racking up an impressive career of garbage. Why not just pair him with Kevin Hart and we can see the worst movie ever made.', ""The rug has finally been pulled out from under the expendables, a film that cost close to a hundred million has hardly made a third of it back. A franchise that should have stopped after the first and is rumoured to continue for another trilogy should, for its own good, be put to rest. The original expendables was good fun and full of outrageous quotes and enjoyment but each passing sequel has suffered from declining plot and acting performance. I would have more tolerance for the movie if it didn't see to treat the audience as if they were brain dead at every turn. There's no creativity or thrill with the expendables anymore, if they never make another we will all be better off.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The narrative is so overstuffed it would fill a Mosasaurus, the action frustratingly lacks any kind of tension, horror or real threat to the main characters and the occasional call backs seen in JW and JW:FK are now as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. That's not to say its a bad film, there's some excellent character moments with the original cast and Jeff Goldblum is brilliant, injecting some much needed humour into this otherwise pretty dry sequel.

It wasn't glowing, but it was positive. Unfortunately, this is a mess. Others have already talked about the issues I have. Granted, this is an empty headed summer movie, it could still have been done with some serious thought. I was hanging in there throughout with a new dinosaur attack every three minutes, and velociraptors going at fifty miles per hour and not getting tired. Humans being assaulted time after time and yet showing no fatigue. I also didn't see a scratch on any of them. But the best of all was the promise made to a baby dinosaur and his mother that precluded saving the world from famine. Not to mentioned the coincidences of everyone showing up in just the right places. I still don't understand how they got into that facility so easily. The return of the original cast was not helpful other than Jeff Goldblum's sarcasm. Anyway, it's all been said. This is a poor movie."", 'It\'s just amazing that no dinosaur hasn\'t bitten it off yet. In what promises to be the conclusion to the series, all the main cast members of the previous shows are here.

What is that you say? ""2001: A Space Odyssey""? ""Star Wars""? Well, perhaps, but they aren\'t nearly as entertaining as Paul Verhoeven\'s extravagant, unhinged and excessively violent dystopian saga. This film is probably the most cynical, yet simultaneously the most straight-faced parody in history. Look closely at the FedNet propaganda, the Aryan lead characters and their costumes, the careless sacrificing of the Infantry forces... This futuristic battle set in 2197 is a replay of WWII, but somehow Verhoeven succeeded in making us root for the fascist party! I honestly don\'t think there is much to write about ""Starship Troopers"", except that it\'s nearly perfect and brilliant from every possible angle. After the already amazing ""Robocop"" and ""Total Recall"", Verhoeven reached the ultimate in genius Sci-Fi. It\'s all there: the F/X, the humor, the cast, the bloodshed, the scenery, ... The only things you have to add yourself are beer and popcorn.', 'With a magnificent script that includes everything, love, war, aliens, extinction of the human race, and with a great interpretation of all its actors, and great effects in space and surface warfare, they have achieved a great movie.', 'If the acting, lines, and scenes were just a little bit better, than this movie would be one of the worst of all time, but, since it completely sucks in every department, it has to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The acting is incredibly bad, the lines are terrible, the props are horrible, possibly the worst sex-scene in history, the storyline is ridiculous, just about every single part of this movie is a catastrophic failure, and that is why I love it. One has to ask themselves when watching this movie ""Why? Who could seriously make a movie this bad?"". Hopefully, the directors realized how bad the movie was and just went with it. The whole concept is just stupid. Just incredibly stupid. If you want a laugh, definitely go and get this movie, you won\'t regret it.', ""Starship Troopers is a subtle and insidiously subversive movie that proved frighteningly prescient in the wake of post-9/11 uberpatriotism.  Both Heinlein's book and Verhoeven's film are valid and interesting political statements at opposite ends of the spectrum.  Heinlein's novel was criticized as fascist at the time of its publication, and for all his obvious talent as a writer I'm inclined to agree.  The movie is as much a sendup of the original novel as it is a satire of jingoist American politics.  It really is a shame that despite the squeaky-clean heroes plucked straight from the soaps, the Mormon extremists, the multiple-amputee mobile infantry retirees and the propaganda shorts masquerading as news, the vast majority still seems to regard Starship Troopers as a stupid action movie and, for some reason, absolutely refuse to consider that it might be something more.10/10"", 'This film had fantastic potential. Anybody can tell you that this was based on a book written by Robert Heinlein. In truth, however, all Verhoeven got right was that the main character was named Juan ""Johnnie"" Rico, and the enemy was the Bugs. To give this more context, let me add that the book was originally published in 1959. Keep this in mind. The story was written before Vietnam, only six years after the Korean Conflict had drawn to a close...only four years after the publishing of ""The Return of the King"". Remember that when you read all the commentary here about how this movie is a ""Social Commentary"". That is all Verhoeven, not Heinlien. According to the DVD commentary, Paul Verhoeven never finished reading the novel, claiming he read through the first few chapters and became both \'bored and depressed\', the movie\'s message is ""War makes fascists of us all"", and that he sees the movie as a satire of American militarism. Great background research there Paul... The overall theme of the book is that social responsibility requires individual sacrifice. It is the only science fiction novel on the reading list at three of the four United States military academies. The novel was filled with life lessons and examples of the importance of civic duty. More importantly though, it had a REALLY cool element that would have translated very well on film. POWER ARMOR!!!! The book spends loads of time explaining the power armor that made the ""infantry"" the ""Mobile Infantry"". Soldiers didn\'t ride down in boats, they were shot from tubes in capsules (hence the term ""cap trooper""), and their suits looked like a kind of giant mechanical gorilla. Rather than utilize one of the best ideas in the history of science-fiction warfare, Verhoven decided to create ""Space 90210"" and add in his own sophomoric commentary on soldiering and society. Pretty boys and girls in shower scenes might bring in the high-school money, but it certainly doesn\'t make a good movie. If you enjoyed this, I strongly recommend that you read the book. You\'ll know immediately why those of us who did were very disappointed. Fantastic potential, never even close to becoming realized.', 'Brilliant popcorn entertainment. It\'s like they set out to make the best deliberately cheesy, biggest budget B-grade movie ever. The acting is hilariously bad, the writing is sometimes brilliant (particularly the newsreel and recruitment adds) and sometimes horrible, the movie is both deliberately and accidentally funny. This is a classic, a cheesy guilty pleasure.More blood!Edit: I\'ve just watched this again, still bloody fun, still loving ""Do you want to know more?""... even more now as it\'s such a delicious contrast to the disingenuous and already tired ""join the conversation"" out here in the real world.', ""If you think this film is shallow, you're watching it in a shallow way.

I could go on and on about the little details of inaccurateness of the era and props in the movies - tons of 90s looking cell phones and lap tops but this movie is set in 1985-1988 which was clearly indicated 1 min into the movie.', ""Similar in style to Lucy, The girl in the spiders web, Atomic Blonde, Red Sparrow etc but I'd rate this as being one of the better ones.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"[""This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale."", ""The visual effects are amazing. But Cameron should be better than this.I'm a big fan of Mr Cameron. Not only for his directing skills, but also for his screenwriting skills. But this time he seemed to have missed the goal. I know he rarely does sequels. But is this the best he could do? The story has not changed anything compared to the previous episode. Repeated crises, repeated enemies, repeated conflicts,and wait a minute,WHAT? Even repeated Titanic. Are you serious?As a director, he also did not reach his previous level. For a long time, the pace of the film felt too slow. Yes, the underwater scenes are phenomenal. But this is not the Blue Planet, this is a sci-fi action movie. At least it's what most audiences expect from the film, isn't it?"", 'With over a decade of technology improvement, the movie provides even better visuals, more believable CGI(not that the first one didn\'t), it also continues the beautiful cinematography.But, the script is far inferior to the last one. The movie tries to focus on ""family"", and with Jake and Neytiri already had a movie, this one focus heavily on the children. But most of the plot lines fall into the trap of being a set-up for sequels. A few plots left unanswer in the end and a few plots begin after the mid point and already wrap after just after being introduced. Some of the charcaters are downgraded into 1 dimensional and some do not learn anything meaningful throughout the story. And the focus of the movie shifts completely once entered the third act which diminishes all the set-up from before.In conclusion, definitely a must watch, better visuals but slightly worst script.', ""The movie while not fantastic storywise was very enjoyable and well worth going to see it. The visuals where beyond fantastic and makes this years other blockbuster CGI look like a joke. Would recommended strongly seeing it in 3D, while its mostly a novelty that because in most cases its done cheaply as a gimmic. Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all. If your thought is to wait and stream it, save yourself 3hrs and don't bother (unless you have a great home theatre (even then....)"", ""Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have."", 'The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.', ""It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is."", ""I loved how beautiful it was. The CGI and cinematography is a work of art. Also, I saw it in the cinema which everyone should absolutely do! But the plot was such a snooze fest. Just insert any classic sequel plot - here's your hero, they've grown up, have a family, and there are some bad guys, the heroes are threatened, they have to fight back yada yada. I mentally clocked out a couple times only snap back into it and realise nothing had happened. At least the Aussie guy was entertaining.Also it is looooong. So maybe that didn't help things. I can imagine watching this at home with an interval in between and enjoying it more.Go see it for the visuals. Just don't prepare to use your brain understanding the story."", 'If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...', ""Take the movie for what it is, a beautiful story, stunning visuals, and a call for harmony. Just enjoy the ride, it truly is a feet of visual engineering that has never been rivaled. The world building is amazing. The story is not absolutely perfect, the dialogue is rough in spots but the story as a whole makes up for the lack of complex writing. The action sequences are long and complex but they never lost my attention. Definitely one of the best films of the year. I can not wait to see what's next for this series. There are so many options for the future directions of the films. With no doubt, just bye in,"", ""I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money."", ""You don't even need to like the Avatar world or watch the first one. It's a joy to watch. Sea aspect is great. Underwater shots and sea creatures stunning. Unbelievable CGI, miles ahead of all other movies. This time 3-D works much better , l think first Avatar doesn't even need to be 3-D. Emotion and action well balanced. Almost everyone cried, l don't think this is a movie for kids, they all get bored. At the end of the screening there was a short silence and everyone applause like Jim Cameron was there. Believe me he delivers again. Probably first 3 billion dollars box office movie is coming.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the User Rating of Top 250: #192 is absolutely overrated and offensive to the great movies of the cinema history. The IMDb formula may indicate the movies with massive votes and high rating but never the greatest movies of the cinema industry. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Homem de Ferro"" (""Iron Man"")', 'I couldn\'t believe my eyes when I saw how many people rated this pile of crap higher than 3 stars. This has to be the poorest comic book adaptation I\'ve seen since the \'70s Captain America, and that one was actually faithful to the source material. After reading a few comments by those persuaded of this being nothing short than the second coming of Christ, I stumbled on a reviewer that praised the movie for its limited use of CGI. Limited? Sure and I assume last summer\'s Transformers was shot with full scale models animated via stop motion! Anyways let\'s skip to the review.Acting: None of the characters ever felt real at any point in the film. All of the actors just seemed to go along with the lackluster plot for the sake of their paycheck. I don\'t blame them though for they didn\'t really have much to work on in the first place, which takes us to...The Story: Now I am wondering: was anyone actually paid to ""craft"" it or did the producers resort to their dyslexic monkeys writing team once again? Because if realism was what they were aiming for then they pretty much missed the target here. And speaking of it, am I the only one who\'s sick and tired of this trend of putting super heroes into the ""real world"" and having them fight off Islamic terrorists? I mean, was it so hard to have Iron Man squaring it off against one of its arch-nemesis like the Mandarin?The Action: Or should I say ""lack there of""? Seriously whoever goes in the theater expecting to be entertained will be harshly disappointed, \'cause even though the CGI may be appealing and well executed there hardly are more than 5 action sequences in the whole movie (suit testing and final battle included)! The only thing that it\'s worth to mention is the robotic arm that Tony Stark keeps in his basement, for in its scarce screen time, that little articulated mechanical limb succeeds in conveying more personality and genuine emotions than the whole human cast does (or not) in about 2 hours! That cute little fella should be given an award for its performance.Is there anything else to say? Yes, but I think it\'s been amply covered by the other realistic reviewers (i.e. those who rated this 4 stars and less). And yet I\'m puzzled: has mediocrity really replaced the standards for excellence in the mind of the public? Doesn\'t anyone remember the quality of movies of yesteryear?

It can be summarized as ""Keanu gets angry and shoots bad guys"" but what makes it special? Directed by Chad Stahelski who\'s a stunt specialist boy does it show because the main selling point in the film are some real virtuoso action sequences, well made choreographies. Unlike today\'s action movies, it doesn\'t use quick-cuts or shaky cameras actually see what\'s going on.', ""The best way I can describe John Wick is to picture Taken but instead of Liam Neeson it's Keanu Reeves and instead of his daughter it's his dog. That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.As an action movie buff, all I wanted to see in this movie is some inventive action sequences, and I was not disappointed. Every single action sequence in this movie is fast-paced, beautifully shot, fluid, intense, and you never have trouble understanding what's going on. The direction of this film is fantastic, as is the writing. There's no melodramatic soapy story lines - everything is straight and to the point, and the point is to get to the action. Not one moment in this movie is boring. The short dialogue is effective from getting to action sequence A to sequence B without any confusion as to any character's motive. It's all laid out in front of you - all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the insanity happening on screen.Remember when Live Free or Die Hard came out and people were upset that John McClane only fired pistols throughout the entire movie? I like a little versatility when it comes to action heroes, and evidently so do the writers. John Wick wrecks face with pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, knives, even mano-a-mano";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As odd as this seems, I saw ""Invincible"" animation series, and this reminded me of an IRL version of that.The comedy is actually funny and not cheesy or cringy, the superheroes outside of Cena don\'t all look roided to be powerful, and there\'s actually good acting.Marvel is for kids, DC is for adults-hate it but if you\'re honest you\'d agree.', 'The first time I watched The Suicide Squad it was with a number of other people and I have to admit that I really didn\'t get much from it. It was just OKAY to me.A couple of months later, my husband and I watched it and I really listened and paid attention, and I thought it was excellent - apart from the dumb / gratuitous harm to the birds (what the heck was that about, anyway?) and the ridiculous villainous ""thing"" (I won\'t say more in order to avoid a Spoiler tag). The \'twist\' early on, and the comedic flow, especially between Elba and Cena, was fantastic.The thing is, although I normally do not find many movies to be rewatchable, we just got through watching it (for me, a third time) with family, and if anything, I found it even funnier than the last time! My rating of 9, is for the times I laughed just today.', ""I feel like I'm missing something profound but all I can get from this is stupidity. A good movie keeps you from noticing you're watching it. This keeps bringing to mind the same question... What am I watching?"", ""Throughout the movie, the only good part was when Amanda Waller gets whacked in the head. It's not an easy job to make a bad movie with that kind of cast. The whole from start to end is a drag. It was like watching a TV series by skipping episodes. Total dissapointment."", ""This movie is terrible. Maybe it's because I'm unfamiliar with the comic book characters it features, but I fell asleep more than once while watching it. In my experience, that's the hallmark of an awful movie. I'd pass on The Suicide Squad if I were you."", ""I'm happy with this one. You feel more for the characters and it's genuinely a good watch. Peppered with solid laughs throughout.Bonus perks (spoilers): Pete Davidson gets his face shot off and Waller gets clocked for being the dick she is."", ""I can't believe the first S. S. has only 26% on Rotten Tomatoes, and this one is at 92%. If anything, David Ayer's first S. S. was much better written and directed.Don't get me wrong, James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy franchise is one of my favorite super-hero films of all time, but it's the specific lead characters that made it work, especially the humor. Chris Pratt and Dave Bautista, to name a few, made me laugh and cheer them on, along with the awesome Rocket voiced by Bradley Cooper and Groot voiced by Vin Diesel. I've never laughed so hard and had so much fun in any other superhero film. But in this one, the humor and most of the cast trying to be funny, was cringeworthy.Then in this one, Gunn decides to kill off the characters you want to route for right at the start, like Michael Rooker as Savant, and Nathan Fillion as T. D. K., and you're left with Polka Dot dude and John Cena, of whom was a horrible casting choice. I'm a huge fan of Cena, but in comedy, he just doesn't work. None of his jokes came across as funny, and the horrible costume they put him in didn't do him any justice. Sly as King Shark and the amazing Margot Robbie were the only true funny characters. The rest were pretty much clowns trying too hard to make you laugh, and convince you they are superheroes. Idris Elba and Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher 2 - although not meant to be funny, were the only others that were well cast and convincing in their roles. Of course Margot Robbie, as usual, stole the show.Gunn's choice to write and direct this to try and be funny was a cringeworthy flop. What was with the cartoonish flowers and whatnot in that one scene with Harley Quinn? There was just too much infantile nonsense in his writing and directing. Oh, and don't get me started on the one-eyed pink and blue starfish and its babies smh. His story also had way too many plot and technical issues. Some scenes felt rushed, others never-ending, and some totally unnecessary.To me, this was a huge disappointment from the successful and much better first one. If they're going to come out with another one, please go back to David Ayer writing and directing it. At least his story had better continuity and was more cohesive and entertaining, albeit not that much of a comedy, of which I'm just fine with that. I'd rather have zero laughs, than cringeworthy attempts at humor. It's a very generous 7/10 from me."", ""I had such high hopes for this movie. Great director, great cast & a concept (suicide squad) with tons of potential. Yet like so many recent movies, it seems like the writing was done by amateurs. Many of the jokes were elementary school level humor yet the violence and gore were adult. So i ask, just who was this movie meant for???After watching this, the first suicide squad movie looks like a masterpiece. It at least had character development and by the end you could actually care about a few of them. It also had a more coherent, mature and entertaining story. This movie didn't have any of that. It could have still been goofy without being dull if it was written better.Overall a huge disappointment, all i can say is that i'm happy it was on HBOMax because i would have been angry had i paid movie theater prices to go see this garbage."", 'This is the worse movie I have seen in the theatre in a very long time. Is this movie supposed to be irreverent? Is it supposed to be serious? Is it supposed to be both? The movie does not know what it wants to be! This script was horrible! The violence was worrisome. It was disturbing because of the sheer ambivalence of it. I would be concerned about its effects on impressionable minds! Margot Robbie and Viola Davis could not have read much of this script before signing on.', ""Still a little flawed here and there, but it feels like a movie that doesn't try too hard, and if you watch it as such then it serves up plenty. All good fun. Pleasantly surprised."", 'You can tell that everyone involved in this project was having fun and it transfered into the audience.', ""This movie is surprisingly fantastic. Much has been said about it so I want to just add my two cents about universe building in movies. From the very first scene, Suicide Squad made it clear what it was. You understand the world you are in and the rules in place, or lack there of. It then follows those defined rules throughout. Comic book movies can take many forms from gritty realism like Joker all the way to off the wall zany like we see here. As long as the movie follows it's own rules, viewers are willing to go wherever the director wants. What an absolute blast of a good time this one is."", ""The Suicide Squad is an upgrade in every conceivable way when compared to the 2016 movie. Its also a really fun, gory, colorful and fresh take on the DC universe when compared to the dull, dark and overly edgy garbage of Movies like Batman vs Superman. As well as that, its nice to see a cast of characters that would likely never see the light of day in any other DC movie, Polka Dot man being a prime example. The casting itself was also really well done with Daniela Melchior being the standout to me.Overall I loved this movie, it was such a breath of fresh air in, at times, today's over saturated superhero movie genre and I would highly recommend that people go see this film in cinemas for a truly unforgettable experience."", ""So basically, just make a movie of weird people with weird powers, make it somewhat funny and show a lot of gore, and you've got a hit on your hands! I'll stick to watching animation movies, thanks!"", ""I wanted to like this..I like all the others. Great cast, with the exception of Cena. So..why was it so bad.

It doesn\'t happen very often, but we\'re finally at the stage of CGI technology to actually make an effects-intensive movie like this work, and look ""right"". This is a film never designed to win any awards for the script, direction, or acting abilities, yet instead appeal to the crowds as a fun, exciting way to spend one hundred minutes of your life. And with a film like this, the biggest impact comes watching it on the big screen. I\'ve never been a fan of the X-Men comics or television series myself, which is why I was surprised about enjoying this film. The characters are clear cut, easy to identify with and, most of all, extremely cool. For a blockbuster film like this it\'s rare to find characterisation, but (gasp) it does occur here, chiefly with the character of Wolverine, who is given most screen time. Hugh Jackman is excellent in the role, bringing the right balance of instability, anger, love, and honour to his character, and he\'s also very charismatic as well. And that\'s not mentioning the great big bloody spike things which frequently shoot out of his knuckles.The rest of the X-Men are familiar, yet due to there being so many of them, are given little or nothing to do. Storm gets to partake in some spectacular hell-raising moments yet that\'s it. Patrick Stewart is on hand as the wise mentor Professor Charles Xavier, yet is also given little to do aside from roll around in his wheelchair and lapse into unconsciousness at important moments. Anna Paquin puts in a good, heartfelt performance as the shunned Rogue, unable to come into skin contact with another living soul, and we do feel for her situation, but she\'s the only one. Cyclops has great x-ray vision, but when he\'s got his glasses on, he\'s forgettable.The bad guys are a mixed bunch and seemingly possess little in the way of intelligence. And, there\'s only four of them. Sabretooth is a big, hairy and powerful guy, yet just seems like a bigger, inferior version of Wolverine. Ian McKellen, as Magneto, seems a somewhat lame leading bad guy, and the decision to make him a three-dimensional and human villain takes away some of the impact of his character. And the sight of him floating around in a cape is guaranteed to raise the odd chuckle. Mystique is visually arresting as the blue-skinned shape shifter, but most of her tricks have been stolen from the liquid metal man in TERMINATOR 2 and countless ""body snatcher"" films. Finally, Ray Park (better known as the actor under the makeup playing Darth Maul in THE PHANTOM MENACE) is a delight as the purely evil Toad, with a whopping great tongue and the ability to jump about all over the place.For those expecting action, there is actually not that much, aside from the predictable ending. One standout moment has chaos reigning at a train station, but little else in the way of fighting occurs. As this is a 12 certificate film, we never actually see any on screen deaths occur, and there\'s hardly any blood or impact to the violence either - here, it\'s unfortunately glamorised. Wolverine\'s claws are used to impale only a few people (who survive), which is a bit of a cheat. But the biggest cheat of all is the film\'s cop-out ending, predictably paving the way for a sequel, which leaves most of the bad guys alive and the fate of the others unknown.This film is definitely worth watching for the special effects alone, as they easily surpass the overdone nature of the ones in something like THE PHANTOM MENACE. They\'re also almost constantly on screen, and most effective when they occur in ""normal"" situations when you don\'t expect them. My particular favourite was when one unfortunate man dissolved into water, or a moment where one character squeezes between cell bars and has his eyes bulge out alarmingly. And then there\'s all manner of comic-book explosions, lightning, lasers, and big clouds of vaguely threatening white stuff (no, I have no idea what it was supposed to be either). The only complaints come from the occasionally poor editing and the open-endedness of the finale. Otherwise this is well worth a watch and a nice, satisfying piece of light entertainment.', ""X-Men is first superhero team movie in history. Also it is Marvel's first movie with a high budget. Movie is amazing about storytelling, especially in first one hour. I really liked the world they created. But then it becomes a bit meaningless and complicated. CGI's are good for 2000. Actors and actresses are awesome with their roles, every one of them. This film have some surprising scenes, especially with Mistique. Bryan Singer made a good job at all."", 'A neat start to what I hear is a pretty popular Marvel series. It was a pretty straight forward action packed flick that featured some neat effects for it\'s fairly early time it hit theaters. Stuart, McKellen, Jackman and the rest of the bold crew were all portrayed as rare mutants that walk amongst society. A pretty straight-forward storyline throughout the film as the team of mutants known as X-Men try to protect and rescue one of their newer and younger ones from ""the dark side"" of mutants, with one of the helpers being a new member of the X-men as well. This saga introduction shall continue.', 'Though ""X-Men"" starts slowly, the slow buildup and great payoff proved that this film is worthy of the successful franchise it spawned.', 'X-Men surprised me with its intelligence, marvelous direction, and wonderful characters.A startlingly fun movie to watch, X-Men is one of the better comic book adaptations out there. In fact, I\'d say it was the best one made until Spider-Man came out. Even then, it\'s a close call. X-Men does really well with balancing the terrific number of characters it features on screen. I think this is the movie\'s best aspect. It gives us a lot of depth to every character on screen. Including Wolverine, who I was not pleased with when I saw X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It\'s a little ironic that there was more depth given to Wolverine in a film that was not strictly about Wolverine than the ""character study"" film did that was supposed to be solely about Wolverine. I started to feel an interesting connection to this character. This is incredibly important because this is the first time I had ever thought much of anything for Wolverine, including in other films, TV shows, and comic books. Excellent development.I was even more impressed with some of the side characters, like Rogue. Rogue was portrayed beautifully by Anna Paquin. I was unprepared for the level of intensity that this young actress was able to bring to the table with her character. She seemed frail, but independent. Strong and weak at the same time. And there was so much emotional strength given to her that by the time we got to the climactic battle, I was genuinely concerned for her. I also really loved the friendship that was played out between her and Wolverine. It was done extremely well and the two shared some really impressive scenes.Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Grey were a little underplayed, but I was still satisfied with the level of character development that we still got from them. I was able to take all these characters seriously and I was able to follow each of their own inner struggles in a way that, again, I had not anticipated.Ian McKellen was yet another surprise for me as Magneto. I had never held much stock in the villain, believing him to be nothing particularly special. And when I saw the old man who was to play him, I couldn\'t hold back my scoff. But the surprises kept coming through and I couldn\'t help but love this guy\'s performance. He plays the villain Magneto very well, giving a powerful and poignant performance. That\'s nothing to scoff at.And while I am talking about the actors and characters, I cannot forget Patrick Stewart who played Professor Xavier. I think this was the best performance in the film. Patrick Stewart really brought this character to life, giving the audience an incredibly powerful performance. There was a scene when he was talking to Wolverine and Cyclops and I suddenly realized I was leaning forward in my chair to hang onto every word this guy had to say. A brilliant and underrated performance.Then there were the incredible visuals in this story. Whether they were all CGI or not I did not know and neither did I care. This film was still made before everything had gone to such gargantuan lengths in the computers and I could tell the effort that was put into the visuals. And they looked really darn good.But what impressed me still more than anything else about X-Men was the direction. This film was directed by Bryan Singer, and he gives the audience some really intense direction. I was blown away by the cinematography among everything else. Singer is a wonderful director. I haven\'t seen any of his other films, but I want to now.X-Men is an entertaining and--above everything else--fun ride that is sure to grasp comic book fans and non-comic book fans alike.9/10', 'I thought this film couldve been a little more developed (even for a assumed prequel) considering the circumstances of it being a movie based on one of the best comic books ever.  Still, there are many things to like in this film.  The action, the characters, the visual and special fx and someother things.  It is a must see, but fans of the comic book might be a little confused of the characters being kinda young (Rogue in this film is a teen and in the comic book series she is an adult) and being under-developed. Note- look for Ray Park (Darth Maul) as Toad.  A-', 'I knew about the ""X-Men"" graphic novels but never read them. Although I did find the movie fairly interesting, mainly because it shows how Sen. Kelly (Bruce Davison) tries to create a McCarthy-style fear of mutants. I guess that for the most part, this movie is not much different from other superhero movies, but worth seeing as a cultural reference. It was surprising to see Ian McKellen go from ""Gods and Monsters"" to this. A particularly funny scene is when Cyclops (James Marsden) has to verify Wolverine\'s (Hugh Jackman) identity. This movie does make one grow to respect mutants.So why do you ask questions to which you already know the answer?', '""X-men"" is a well done sci-fi action film for all action fans: especially for those who as kids dreamed of having special powers themselves. Each of the main mutant characters has a special ability and during the film I sometimes found myself thinking about which of those abilities I would choose if I were given the chance. Of course all of those special abilities are visible in the film\'s spectacular special effects. But the special effects were not the only thing that made watching this film fun. There is also plenty of action and character interaction besides shooting and beating and using special powers. As each mutant character is given a past (to give him a motivation) and a weakness, the film\'s plot never got boring because I also wanted to know how things developed between the mutants themselves.And I won\'t even talk about the ending. It actually surprised me. But go see for yourself', 'It is a great challenge to make the first episode of a superhero series, why? You have the pressure of making it believable, entertaining, dramatic, exciting, you know what...Bryan Singer, hands down, he is a great director, x-men is a hit, and without the action sequences you would expect from a movie of this kind, he keeps your full attention, but not for long enough.The minutes fly by and suddenly you will find yourself hoping for something exciting to happen, and it will, but by that the movie has reached almost its conclusion.Good thing that there is a sequel, that it works very good thanks to this first act, not a bad thing, right??? 8 out of 10.', ""How is this a good movie?  Maybe if you were into the comic books, a movie of it would seem like a cool thing, and then you just don't want to admit that the movie is pretty bad.  It was not an engaging story at all after they left Poland in the beginning.  You kept expecting something that would to grab your attention, but it never came.  The ending was pretty lame, and it seemed like the last 3rd of the movie was just setting up for the sequel. I never really understood what the story was.  I was expecting much better things.  Too bad for Bryan Singer after doing two very good movies (or at least one very good, then one not-quite-as-good)"", ""I find X-men a good start to the x-men franchise since it brings the characters we all know in love from the comics or even the old animated TV show of x-men with people like the wolverine, jean grey or mystique, all of which we know from the comics and I get why some people say now that it doesn't really have good CGI anymore but in my opinion I honestly think that it still has good animation till this day. I give X-men 2000 10/10 stars, For its good story and how they put such good casting in this movie.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I really did. Anything novel and not Marvel. But, unfortunately, this movie was dark, slow and not engaging. It started off with the harsh power of humanity to endure hardship and to impose it, but then went flat with the story. Nothing to learn, no one to love or hate, nothing to make you a character. Not intending the ultimate insult, but perhaps it is: you never forget you're watching a movie. You don't become one with it. However, it could win an Academy award for the production or costumes, but none of that makes up for a dark, slow and non-engaging story."", ""I hadn't realized this film was directed by Robert Eggers, else I would've been better prepared. It's not what I expected, and it was hard to really get into.That said, I can appreciate the film for its art. I would say it's a gem for cinephiles. It's like viewing the imagination of a medieval Viking peasant as he listens to a bard tell the tale of Amleth.Great for what it is, but does not evoke emotional connection to the characters, and therefore feels less satisfying."", ""This is not a viking version of Die Hard. This isn't an M. Night Shyamalan movie with a cute twist. It's absolutely not a movie with modern sensibilities.This is a tale in the style of an epic myth. It showcases classic themes of betrayal, vengeance, and sacrifice through a brutal mix of realism and symbolism.It's unapologetically not for everyone. And it's bloody fantastic."", ""POSITIVES:1) The performances are (mostly) terrific. I thought Anya Taylor-Joy especially was marvellous and added most of the emotional depth to the film\n2) The score is first class and really adds to lots of the already epic scenes, especially the action scenes. The cinematography was also superb and helps a lot in this area too.3) I respected the film for trying to go deeper with its themes and bringing religion and spirituality into the picture, rather than just being a mindless action filmNEGATIVES:1) Nicole Kidman was terribly cast in my opinion. It's not even really her fault, but whenever she was on screen it took me out of the film because I just saw Nicole Kidman. Also, her Scandinavian accent was truly atrocious\n2) The 'twist' that Amleth's mother was actually a villain was just so obvious to me and I think to everybody else too. It bothered me that the film seemed to hang so much dramatic weight in this 'reveal'\n3) The film could certainly have done with restructuring and managing its time better. There are lots of scenes present that I felt were unnecessary. Instead, I could have done with some more explanations and exposition, because there are lots of things that the film just expected me to get on board with. For example, witches are just real and nobody questions it? How can Amleth have visions of his own family tree? How did touching her blood make Amleth foresee that Anya Taylor-Joy was going to give birth to his twins? How could Amleth see himself being ridden into heaven on a horse?"", 'This is probably the only Viking-related entertainment I have ever watched to thoroughly respect and appreciate our heritage. What a fantastic cast, cinematography and blend of realism and the supernatural. Absolutely masterfully crafted.Netflix and Marvel can try their best to ruin the image of my ancestors. All I can say is thank god for Eggers and The Northman.', 'Where do I start? No real drama. No character development. The most cornball dialogue. Sloppy plot. Poor use of a potentially spectacular landscape. Bland soundtrack. I think any episode of VIKINGS would surpass this film. I was blown away by how ordinary it was and almost walked out. It was cinema by numbers that added up to far less than its parts. This film should have been absolutely epic. Terribly disappointing. It was well over two hours of boredom. Anyone claiming it a masterpiece should be banned from entering Valhalla!', ""This film is so unique and brilliant. We've never seen a nordic mythology movie so accurate. Loved the cast, acting was top notch.Robert Eggers Is quickly becoming the director of the decade. Every movie he makes is a fresh take with his own style.And finally I movie in the 2020's that isn't bogged down by the token person of color or strong do it herself female role that weighs down the actual plot. Kudos to Robert for keeping his vision and making the best film I've seen all year."", ""My impression of this film is that they shot a few cool viking scenes - and decided to make a story around it and just sew it together.Starts of pretty awkward then moves on to some cool raiding then it's back to awkward drama and weird scenes. Then it's a lot of fight talking then it's drama again. Then it's hallucinations and finally the movie ends.Alexander is a BEAST but the movie is so poorly edited and the story is.... Predictable.Beautiful scenery but... I nearly fell asleep."", 'On its face, The Northman is stark and naked, which is perfect in relation to the film itself and the story it intends to tell.

I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.I hope my talk helps."", 'I haven\'t written a comment on IMDb for about 3 years but was inspired to with this film. It is not very often that I come across a film by accident (World Movies on cable) and the spend the next day scouring the internet to find out information about it and can\'t get it out of my head! Anyway, yep there are plot holes, but Old boy borrows a lot from surrealism and you are meant to suspend your disbelief! I don\'t buy comments when people say ""it is so unrealistic because he should\'ve done this ..."" because it is a surrealist film and meant to be unrealistic! For me the sign of a good film is if it sticks on your head! THis one surely does (althought I did have to look away a few times ... ) Loved it!!!! Work of cruel genius!!! (HOLLYWOOD - Please don\'t ruin it by remaking it!!!)', ""I've scored this a 9 but I think I may have been a little harsh! I have just read a review that says the reviewer cannot understand the hype. I can see no hype. Everything the film promised and more was delivered. This is a truly wonderful film. It is beautifully acted, brutally and painstakingly directed and as good a display of raw emotion as I have witnessed in any language. The story is gripping, the characters believable and well rounded, the emotion human and the feeling I was left with at the end of the film is one of awe. And that was after I had watched it twice. Honestly, this is a truly, truly wonderful film. Do not miss it under any circumstances!"", ""Oldboy really is an odd movie. It's totally unconventional, completely original, and unlike anything else you'll probably find out there, even in the realms of Asian cinema. To say too much would be to spoil the ride, but this is a film where you'll always be guessing what's going to happen next and never quite sure what's really going on.It's a bleak, dark movie that begins very well indeed and stays strong throughout. Chan-wook Park is an expert director and really handles everything well. He's blessed with a superior leading man in Choi Min-sik, the kind of actor who gives his all to the movie, no restraint, no mild-mannered acting here...he lives and breathes the role and you believe in him at all times. Kang Hye-jeong, starring opposite him as love interest Mido, is also very effective, completely lovely and just right for her role.As for the story... wow. This movie has a brilliant script that constantly surprises you right up until the very last scene. Twists are commonplace these days, but the one found here is the most shocking I've ever seen. OLDBOY has it all, really. A great story unveiled in a leisurely way, piece by piece, no hurry. Touches of the surreal – the disgusting octopus-eating scene is everything you'd imagine it to be. Great acting, great technical aspects. There's violence too, of course. The tooth-pulling torture is probably the most squirm-inducing bit, but the highlight for me is the one-take corridor battle which has to be seen to be believed. One guy with a hammer versus twenty hoods...well, watch it and find out what happens.By the time the ending comes and you find out why Oh Dae-su was imprisoned, you realise you're watching a masterwork of cinema. It's not an easy film to sit through by any means, but it is affecting and it is very well made indeed. Challenging, gut-punching and outrageous: OLDBOY is one of the bad boys of our time."", ""Imagine what you'd do, when you wake from a bad dream, to find you're held by four square walls, for as long as someone deems, no idea why you're trapped, what you've done, why you're kidnapped, just a ceaseless line of dumplings going down your gyoza hatch. Now some fifteen years have passed, every question has been asked, and you're suddenly set free, can start your own avenging spree, before you do you need to feed, by eating something that's in need, so an octopus is ordered, and head first you cross the borders. But things aren't what they might seem, tied and tethered and undreamed, as the puppet master hovers, manipulates what you'll discover.Some films you cannot watch too often and this is one of the greatest pieces of cinematic brilliance ever created."", 'Armond White of the NY Press has called it a ""virtuosic stupid movie"". I think that\'s exactly right.Certainly the movie looks fantastic. I liked the surrealistic touches. I think the director has a real imaginative way of capturing the process of memory -- there\'s an extended flashback about 3/4 way through which I think is as well conceived and shot as anything I\'ve seen. The acting is standout. Hell, I even liked the score.But the movie almost aggressively makes no sense.SPOILERS Leave aside for a moment the obvious plot holes, large and small -- although it\'s worth noting that there\'s a whole lot of them. Leave aside the contrivances, too: the endless special gadgets the bad guy comes up with just when he needs them, the rather magical view of hypnosis, Dae-Su\'s magical new abilities, the seeming omnipotence of the badguy. Let\'s assume all this is beside the point, and that we\'re supposed to take the movie more or less symbolically ala FIGHT CLUB (probably the closest reference).The movie doesn\'t make any sense thematically, either. What\'s it really about? The virtue of keeping your mouth shut? The movie seems to suggest that the bad guy\'s sexual relationship with his sister is just fine, the problem seems to be Dae-Su\'s big mouth. The movie rather laboriously teaches this: the sister kills herself because of the rumors which somehow the sister believes to be true (?)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This story won't stay with me as a memorable piece of art. But I enjoyed it for what ir is, and had a good time. Go in with that level of expectations and you wont be disappointed! Value for money."", 'The Great Wall surprised me a lot, and I believe that the fact that I watched the movie without expecting anything was important, I had no expectations, I had seen only 1 trailer and I went to see, I liked it a lot, first that the battles are good Made, the CGI is quite competent, obviously the battle is not Lord of the Rings level, but they are good, the soundtrack is good, the cast works, the characters are interesting, the movie sins in the script and the rhythm has problems, The film owes much to the battle that manages to bring a great entertainment, but if it were not for them the movie would be annoying, The Great Wall is a cool movie and worth watching. Note 6.7', 'Matt Damon, given his predicament and the backlash of being a white person cast in a move that was based in China, still gave a great performance. The plot was nothing special, but I throughly enjoyed the concept. The cinematography was beautifully shot and the colors throughout the movie make it very pleasing to the eyes. Without the camera work, this would not be a good movie. I think this movie is still worth a watch.', 'When I was little, in Romania, I saw about three Chinese films, all made in that imbecile communist period, very very hard to see. This Chinese production (also with some American, Australian and Canadian help) is not even close to what were those idiotic propaganda films. As I said in the review for ""Kong: Skull Island"", ""Kong: Skull Island"" and ""The Great Wall"" they have something in common. And I do not mean only the actress Jing Tian, present in both and Legendary Entertainment, as one of the producing companies for both films. I refer in particular the monsters and the ""very special""(I mean, very good) special effects. They look very well in both movies. I liked Matt Damon more in ""Jason Bourne"" and ""The Martian"" but he\'s OK here too. The whole film is OK. Tian Jing is distinguished and sweet.', ""The famous Great Wall was built to keep out the evil hordes: people with a lot of problems, drug dealers, murderers rapists, and (I assume) some good people. Wait a minute, wrong wall. Regardless, The Great Wall embraces a new direction currently seen in filmmaking. Many movies, like Transformers 4, have featured Chinese locations prominently with the hope of getting into Chinese theaters. The rules to get into Chinese theaters are long and complex and the rules as to how much money an American studio can make from those theaters is even more complex. So, US-Chinese co- productions like The Great Wall could become the rule rather than the exception.Consequently, the story behind how a movie like The Great Wall gets produced, is way more interesting than the movie itself. The Great Wall is movie where things happen not out of natural plot development or character motivations, things happen because the script says they happen.The best example of this lack of plot development is the revelation that the creatures made it to the other side of the wall. How they accomplish this daunting feat is neither explained nor shown to the audience. Suddenly, a guard tells Matt Damon that it's happened and that's that. Perhaps the creatures paid a toll?Speaking of which, the creatures and main villain of this movie are simply put ugly green poorly rendered computer dogs. Not creepy ugly like the Predator or Alien. Just ugly ugly. Additionally, they express no motivation or intelligence for their machinations beyond the need to get food for their queen. That's the limit of their complexity, this from the main antagonists throughout the movie.I guess I could go into Willem Dafoe's role in the movie, but then I'd quickly be doing more work on his character than the script did. Further, Matt Damon's character has a friend (played by Pedro Pascal) that travels with him throughout the story whose contribution is nearly non-existent.In fact, one could streamline this script and tell the same story with just Matt Damon's character and a selection of random guards. One could argue that all the extra story lines and characters are red herrings. However, that would imply that these elements at one time seem important. They never do. The movie is nothing more than generic throwaway monsters versus shallow throwaway heroes.Sadly enough, some good ideas are here. For instance, to signal how they'll attack the creatures the soldier use drumbeats to unify their action quickly. This is not only a nifty military technique, but, more importantly, provides a good driving bass to the action and, unfortunately, is criminally underused here. The use of color on the Chinese soldiers is frequently beautiful. However, the way they attack the amassing hordes from the wall swiftly ranges from very cool to very stupid.Presumably, they could create a decent video game from this movie, which brings us full circle to the techniques movie makers embrace to make money.I watched trailers for this movie and although I didn't expect great art, I did think it could be dumb fun. Well, I was half right."", ""Ascinating! Unlike anything I've seen before, and thoroughly entertaining at that. Spectacular visuals. Obviously heavy on CGI, but boy, is it entertaining and a visual feast! One thing, though, the film would have been better without Willem Dafoe's character, who is passive and only there when he is really needed, otherwise does not really serve a purpose. The lack of consideration for the killing off of Matt Damon's friends in the film is also a bit worrying, as if they're soul-less creatures.If you're not into monsters, though, you might want to give this one a skip."", ""Anyone who is saying that this movie is anything but awful, then they have absolutely no taste in movies, or grand expectations, or any feasible amount of credibility to tell you what a good movie is. The CGI is laughable. The story is laughable, the acting is laughable, the over all premise and execution of this movie is completely laughable. After reading so many TEN star ratings an ranting about how wonderful this film is, one wonders if they are getting paid or were involved or just plain high as a kite, or simply wouldn't know good cinema if it bit them in the bum. But then again, i've heard people rave about how great sharknado is. So maybe after claiming something like sharknado is cinematic mastery, then one can understand why anyone would watch this and think it is anything but a waste of time AND MONEY to view such crap on the silver screen. Don't believe my review. Simply watch this Hollywood drivel for yourself and come to terms with not listening to just one reviewer that gave this thing a 1 star rating. Only regret is not being able to give it a minus rating. It's bad folks. Just horrible."", 'This film tells the story of two Western men who goes to China in search of gunpowder. They enter the Middle Kingdom with the foot of a beast they have killed, hoping to make a bargain with the Chinese for gunpowder. Instead, they get into a big adventure with monstrous beasts that nothing could have prepared them for.I was really skeptical about ""The Great Wall"", because the last film I watched that was made for the Chinese market was horrible. ""The Great Wall"", on the other hand, pleasantly surprised me because it surpassed my expectations with flying colours. The plot is tight, thrilling and well paced. I am so happy to see Chinese actors and actresses taking positive roles. Even the Hong Kong superstar Andy Lau is only having a supporting role in this film! In addition, I was not expecting Jing Tian\'s English to be as good as that. She had a mostly non speaking role in ""Kong Skull Island"", so I thought it was because of the language barrier. The battle scenes against the beasts are plentiful, and the scenes are thrilling and draws me in like a magnet. I cannot wait to see what happens next. The grand finale is breathtaking, both visually and literally. I enjoyed it a lot.', 'There are awesome movies on one side while dreadful movie on the other and then there is this decent movie. The concept in this movie was at large not much different from LOTR but the director along with the writers, portrayed the magnificence of The Great Wall in a great fashion through a great angle view of the wall, through enemy creatures and the army itself which is refreshing rather than going on and on about the size of the wall (which is quite common these days in numerous movies and extremely annoying). Also there was this sprinkle of light but good jokes which captures the mood.Thus the movie in a nutshell was decent and entertaining.', 'i heard all the bad critique levied against this film, and it was almost by accident that i wound up watching it.Matt Damon is a ruff n gruff explorer / mercenary in vaguely- historical ancient china.

Had promise but got wasted on lazy storytelling, and two characters who are amusing but then quickly I was feeling smothered by. Margaret Qualley and Geraldine Viswanathan are talented, and have good chemistry, but the problem is I wish they where better written, Qualley overacts and Viswanathan under acts. Other actors who I will not name come in and do very little here. This movie is a trainwreck.', ""I wanted to like this, really have never seen a Coen movie that wasn't good... until this one. It has some funny moments, no doubt, but they were pretty few and far between.Possibly some of this flew over my head, as I'm not a member of the lesbian community, but again just not my thing.I thought the criminals were fairly funny and the two leads had some moments, but I really wish we got more high quality comedies in this day and age. Too few and the ones that get here are usually meh.If you want a good Coen brothers comedy, checkout burn after reading, it's hilarious. Really wish this was better, but it's way too uneven."", ""I have loved nearly every Coen brothers films ever made, and my favorite No Country for Old Men is in my top 5 EVER. I just can't believe how bad this film is. I thought Margaret Qualley was fantastic in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. I thought she had a really big career ahead of her. She has had some more good performances, and then this. I am not sure what she was trying to achieve here, but she failed miserably. That fake Texas drawl was appallingly bad. I realize Matt Damon, and Pedro Pasqal were just in short, quick roles, but why would they waste their time. I guess maybe a favor to Ethan ,!I am so confused about what Ethan Coen was trying for here. Sarcastic- fail. .. Dark- fail...\nIronic-fail...cheesy-fail\nCertainly not very funny either."", ""The Coen Brothers are a duo that has made some of the best movies out there, but I haven't been as big of a fan when they do things on their own. They seem to have a spark when they work together, but I'll always watch anything either of them is a part of. Drive-Away Dolls is Ethan Coen's latest directorial effort and I had a really good time watching it, but I'm not sure if I'll ever properly process it. There's just something about it that I wasn't expecting and I'm not sure if that added or took away from it. Still, if you're ready to be surprised, in a dirty, sexual way, then I recommend Drive-Away Dolls, and here's why.Needing a break from her reality, Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan) decides to take a road trip to Tallahassee, Florida, along with her friend Jamie (Margaret Qualley), who just recently had a break-up and has nowhere to live. The two of them rent a car and hit the road, only to realize they have a briefcase with something crazy inside, the head of a dead man, and they may possibly even be falling in love with each other along the way. That's all I can say about this film without giving too much away because I genuinely did not expect where this film goes or what was in that briefcase. The reveal of what is in there and what it relates to is one of the funniest reveals I've seen in a while, so that made for a good time at the movies, but I do think this film (aside from the humour and clever writing), is one-note.Drive-Away Dolls is a film (like I said) that has great dialogue, but that's to be expected from Ethan Coen. My issue is that even though the dialogue is quippy and solid, a lot of the same humour is repeated and a lot of the same scenarios as well. That shouldn't be the case when the film itself is only 84 minutes long. The film is riddled with sexual humour and inclusive lingo throughout the entire runtime, which was all good, it's just that the film didn't have anything else to say aside from that. I really enjoyed what was on screen in that regard, don't get me wrong, but I felt that was the only style of humour here. Still, it was a fun time.If you've watched the trailers, you've had every single cameo spoiled for you, which was a bit of a letdown in my opinion, even though the reason for their cameos was brilliant. I also loved the lame editing style here that was clearly done on purpose. Cheesy transitions and random psychedelic imagery definitely made me ask what I was actually watching, but I liked it. Nothing about this film is what I expected and I think that's why I ended up liking it because it's otherwise slightly repetitive. When all is said and done, Drive-Away Dolls is worth seeing if you're up for clever humour and a lot of sexual dialogue and visuals. It's now playing in theatres and I had a good time overall."", ""I laugh at anything, even movies with toilet humor and absurd amount of unnecessary vulgarity are some of my favorites as long as they're funny. I loved the work of the 3 main actresses in previous movies and had high hopes for Drive Away Dolls, but I was very disappointed.The story had potential, but something along the line of unconvincing acting and poor editing made the film pretty confusing annd I pretty much lost any interest in the evolution of the story and had compassion to any of the characters. It felt much longer than its relatively short run time.The main focus of the film- the severed penis-really wasn't funny. It went for far too long and it really cheapened the movie. The jokes seemed calculated and unnatural.It's a forgettable movie."", ""This maybe had 45-50 minutes worth of content and it made 84 minutes feel long. The script needed a lot of work and I'm shocked Ethan Coen released something this half baked.There are a few moments of enjoyment but, they are few and far between. They went for a campy feel but I never found Qualley's performance convincing and Viswanathan came off more wooden than intended. The side characters had more funny moments and funny performances than the leads.On the plus side, the last 10-15 minutes were thoroughly entertaining. It's like they had an ending in mind and worked backwards from there. It failed miserably to build something worthy of the idea and had some unintentional cringeworthy moments."", ""I had a good time watching this one. The characters are a true highlight here, and the two leads contrast each other well. Jamie being the most lovable of the two, and Marian has the most emotional depth to her. The cameos were also well-casted, so even though you spend maybe three minutes meeting those characters, you can understand what kind of person they are without needing the exposition. Nobody ever feels like they're being talked down to or reduced to a stereotype. The humor is on-point, even when there are uncomfortable moments you can't help but chuckle a little bit at the circumstances.The one critique I have is that there are a lot of psychedelic cutaways and transitions that (save for one specific one, you'll know when you see it) seem like pure filler. The movie is way too short, I would pay to see a whole series of Mariam and Jamie going on little escapades a là Poker Face. Missed potential there. It's a short, sweet, fun movie! This is one of those movies that doesn't need it, but I really hope they make a sequel!"", ""This movie is not for everyone, in fact there a lot of possible turn offs. It's basically a whole lot of sex jokes, condensed in a movie. Still, there is enough to like. The unique transitions, paired with some enjoyable characters will probably make you snicker a couple of times. The overall story is okish, but won't keep you philosophising at night, except if you're contemplating the perks of being a lesbian I guess.The highlight of this movie is the part in which Pedro Pascal performs the best cartoonesk run I have ever seen. Truly a performance for the ages.All in all, fun enough if you're looking for a brain snack, not a must see."", 'This is probably one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. I desperately wanted to leave after 40 minutes but stayed hoping it would get better. It did NOT. Don\'t waste your time or money.From the unconnected psychedelic scenes that had NOTHING to do with the movie, the unnecessary sex scenes and the CONSTANT sex talk took away anything good about this movie. The acting was atrocious. The lame Texas ""accident"" was awful and her dialect coach (if she had one) should be ashamed. The fact that they were able to get Pedro, Miley and Matt to make appearances is BEYOND my comprehension. This movie is not even remotely funny.', ""I like quirky off beat comedies, but once you eliminate the sex scenes and the goofy 70's music graphic scene there really is no movie. Margaret Quallay is supposed to be the primary comedic character, but she did not work for me. The Arliss and Flint relationship could have been good, but there was never an attempt to develop it. I found myself wondering if during the preview is an actor like Matt Damon proud of this movie or is it simply a fast buck. After the movie I look to my wife and said i was going to ask you if you wanted to leave on 3 occasions to which she replied I wish you had. The only good thing about this movie was it was only 84 minutes."", 'I think the biggest problem with this movie is the trailer paints a different movie. The case is very important to the story, but it\'s definitely in the backseat while the love story rides shotgun and the buddy/roadtrip movie is in the driver\'s seat.Qualley is always great and it\'s no different here, she\'s doing a lot of the heavy lifting to keep the movie going and stole every scene.Viswanathan is delightful as her more reserved counterpart, she is the ""straight-man"" of the comedic duo and she\'s just right for the part.Joey Slotnick was a very pleasant surprise, he went all-in playing a bumbling tough guy and he plays so well off of Wilson.The movie has some parts that don\'t make a ton of sense, it\'s got a few scenes that could\'ve been tweaked, (Jamie doesn\'t even check the case Matt Damon hands over) but overall it was such a fun ride and Marian and Jamie were a ton of fun.', ""The Coen Brothers have made some of my all time favorite movies. I went into this film with high hopes. The trailers looked amazing. Unfortunately, the trailers contained most of the decent parts of the film. The main story line was extremely weak. I guess it was supposed to be funny, but it wasn't. It was extremely unbelievable, and they could have thought of a million better stories. One of the actors looked so much like JB Smoove, I was extremely confused if it was him in makeup. Also, they threw in some big name actors with completely pointless roles.If you go into this movie with zero expectations, and without seeing the trailer, you may enjoy it. I had high hopes, and walked away very let down."", ""You can tell when people are having fun making a movie. Ethan Cohen brings us a wacky premises and a spectacular cast in Drive-Away Dolls. Its a world that is absurd but grounded. Its the reality we live in skewed just a bit of centered. From the opening you know its not a perfect movie. It entertains and visually captures you with strange editing choices. The cast ia fun and unders what they need to accomplish. The two leads are fantastic and control the narrative beautifully you are rooting for these idiots the whole time. If you are bored and want to support director's who take big swings watch this movie. I beg people to watch weird movies more often."", ""Where is Joel when you need him? This was one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. Maybe my hopes were too high, being a Coen film. I am not sure why Ethan is so enamored with gratuitous lesbian sex with zero-character development. It just speaks to poor writing skills. I loved Margaret Quailey in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood but in this film by Ethan Coen, she is placed in a one-dimensional box with no opportunity for her character to have depth or meaning. I understand this film was billed as a quirky comedy, Burn After Reading is a quirky comedy, not Drive-Away Dolls. My hope is that Ethan will once again collaborate with his brother Joel for another intriguing witty film like they have produced so many times in the past."", ""I saw Drive_Away Dolls, starring Margaret Qualley-Poor Things, The Leftovers_tv";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As I read another reviewer state, it's a great watch it and forget it type of move. Entertainment for the sake of entertainment! Having said that, there is the reminder of the importance of family and the struggles of raising teenagers. They hit a few of these points spot on. Make more of these types of movies so I can enjoy them with the family please."", ""While this is not a movie where you'll be amazed by the plot it sure delivers on both action and comedy fronts and sometimes that's all we need from a movie: to spend a good time laugfhingh and see good action.A popcorn movie? Sure, but in a wold where,m save a few exceptions, most movies are very slow burns with crap characters only defined by their gender or secuality I'm just hjappy to see a movie that is just a movie.It has heart too, Michele Monagan never disapoints and even Mark Whalberg does a hreat job as the father figure.A fun ride throug and through, jighly recommended in these dark times as we all deserve to crack a laugh."", ""This was a cute movie, where Marky Mark (also producer here) is in a physical shape that is truly exceptional, and married to a beautiful wife with only a very civilized age gap. There's product placement, but not too much. There's staggering violence, but it's all squeaky clean so it can be a Xmas movie. All the supporting cast is ethnic just the right amount. The family is flush with tremendous cash, which helps plot advancement as well as beautiful cinematography / scenes.It was very enjoyable, assuming enough suspension of disbelief. The whole thing is obviously very predictable, but it's executed nicely. Everybody but the teenage daughter is world-class level at something, so while it's promoting family values, it is, for a change, not promoting mediocrity.I watched this while cycling indoors, was perfect to get me through my winter workout."", ""So there was some money left and no ideas. How easy is it just to remake a high scoring film but without the large budget. This is so copied from True Lies, even the main character has the same job and there is also the evil Asian woman. The ending with a show out against the baddies in an empty building, same. Between the first and last act there is the road trip ala National Lampoon's Vacation and it feels as boring as the real trip possibly would be. A few scenes are inserted to show how the kids and parents are growing to eachother. The film is trying to copy the light hearted touch of True Lies but fails. Is it a bad film? No surprisingly it is entertaining enough to sit along, mainly due to the main characters Mark Wahlberg and the amazing Michelle Monaghan. It's an actrice I don't see much, but she does a great job and it feels there is chemistry between both persons. And Mark Wahlberg never changes and I still love this guy for his commitment."", ""Reading the negative audience reviews here, it's as if many of the people decided to watch The Family Plan without any idea about what they might get with a Mark Wahlberg, family-oriented action-comedy. This ain't Oppenheimer, folks. My wife and I had zero expectations when we tuned in and this movie more than surpassed the low bar we had set. It was cute, funny, and mildly action-oriented, with better than expected acting and a few moments that were actually pretty funny and heart-warming. If you're looking for a potential Oscar nominee, you're looking in the wrong place. But, if you want to pass a few hours and walk away with a smile on your face (like the adorable baby in this movie), you really won't go wrong with The Family Plan."", ""The Family Plan becomes very tiresome fast with it's long run time and generic plot/comedy/action. Nothing is special from this film presented by Apple. Mark Wahlberg tries his best here but can't save this film from sinking even though he stars and is a Executive Producer on. What is also dissapointing is the acting is very bad from everyone involved which is a surprise especially since this is a solid cast. Without spoiling to much of the plot point this reminded me of a cheap knockoff of True Lies in a way. You will know what I'm talking about when you watch this. The Family Plan gets failing grade from me with 4 stars out of 10."", 'Oh come on. Some people took this movie way too seriously with their ridiculously low ratings. It is what it is with no pretentious ""deeper meaning"". This was a fun ride. A goofy at times holiday treat. Yes, you could probably predict some of what was coming, but so what. The cast was great. And so many other fun characters in the entire movie. The baby was so cute and hysterical at times. This is a sit back with popcorn and laugh movie. If you just want to relax and enjoy a movie that is not stuffed with obligatory ""stuff"" and divisive messaging, this is it. It is entertainment. Don\'t take it too seriously.', 'Mark Wahlberg seems to have developed a knack for leading family movies.

Apple wanted another movie (not that they made two movies over the last months for cinema) so the writers thought: wow let's make a funny romantic family action road trip drama movie, man I don't even know how many genres we want to integrate into this movie but it's gonna be awesome! And I have to say the first act isn't that bad. I quiet liked it actually, even if it was a little bit brainless. But what followed was a story that couldn't have been more boring. I don't want to see the classic ending shot where the protagonists walk out of a building with the police already waiting. I want to see a story with twists and turns but besides some left and right turns on the street the movie had nothing like this.

Kids of course come around from being always annoyed at their parents and lying to them to being very impressed and learning the true value of family.

For no good reason, the main bad guy is his dad, and that gets explained near the end by good old Basil Exposition.Maggie Q plays the Oddjob of the movie, and the whole movie is throwaway fluff that streaming channels produce that are specifically aimed at people who spend half of their time on their phone whilst watching the film, because you could go out for twenty minutes, come back, and not miss anything at all.The cast are fine, there's a pretty good set piece in a supermarket, and it all looks very nice.But I like Wahlberg, so what can you do?"", ""The movie turned out to be an absolute letdown from the very start. Right from the beginning, the acting felt unnaturally theatrical, especially in the interactions between the characters. Even with Mark Wahlberg onboard, the performances felt hollow and contrived, making it impossible to connect with the story. The dialogue sounded forced, devoid of any genuine emotion or natural flow, resembling more of a scripted reading than a genuine conversation, especially with the kids. The plot, involving an ex-hitman chased by villains while on a family road trip, rapidly descended into ridiculousness and absurdity. The attempted seriousness in life-threatening situations failed miserably, with laughably unrealistic scenarios that never worked after adding the comedic tone. The entire premise felt like a mockery, leaving me thoroughly disappointed and uninterested in continuing. It's a shame considering the potential of the initial concept, but the execution was nothing short of a train wreck.

Most of the mutants are long gone although Professor Charles Xavier is still alive";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
al attacks are mentioned in conversation; but never really discussed. Logan dismisses them with a couple of heavy one-liners; when they could have (and should have) led to an extended rumination on violence. The film doesn't miss a beat when Laura's friends brutally murder the guy with the mechanical hand. This lynch-mob logic should; again; have been a starting point for reflections that never happen in this shallow; trivial film.* Logan never has a character arc. Wolverine actually has far less emotional range in this film than in the first X-Men movie. His relationship with Laura is essentially the same as the far more developed relationship with Rogue.* Characters are neither built up; nor revealed. To do that; you have to show them in a range of different circumstances; dealing with emotionally or morally challenging dilemmas. In Logan; the only dilemma is how to keep eluding inexorable pursuit so as to stretch the film out past the two-hour mark. Hence the only character trait that can be revealed is dogged perseverance. We get that in the first scene. After that; nothing.* Ultimately; the filmmakers resort to having Logan shaved back to his familiar Wolverine muttonchops. You know you're in trouble when you're counting on facial hair to create characterization. (Or fan service.)* Plot is nonexistent. The film is one long chase. Weak screenwriters often mistake this for plot; but it's a poor substitute: totally linear; predictable; boring. Yes; there have been great 'chase' films (Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway comes to mind.) They take care to incorporate twists and turns; and strong moments of characterization. Logan doesn't. It's just a bunch of stuff that happens.On top of everything else; I had the creeping suspicion that this film was calculated less as a standalone work; than as a stepping-stone for the X-Men 'franchise.' It disposes of two performers who've stated their intent to depart the roles they created. And it seems to pave the way for the endlessly-discussed New Mutants franchise. Ugh. Replacing the people won't make up for a lack of ideas; and Logan shows very clearly how bereft of creative thinking the X-Men cinematic franchise has become.I didn't hate Logan as I was watching it. But when it ended I was overcome by a feeling of emptiness and disappointment. This film lacks both entertainment value and deep ideas. The Marvel cinematic universe badly needs a shot of new blood; but sadly;" this wasn't it."""""; 'LOGAN is brutal; merciless and powerful. This is a character-driven superhero movie done right. I would even dare to say it\'s better than many of the previous X-Men installments and spinoffs. And if this is indeed Hugh Jackman\'s final Wolverine movie; then my goodness; what a helluva way to go out in a blaze of glory.The story is set in the near future; mutants are thinning out. They\'ve either died or been hunted down. Logan\'s (Hugh Jackman) healing power is not as strong as it used to be. He\'s old and weary and taking care of professor X (Patrick Stewart) in a hideout on the Mexican border;" accompanied by Caliban (Stephen Merchant). But their attempt to hide from the world gets interrupted when dark forces arrive at their doorstep looking for a certain young little girl.Great move on the studio\'s and filmmakers\' part to have this film be rated R because what we get here is Wolverine unleashed. The violence is as graphic and fully exposed as you can imagine it to be. So just that aspect alone will excite the fanbase who\'s been wanting to see the destruction that could take place when Wolverine is really really angry. Setting it on the border does allow the film to play with certain tones and color palette reminiscent to """"Breaking Bad"""" for example"; the film\'s ending however does provide a more vibrant environment as a base for an extremely bloody collision.The writing is solid for a superhero film; it really digs deep into these beloved characters; how vulnerable they are; how they long for a world where people would just leave them be. You truly feel for Xavier and Logan in a way that you never did in the previous X-Men movies; not only because they\'re now in their twilight years but there\'s also that father-son type of relationship that\'s tough love and endearing and then there\'s also the reluctant father daughter connection Logan has with X-23. By the way; the little girl; Dafne Keen; who plays X-23 is remarkable. So much force; so much energy; so much roar; she\'s like a cheetah that just runs and slices and dices left and right without prejudice;" what an incredible young talent. This is a movie that gives you action to its fullest degree and an emotional journey that\'s uncompromising. The perfect film about the man who\'s the best at what he does but what he does isn\'t very nice.']""";;;;;;;

I'm not sure anyone could have done this other than Ryan Reynolds. I'd recommend a watch."", 'I entered the movie expecting to laugh out loud, and I did. Ryan Reynolds and Taika Waititi are comedic geniuses. What I didn\'t expect is the great chemistry between Ryan and Jodie Comer. Their relationship carried the movie.Also, the trailer and the first act made us believe that it\'s the generic ""we live in a simulation"" movie like many others. But, as we progress, the movie becomes its own thing. And it\'s fantastic.', ""Succeeded my expectations. I was anticipating a cheesy action 'comedy' with little to no comedy but Free Guy is a feel good movie that's actually funny & entertaining."", ""Ryan Reynolds is guy, a NPC living in the game Free City. He met Jodie Comer's character and discovers things about his world. There's also a real life part of the film, with Joe Keery, Jodie Comer again, and Taika Watiti.These are all great names. And with amazing direction, an original idea and great execution is what makes Free Guy such an endlessly entertaining film.This is a short review because i want to let you see it yourself and be amazed by how good Free Guy actually is.Did I enjoy it? Yes. Is it a flawless masterpiece? Maybe not. Did I smile throughout the whole film just because how fun it is? Hell yeah."", ""I found this film to be a mix of films such as Ready Player One, Groundhog Day and The Truman show but not as good as any of these films. The story is a bit bland and apart from the main character some of the others aren't written that well especially the films antangonist who just comes off as cringey.There's also constant references that are thrown at the audience which become too on the nose at times and the inclusion of well known streamers and you tubers got old quick. However, if you can switch your mind off for the run time there are some good jokes in the film and some fun scenes and it can be a somewhat enjoyable watch despite its flaws."", ""One of the biggest problems with movies these days are trailers. I say that because, well, it sort of kills some of the massive twists that could make the film much better. For instance, having a twists that Guy happens to be an NPC in a online shootem-up would have been pretty good. Then again, I'm not entirely sure if it would have worked out all that well anyway considering that the plot ended up being pretty predictable, and that we were accused of spoilers when in reality we have just pretty much figured out what was going on.As the trailer points out, Guy happens to be this NPC in an online shootem-up, and he meets this character that he falls in love with. It turns out that the character is actually a PC, and in fact there is more to this character than meets the eye. The thing is that the world is going to be shut down because the company that is running the game wants to upgrade it to a new release, however, as I suggested, something has happened in this version which means they have to fight against having the game shut down.It was suggested that this film was a cross between The Truman Show, and The Lego Movie, with a number of other things thrown in as well. Actually, this whole idea of living within a world oblivious to the fact that people are watching you is very much like the Truman Show, except that since Guy happens to be an NPC, nobody really pays all that much attention to him, that is until he decides to start leveling up.This is the catch, because apparently NPCs aren't supposed to do that, only players, however he manages to get his hands on a pair of glasses that reveals the reality of the world around him. However, as I suggested, he actually isn't supposed to do that, so how is it that an NPC is not only able to kill a PC, but also steal the PC's glasses. Well, that comes out eventually, but the thing is that it is pretty easy to actually work out once you know what is going on.Still, I did rather like this film, even though it wasn't anything that was necessarily original. One thing that it does is that it explores the nature of reality, and also the nature of consciousness (which has probably given a little bit too much away). Then again, this film doesn't dig too much into many of these issues, namely because it is a fairly light hearted film. On the other hand, especially with regards to the nature of reality, there is a lot of Trumanesque in this film.I thought it was fun, and enjoyable, but then again it is Ryan Reynolds, and I don't mind the odd Ryan Reynolds film, though he can be a little dry at times. Mind you, the innocence of Guy, and also the fact that he goes around doing good in a game that is a less raunchy version of GTA, is rather interesting. Of course, watching all of the violence going on behind the scenes while the NPCs simply wander around isn't too bad, which does sort of sets it apart from the other movies that I have mentioned, however, I can't really say that it is all that original.Hey, at least the Lego Movie left the big reveal until right at the end."", ""This film is fun, funny, and sweet, and I left the theater with a big smile on my face. It has a plot similar to some other films (Wreck-It Ralph and The Truman Show both come to mind), so it's not entirely original, but it's based on different media (a GTA-like MMORPG), so it's still unique.Reynolds is excellent as Guy, a loveable, naive NPC, and his performance is hilarious. His utter lack of understanding of Internet culture generated a lot of laughs in my theater.This is a great film for gamers, and it incorporates gaming culture without being overly stereotypical. There's the classic deadbeat gamer who lives with his mom, but there are also multiple girls shown playing the game and one of the film's stars is a female game designer.There's an amazing Marvel cameo near the end of the film. I won't spoil it, but it's a good one. Alex Trebek also makes his final appearance on screen.The only negative was Taika Waititi's Antoine. His character is supposed to be annoying, but his scenes are so over-the-top that they aren't fun to watch, and his one liners rarely earned as many laughs as any of the lines from the film's other characters. However, the rest of the film more than makes up for this.If you enjoy gaming and sci-fi and want a film that'll leave you feeling optimistic, this is the film for you."", ""Much like the virtual world in which the people of Free City live, the movie Free Guy is virtually a good movie. Most of the elements of a good movie are there, but it feels artificial, and you can tell that something is off. It's entertaining enough, and I appreciated the pop culture references and action sequences, but frankly I preferred this version of the story when it was called The Lego Movie."", 'This movie does not make any sense whether it\'s with how the game world functions (Ryan Reynold\'s life seemingly takes place in one game server, but regardless of whether it takes place in one server or multiple simultaneously the mechanics behind it don\'t make sense) or the decisions made in the outside world (such as wanting to create self-aware AI in a video game in the first place). There are various times where it seemed that the writer\'s have never played a video game before, and there is multiple ""fellow kids"" moments. The word ""troll"" is used multiple times, but the writers don\'t seem to actually know what that words means as indicated by how it is used. There are some enjoyable moments, and the movie is decently entertaining. However, there are also various moments that were pretty annoying. You definitely need to turn your brain off for this movie, and more so than in other comedies because of this non-sensical video game world that they created. Definitely not deserving of absurdly high score that it has received, but it\'s not terrible either.', ""While the majority of video game movies suck due to not being like the game they're based on, Free Guy has the advantage of being an original story based in a video game. Ryan Reynolds performance as Guy is great as per usual, the plot is original enough to be interesting, and the comedy (for me) hits right! Without getting into the spoilers, the pop culture references work better than expected. The only complaint I have is the streamer cameos were kind of dumb and they spent way too much time with them. Besides that Free Guy is a great popcorn movie and I highly recommend it!"", 'Think the Truman show if it was set in a video game. The self aware comedy and cameos were amazing. A great cast and wonderful writing/directing. Definitely worth the watch.', ""Guy (Ryan Reynolds) is a bank teller and Buddy (Lil Rel Howery) is his best friend.

She is in the game trying to find proof of that theft.It's a good idea but it's Ryan Reynolds who makes this good. He is the fun guy. He makes this fun. I do have a couple of problems with the movie. The security guy at the secret stash should be an NPC. At that point in the story, he should start convincing the other NPCs to help him outside of their programming. Also, there's no reason why the evidence is stashed in a room in the game. I get that it makes it easier but it makes no sense. All that is a little besides the point, it's Reynolds and he's the fun guy."", 'I reckon the future may hold a game like this for us ... where the AI is so developed, that NPC (non playable characters) live their own life in games, make their own decisions and so forth. Having Ryan Reynolds starring in this ... well it is a genius move to say the least. I called it the Ryan Reynolds show and I\'m quite certain no matter if you like this or not, in this regard you will agree with me.Having said that, there are other characters who give it their all, especially our female protagonist. Her counterpart in the real world is as overdrawn as he can be ... Taika does a really good job ... he is actually more comically and one sided that most of the characters in the game he developed ... well others did for him.And then you have the ally in the real world ... a good guy who has to be convinced and who has to come around ... and who you may never feel as much sympathy for as you did for Ryan Reynolds. Even when you figured the ""twist"" in his character and where the story leads ... apart from the revealing a scam thing.Having said all that, the movie boosts a lot of cameos ""in game"" and also real world ... has references galore (not just to GTA and apparently Fortnite, have not played the latter yet, but also to movies and persons/movie characters/franchises)! This can be so much fun if you spot them - not sure how some will play out in say a hundred years ... but you can never tell or guess the impact of something like that.The movie is insane and a lot of fun and has even a moral message in it of sorts.

Needed a bit more thought put into the overall concept but for what it was, it was okay."", 'Shawn Levy\'s Academy Award-nominated ""Free Guy"" is an homage to/parody of the whole culture surrounding multiplayer online games.

I was a little unsure at first, since the trailer made it look somewhat juvenile and slapstick. However, this movie completely exceeded any expectations I had. The storyline is so well done and very engaging - great characters who you really care about. They make you laugh and smile, with some romance thrown in along the way! All the performances were brilliantly done and the comedy was just so well timed and actually very funny - I was expecting some cringe.. but it was just brilliant.

Read all;"['The Dark Knight Rises was a perfect sequel to a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan took a different direction and focused more on Bruce Wayne/Batman. This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master.', 'Bane is a more terrifying nemesis than the Joker. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was booming. An unforgettable end to the trilogy', ""Christopher Nolan's epic trilogy concludes in glorious fashion and gives us a thought provoking and suitably satisfying conclusion to an epic saga. It's emotional, intense and has a great villain in Tom Hardy."", ""The Dark Knight Rises capped off what is probably the best comic book related trilogy of movies of all time. Earlier in the series you had Batman Begins and The Dark Knight with this just being the perfect way to finish off the series.Since the last movie it's been 7 years and Batman has been in seclusion since then. Christian Bale returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne. A new villain has emerged that being the menacing Bane played by the great Tom Hardy.The supporting cast has returning members like Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine in addition to new members like Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Marion Cotillard and Anne Hathaway.The movie has a running time of about 2 hours and 45 minutes but it doesn't seem like it at all, the movie flows like a 2 hour movie."", 'The Dark Knight Rises was an outstanding end to what has been the best trilogy I have ever seen.The film to me sums up what the batman stands for, the belief that someone can turn their leaf and become better, the belief that the fear that posses a person can be be destroyed or even help that person rise. what Christopher Nolan has given us in The Dark Knight Rises is not a lazy movie, it\'s a movie that makes the audience think because for me i had to watch the film many times until i have fully understand what has happened, and isn\'t that what makes a good movie when we have to watch it again and again and again.lets move on to the acting and the star man Christian Bale who again amazes me with his portrayal of Bruce Wayne, because even though we don\'t see a lot of the dark knight i personally am okay with that because i like seeing the real Bruce Wayne dealing with problems without the batman costume. another star man was Tom Hardy as Bane, ""scary"" yes, ""intimidating"" yes, ""witty"" yes and this list can go on. the thing that tipped it was that we can only see his eyes, to me he was only acting with his menacing eyes that just captivates any audience. Anne Hathaway as catwomen was a perfect cast as she brings the zing to the film, she\'s elegant and yet sexy at the same time, which was perfect casting. perfect casting all round including obviously Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Blake (robin).The Dark Knight Rises give audiences nearly three hours of pure excitement, for me i wanted it to continue for another three hours, the film was so good i had to watch the next day because it had every element of what makes a good batman film, such as the villain (bane) because he was the physical match for batman not like the other phenomenal batman films which was more psychotic villains. a good love story that doesn\'t bore the audience and a great ending. overall this was the ultimate ending to an ultimate trilogy which is a must watch. once again Christopher Nolan has done something special.', ""Wow. That's all I can say. I was freaked out about this movie, because I loved the first two. Too often have I gotten into a series, then been horribly disappointed by the last entry (e.g. the hunger games. I hated the third book). That being said, even though I was nervous, I still had high expectations. And it exceeded those. The acting was excellent, consistently to the previous movies. The action was good. The story was great. The characters were diverse and interesting, and despite the longevity of this film, it wasn't too slow at all. This movie was a emotional roller coaster. The ending ( here's where the spoilers start) was extremely sad, but ironically, that was really good. One thing i was nervous about was that the ending would be a typical superhero movie ending: happy because the main bad guy dies or gets arrested or whatever. This wasn't that.

And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better."", 'Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn\'t agree because of the ending, but I feel it\'s the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we\'d see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket ""rabbit"" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I\'m going to stop now or I could type forever.My only goal of writing this review is to help sway some others. Try to appreciate this movie for more than the gut wrenching ending.

If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero. But also most of the other cast members were great in their role and again, if you love Marvel, watch this movie."", 'This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists.

Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.', 'Infinity war seemed much better than endgame to be honest.', 'I don\'t mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War\'s 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it\'s 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it\'s awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn\'t let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn\'t particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. It\'s fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn\'t really original and its only redeeming factor is that it\'s full of characters we all know and love. It\'s funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it\'s really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there\'s no way any of the characters who ""died"" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it\'s cheap. From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that\'s about it. The editing isn\'t particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better. OVERALL: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" could have been amazing, but it\'s too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it\'s 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie.6.5 out of 10.', 'This film is way better than endgame!\nThe actions better\nThe writings better\nThe dialogues better\nThe cgi is better\nMore shocks and more emotional.\nWatching both in the cinema , the reactions to this in cinema was unbelievable compared to endgame.

This movie is a throwback to more of the mystery, thrillers we had in the 90s, but it's not Silence of the Lambs. The killer here is vicious and has a high body count. The pacing was pretty decent and I must say even more exciting than a lot of thrillers out today.First, that opening sequence will grab your attention and the movie is bright enough to see that action on screen. Every performance works here and is played as a straight forward, solid thriller. I read where folks were split in how it ended. In my opinion, I thought the whole movie is solid and the ending was perfect. This is that rare thriller that I'd actually pay to see again."", ""Good direction, good original story, good camerawork and a very good supportive score for the leads. Shailene Woodley is excellent in her role as a troubled law enforcement officer but boy, how fantastic Ben Mendelsohn is. I truly believe he is one of the best character actor of his generation, taking the lead here superbly without any fuss. They are both a joy to watch and their chemistry as investigator partners is profound. This movie may not shock you with its twists and turns like 'Seven', but it is definitely gives you a deep ride until the very end. Its character building is excellent. Just be patient and follow the flow."", ""The movie itself is great. It could have been a masterpiece because it has all the ingredients. Amazing cast, interesting non generic script and great scenarios. On the other hand, the ending felt a bit rushed. But let's start with the great.First, the cast does an amazing job here. Intense, real and deep characters.Second, the script is quite interesting (not original) but it has a few surprises that in my case I didn't see to come.Last, the settings are great. Love the cold vibes. Fargo's style.So, overall if you love good independent cinema this one is for you. Could have been a true masterpiece with a more elaborated ending. But nothing is perfect. Enjoy."", ""I haven't been rating movies, but I feel it is necessary for me to review this one. This is not a thrill-a-second kind of movie. It progresses intelligently and thoughtfully. It is a thinking movie. The acting and script are excellent. The two leads were perfect for this movie. They seemed to feed off of one another, trying to outdo each other as the best actor in the movie. So many movies fall flat at the end. But this one excelled. It actually has a good ending. I recommend this movie to anyone who is intelligent, and likes to think. Yes, it got a bit slow with some scenes that maybe could have been written a little better. That's why I'm only giving it an eight. But I don't know how anyone could walk away from this movie disappointed!"", ""It's a pretty good thriller, hesitate to call it great. The story wasn't groundbreaking but it was interesting and paced very well, so I wasn't bored at any point. Acting is great and dialogue is okay. I never watched this because I didn't have high expectations for it, I had recently watched Robots with Shailene Woodley around the time this came out so I thought they'd be of similar caliber. So this was a good surprise. It has glimpses of what could've been a great movie. Woodley was great, Ben Mendelsohn too, but I was most impressed by how naturally Ralph Ineson fit into his role. The ending was a bit of a twist. I don't think this is a masterpiece, but I was pleasantly surprised and impressed at how engaged I was due to my low expectations for it."", ""This starts with a great set up.

White supremicists targeted and taken down by a strong female character with addiction issues, the obligatory black police officer and a female black officer who dues exs into the the scene.After that it's the slippery slope of gay cop who is dying, killer who is not as well prepared or skilled as he has shown all movie, strong woman who takes him down and then inexplicably extorts the situation for her gain at the end.All in all, a terrible disappointment."", ""So it's like most crime dramas, you know, there's a killer, false lead, false lead, then true lead, true lead until they catch him.The first part was like that, like most crime movies. But I liked the second part, I'm not going to spoil anything, but the characters and their motivations felt real, felt like it could happen to anyone in this day and age. It left me thinking about a lot of stuff, it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth, a bit sad about what happened and overall the killer's story, which is more sad than violent.Overall I really enjoyed it, it's a slow burner but it pays off. I recommend it."", ""Greetings again from the darkness. Argentinian writer-director Damian Szifron was behind the terrific WILD TALES (2014), which received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, and this time out, he and co-writer Jonathan Wakeham venture into psychological crime procedural territory. A captivating opening sequence, expert photography, and top notch acting from the two leads keeps us watching, although there seems to have been some confusion on the best path for the script. The end result is watchable, but not memorable.It is New Year's Eve in Baltimore and celebrations, revelry, and parties are occurring all over the city. As beat cop Eleanor Falco (Shailene Woodley, THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, 2014) negotiates a mundane rift between an irritated diner owner and a slow-eating customer, shots begin to ring out. This frantic sequence captures the panic as we witness a few of the 29 gun shots that find a target. Officer Falco races a couple of blocks to the high-rise building where an explosion occurs. It turns out the sniper destroyed his own lair in order to avoid leaving evidence.Enter renowned FBI Agent Lammark (Ben Mendelsohn, ANIMAL KINGDOM, 2010) who takes charge of the investigation. This point is mentioned because the chain-of-command plays a vital role in the proceedings ... Lammark wants to run the investigation, but bureaucrats and politicians interfere. Lammark hones in on Falco and her instincts. Of course, she has a checkered past that includes having her FBI application denied. Here she acts as a liaison and provides insight into the killer. Get it? One damaged person can relate to another.Some social commentary gets periodically interjected - gun control, power plays by law enforcement, misplaced priorities by politicians - but the fun part is watching Mendelsohn and Woodley flash their respective talent. She's kind of a flawed Clarice Starling and he's a guy that is committed to finding the bad guy. Filmed in Montreal, cinematographer Javier Julia maintains a cool atmosphere throughout, and Carter Burwell's music delivers some excellent piano parts. This ends up being one of those movies that's enough fun to watch if you don't think too hard while it's playing, and it also reminds us that Ben Mendelsohn and Shailene Woodley are fine actors who deliver in every role.Opens in theaters on April 21, 2023."", ""Extremely dissapointed in this mess . Both leads ,Sharlene & Ben ,phoned in their performances. Right from the start where the lead character inserts herself in crime scenes and is chosen to join the FBI team ( yeah, like that happens) , I knew we were in for a shitshow. I was really hoping that the killer would take her character out towards the end of the show .mendelsohn mubbles thru his performance and just looks so disinterested in being there , ( and I'm a fan of his work ) .A weak plot and very loose direction on show for all to see.I really wish I could get a refund from iTunes for suffering thru this mess."", ""You want a good popcorn night see a straight-forward cop movie with good actors and great cinematography. This is the film for you. I don't see Silence of the lambs when I see this film, but more a throwback to other 90's like Hillstreet Blues. Just a solid film with no VFX and superman capes. The script is a little thin but I was glued to my seat and there is quite a lot of suspence and excitement so kudos to the director and the pacing and music. I could have appreciated a different ending but looking back on it now... To Catch a Killer had to end this way. This is sign that movies of this kind, are back in the theaters! And i think this is a film to encourage if solely for that reason. Enjoy your porcorn."", ""I'm a huge fan of thrillers. Silence of the Lambs, and Se7ven are among my favorite movies of all time so I had high hopes after having watched the trailer.So why the low rating. Cinematography is great (lighting, color grading, audio, etc.), Shailene Woodley as the lead does a good job but overall the story is just too thin and the majority of the cast is not delivering.Would have loved to see a deeper story where you really felt attached to the detectives - just like Mills/Sommerset or Starling in the aforementioned movies. And also the killer here is underwhelming - not played well and his raison d'etre is just not good enough.So hoping for this genre to grow but unfortunately this movie does not deliver and will not be one to remember."", ""The story starts with a firework on New Year's Eve. This is the story of a girl who starts helping a detective catch a killer. The story is well-written. You can't predict what happens next. The acting crew is well-selected.

Also, you see a lot of nice heli-shots over the city. There are many action scenes in the movie. I liked the background music and sound effects. The ending was nice. I recommend this movie to action and crime fans."", 'With its two fine stars and gripping opening scenes ""To Catch A Killer"" shoulda / coulda been a top-class cop / psycho thriller, but co-writer (with Jonathan Wakeham) / director Damián Szifron plods, stumbles & loses his way - to deliver something way more ordinary. When an ace sniper kills 20+ folk one Baltimore NYE, under fire senior FBI agent Ben Mendelsohn and keen, astute (but troubled) beat cop Shailene Woodley team up to figure him out & hunt him down - though bureaucratic nincompoops, elusive witnesses and false leads slow them up. Support from the likes of Ralph Ineson & Jovan Adepo couldn\'t save this one from its own hum-drum mediocrity.', ""To Catch A Killer was much better then I expected. I was thinking this was going to be a straight to dvd type of film and it was far from it. Our two main leads are investigating a string of mass shootings to identify the suspect and bring him to justice. Right from the get go in this film it reels you right in and does not let up. The big downside to this film is that the acting is very stiff in most areas when it should not be. I really thought the casting was solid here but the script could have been tighter with less dialogue perhaps. The action is very realistic in this movie and can be disturbing to watch for some. Overall I had a good time with this film but probably wouldn't be rewatching it anytime soon. To Catch a Killer gets 6 stars out of 10 from me."", 'I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It depicted events vividly, and it had good attention to details, like radio listeners calling in to say dumb stuff to get fame in the wake of an event, corrupt morals, and how you can struggle with mental illness and be on the total opposite polar if each other because of it. I loved the ending also for this very reason.The actors in this move did a good job also, and the music made it a very exciting watch. It threw me a bit back to the 90s detective moves at times, and that was a refreshing change.. The movie also had a very strong sense of foreboding atmosphere throughout.', 'The entire film comes across like a fan of James Patterson and Law & Order: SVU watched a John Douglas interview and thought, ""I can write a screenplay about profiling!"" But not just any cat and mouse, ""on the trail of a serial killer"" story! No, this one will have dialogue with the confidence and uncomfortable mellow-drama of a slam poetry reading.I can suspend disbelief with films. If it\'s engaging and feels earnest, I can enjoy it, even if it strays outside of ""realistic."" This movie and its primary characters, are absurd. Apparently the FBI is filled with hapless, knee jerk egomaniacs that don\'t think before they act or bother to thoroughly investigate a suspect. Oh, of course, except the philosophical lone wolf agent who could easily crack the case on his own, but for goodwill and a lark, enlists the help of a suicidal, mentally ill beat cop who was denied entry to the bureau years ago despite her uncanny, stellar insights into the mind of killers. She has an eye for them because she, too, is tortured!!! Big ol\' booooo!!! I wonder how many FBI agents wax philosophic while sipping coffee and then subvert the cliched movie trope of telling the local authorities to ""stand down"", by doing open mic night/motivational speaking in a quiet room of eighty cops. I can see the writer fist pumping and cracking his knuckles after that one.Everything about it smells like contemporary studio films with a checklist of disingenuous, forced archetypes (both ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"") and producer notes. Like, can we get some high fives for *insert gender, race, sexual orientation, possible mental afflictions, political affiliation, etc*?Also, I get tax incentives, and movies are very expensive, but Baltimore by way of Canada, including Montreal accents? I gotta have at least one character that sounds like they\'re in a John Waters movie.And the runtime. Come on. Wrap this up in 1:40:00 and then shave off another ten.', ""I'm impressed honestly. This was a rare 2 hour film that gets you hooked from the first scene until the last. The acting is very good, especially Shailene Woodley. Her character is very complex and she absolutely nailed it. Ben is also good as he always is.The plot is very engaging, juxtaposing police, FBI, mass killings and they thread in themes of addiction and trauma as the story moves along.Also enjoyable is all the cinematography and direction. They leverage a lot of long shots, aerials, outdoor locations and interiors with a nice balance that also helps the viewer absorb the story and acting.This is one of my favorite films in the last few years and I can't wait to rewatch it! 8/10."", ""Hollyweird has been in a major slump for A LONG TIME now and EVERYTHING stinks. I actually enjoyed this. Granted, it's a well used plot that has a relatively predictable ending. However, it threw a new motive out in the world. The 'bad guy' doesn't have typical beef with society (if you watch the movie no then read this you'll say ha ha - bad pun), he's not looking for money. I think many have been turned off by this movie due to the pace and the formulaic plot but it has some serious imagery and makes you believe that THIS SCENARIO could actually happen (unlike many other films that are so over the top). In a post covid, post George Floyd world, it even manages to throw a nod here and there how the last 3+ years has affected us as a society.It's not the greatest film in the world but IMO - it's worth a watch.

Not because the movie wasn\'t what I thought it would be, but on the contrary, it was so much more than I had ever expected.Going into the theater, I was expecting a corny kids movie with decent acting and a fantastic, unrealistic plot. Needless to say the plot was indeed fantastic and unrealistic, but it was all kept in check with solid acting and the most incredible display of visual effects that I have EVER seen. Most...actually almost all of the acting credit in this movie has to go to Shia LaBeouf, whom is quickly becoming a Hollywood star after recently giving an excellent performance in the thriller ""Disturbia"". It was another great performance from Shia in ""Transformers"", with his clever wit still ever present.However, the most impressive aspect of ""Transformers"" was most certainly the special effects. The robot vs. robot fight scenes were, in a word, remarkable. I didn\'t know that modern day special effects could produce images so fantastic AND realistic, to the point where the robots didn\'t seem computer generated at all. The interaction between human and robot was beautiful and flawless. It seemed like the actors were actually interacting with real, 50 foot tall robots during the movie. ""Transformers"" will, without a doubt, be the pioneer for future cinematic visual effects.The plot may have been a little unrealistic and some of the acting a little sketchy at times, but it does not in any way override what was truly an entertaining movie. The plot simply stayed true as best it could to the cartoon story without becoming overly ridiculous or corny. When I say unrealistic, that does not mean ""cartoon-corny"". In fact, I would recommend that ANYONE over the age of 13 go to see this movie. I promise you won\'t be disappointed.', ""It's August 9th 2020. I am watching this again for the 100th time. Never thought about reviewing it until now. As a massive fan in the 80s I was obsessed with the Comics (have them all) the toys and the tv cartoon. When I learned this was being made I had zero expectations except the trailers making it look something special. It really did not disappoint. The CGIof the robots is brilliant. The story is something that falls in line with the source material which okay isn't the most amazing of stories however it's a modern twist with elements of subtle comedy a real babe in Megan and a badass Megatron. I know people were upset with the decision to scrap Megatron turning into a gun but how would it have worked? This is by far the best of all the movies made so far. If you are a real fan you'll appreciate the efforts made I know I am."", 'Worth seeing again.\nTop-class science fiction.\nLots of action and wild scenes .. Great movie in the beginning of the zeros.', 'When the announcement came for a new Transformers movie for Summer, I was pretty excited. I wasn\'t a major Transformers fan, but I had fond memories of the cartoon and toys. However, I hated the re-designed Transformers, thinking that these new designs were an overly busy cross between Lego\'s Bionicle toys and expressionist modern art sculptures. I also heard the script was poor, so I decided to skip this one.However, I started hearing movie reviews about what an amazing film this was. ""The greatest film of all time!"" people proclaimed. So I came to terms with and accepted that these weren\'t the robots I grew up with, this was a ""new"" version, and I\'d at least find interest in robots transforming into cars and beating each other up. I\'d even go see this even though I don\'t like Michael Bay films.How was it? Transformers is a disgustingly bloated and self-indulgent piece of crap. I understand that I\'ll get rated down for my review, but I\'m prepared to accept that. Sadly, my theater must not have gotten the euphoria inducing gas that apparently other theaters got, causing me to gush over this film like other people.Even the 1986 Transformers film wasn\'t perfect. It was basically one fight scene after another, and was a means to replace the old toys for a new line, but the action was good, showed the consequences of war, and featured the death of a beloved character. It kept true to the mythos, even though it was different. This movie makes reference to so many other films that it feels like a mishmash of 30 films you\'ve seen before.Bumblebee sends up an ""Autobat Symbol"" to summon the other Autobots like Batman. There\'s a scene in an underground bunker which felt totally pulled from Terminator 3 (and a few scenes later, uses the exact drumbeat from the ""Terminator Theme""). The fight scenes with their out of focus cameras and ""shaky cam"" style seems like they are trying to treat the battles as if they were ""Saving Private Ryan"" caliber. When Bumblebee gets captured during a scene, the music swells up so mournfully and overdramatically, that it makes the tragedies found in ""Schindler\'s List"" seem modest.The biggest problem in character design lies in the fact that they all really do look alike. The worst offender was the Decepticon Frenzy, which looked like a 3D rendered pencil scribble, and acted like the Zuni Fetish Doll from ""Trilogy of Terror"". During the final battle, I was having problems telling who was who, and when the robots collided, it was hard to see where one began and the other ended. The car forms were presented as blatant product showcases, ripped straight from a commercial. Then again, there was so much product placement in the film. eBay must have made a fortune.The slow set-up to the action or even any real glimpses of the title characters felt like ""The Hulk"". I pay for a movie about transforming robots, that\'s what I want to see.Why would they keep a deadly robot under Hoover Dam, a major water source and tourist attraction? Why would they bring this ""All-Spark"" out of the desert and into a heavily-populated city where property damage and civilian casualties could run their full course. The dialogue was painful, sounded like it was written for teenagers, by teenagers in a really bad fanfic like what they thought people would say. What really irked me is how the Autobots couldn\'t seem to kill a Decepticon, but a lone soldier skidding on his back could dispatch one with a single shot. Why were the Autobots even there if the humans could do it better? How is it that they can save Bumblebee, but they can\'t repair Jazz? What was the difference? The government/military/robot/anyone dialogue was totally unrealistic, with officials willing to ""bet their ridiculously high government paychecks"" on hunches. Every line smacked on bad puns, clichés, or just sounded stupid. There was an extended conversation about masturbation between Sam and his parents that felt really awkward and extended far too long.The personalities were also way underdeveloped. Transformers has over two decades of history that wasn\'t touched upon. The Starscream and Megatron rivalry, where Starscream tried to usurp Megatron for leadership was not mentioned or covered at all. Jazz was cool and fun-loving with a sense of style, while in the film he sounds like a ghetto thug. His first line is profanity, and I felt insulted. Not because of the language, but the fact that this was apparently the best the writers could do. Decepticons were introduced and blown away within minutes. The Autobots weren\'t much better. Did the people who wrote the story know anything about the subject material besides the fact that robots changed to vehicles? And then Optimus Prime. Obviously, Bay\'s madness knew better than to totally ruin this character, as he was the only robot who looked even remotely familiar to any previous version. And the personality was fairly accurate... up to the backyard scene, where Prime\'s personality suddenly shifts, breaks character, and he becomes a clumsy comedian. The next scene, he shifts back into a ""leader"" personality.The saving grace outside of Prime was Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf), who brought a credible ""gee whiz"" performance to the film, and yet I felt sorry for him using such ham-fisted dialogue.Summer 2007 has been really mediocre for ""blockbuster"" films, as we\'re apparently supposed to lower our standards, ""sit back, not think and enjoy"" with these types of films, but how is one supposed to do that with with film devoid of heart, personality or no focus on the main characters? As a stand-alone film, this is a really bad movie. As a Transformers-licensed film, it\'s a God awful embarrassment. I\'m avoiding the sequels unless they drastically overhaul the franchise and get a script not limited to high-school level online fanfic.', 'Most awesome film I had watched that year and still is good to watch again best film of my childhood and is full of some good action scenes throughout', 'This deafeningly loud, obnoxious, usually stagnant and glorified epic disaster of a film was presented with too many opportunities to be one of the all-time greatest summer flicks ever. However, despite the advancements in today\'s special effects, it being inspired from the highly popular 1980\'s Hasbro toys and cartoon, with Steven Spielberg overseeing the production as an Executive producer, Michael Bay and his writers were still guilty of making this a ""steaming pile."" I can effortlessly breakdown at every level why this film didn\'t work for me.The story was about a teenager name Sam (Shia LaBeouf) who purchases a car that happens to be a robot in disguise from another world. Sam is then caught in the middle of an ancient battle between two groups of these alien robots, the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons. Both are seeking a mysterious cube known as the ""Allspark"" that contains their ""life source."" This central plot intertwines with the story of a special ops team being attacked by one of the Decepticons in the beginning, the pentagon enlisting teams of computer hackers to decode a signal they detected that ultimately came from the Decepticons and a hokey love story between Sam and Mikaela, the gorgeous bombshell in his class.As intriguing as all of this may sound, besides the many battle scenes, car chases, attempts on Sam\'s life and Decepticon attacks, nothing happens to move the story along. Whatever layers of stories that were suppose to be happening beneath the unimpressive action sequences were uneventful and slow. So, all you\'re left with is the action, which by the end was boring and tedious to watch.The characters were flat and moronic. The humans were one-note, soulless caricatures. They were also more than capable of damaging the robots, which took away from the extraordinary antagonism the original cartoon presented for our human heroes. The humans were helpless against the Decepticons and this made the Autobots necessary. In this absurd film, the humans didn\'t really need the Autobots to take out the Decepticons.And whatever happened to characters like Jorge ""Fig"" Figueroa and Maggie? They sort or left this film halfway to the end to join the film playing in the theater next door.Also, part of the cartoon\'s success was the personalities of the Transformers. They were emotional beings that were capable of treacherous, loyal, courageous, cowardice, morose and optimistic behavior. They weren\'t just giant piles of junk destroying an American metropolis. Whatever happened to the ongoing struggle for power over the Decepticons between Starscream and Megatron? This would\'ve added some real complexity to this paper-thin story. Instead, Bay and the writers settled for hinting at it with a laughable one-liner from Megatron that rang falser than the action. Wasn\'t Bumblebee the kindest, frailest of them all? He was essential for his undying compassion for the humans in the cartoons. Not in this film, where he obviously fought in many battles and, when annoyed, can urinate on a human being at any given time. Now going from the true character to the characterizations of the robots, the looks of the original were more engaging and attractive to the eye. In this film, they looked like metal scraps of junk.Then the films auteur had to take it there by making Jazz the Transformer with the Black-American soul, screaming, ""What up, b****es?"" Ironically, he was the only Autobot that easily gets killed as well. Now, a lesser minded person would pull the race card for this. I would just blame it on lazy, unimaginative, sloppy, hack writing and directing. In the end, I couldn\'t care less about any of the characters, human or Transformer.The original Transformers could be chastised for wooden dialogue. However, when the characters weren\'t trying to be funny in this film, the dialogue was ten times worse than that of the cheesy words spoken in the cartoon. It was absolutely ridiculous, with zero subtext. The quality of the dialogue was lessoned in scenes where exposition was inappropriately forced in, like the ineptly written scene when Agent Simmons (John Turturro) was questioning Sam and Mikael in the backseat of the SUV, revealing Mikaelas\' weak back story. And how many times did Optimus Prime have to tell us his name? At one point, I thought he was forgetting the many times he said his name previously. Besides, the whole introducing-yourself-thing from the Transformers, especially the Decepticons, was extra cheddar cheesy to me: ""I am Megatron!"" Yeah, and?! The monologues underscored by the sappy music could\'ve gotten the collective ""heave-hove"" from this film as well.The special effects were cool but could\'ve been better. Most of the time, the Transformers looked animated instead of real in my opinion. And the confusing, unorthodox way they transformed, not to mention detailing that made them look like piles of scrap metal, revealed most of the flaws in the cartoon like computer generated images. As a director, I wouldn\'t be satisfied with the end result.The most entertaining thing about sitting through a screening of this film was the hordes of people that were going ballistic over it. They laughed at anything and applauded for everything. From Bumblebee shattering all the glass in and around the car dealership to the Autobots skidding in unison on a U-Turn, these people thought every little thing deserved a standing ovation. Okay, maybe they were not standing. But it was all so laughable to me.In my opinion, Bay, Spielberg and the writers massacred what could\'ve been one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. The only thing amazing about this experience was my girl sleeping through most of it with me nodding off right along side her. Bay has proved himself to be one of the worst, overpaid film directors in the history of Hollywood.', ""Transformers is a really good movie it's got really good action scenes it's got the best plot and good character development and the action scenes are well spaced out and an exceptional third act but the best part of the movie is megatron"", ""Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay team up for the exciting and action packed blockbuster Transformers. Earth becomes caught up in a war between two groups of alien robots that have come in search of a device that gave life to their planet. That cast includes Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, John Turturro, and Jon Voight, who all bring a certain charisma to the film. But the real stars of the film are the special effects, which are amazing. And Michael Bay does an excellent job at delivering high energy action sequences that are visually stunning. The writing is exceptionally poor and the film goes on for far too long, but the action and the visual effects keep the audience engaged.

What if this movie is just another Independence Day and War of the World. It is unmistakable that aliens taking over the world is an idea that has been worn out but what makes this movie shine is the personality. What its predecessors failed to do was give the alien/robot personality which is very different in Transformers.

We as viewers get to LISTEN CONSTANTLY to the thoughts of this meticulous and ruthless professional killer, who is on a revenge killing spree after his wife got molested by his very crime boss whom he worked for.The monologue is THE movie. Not kiddin'. There is little to NO diaologue or interaction between any other characters. It's solely focussed on Michael Fassbender's thoughts as a character and those thoughts unfortunately werent the most interesting. Not terrible, but not elevating me either....Something else DID disappoint me more though...More bad: I was waiting for SOME surprising and original twist or plot turn, that would make this story stand out from any other crime movie, which unfortunately never came. Bummer. There isnt a satisfying final to this story. On the contrary the final is a bit underwhelming. There definitely is a lack of true drama and thrill towards the end.The good: It has got several beautiful features though, like this bleak and dark lit photography, a sparse yet very effective hypnotizing soundscore and several great actors performing well (yet not extraordinary well). And the suspense and violence is almost hypnotic like, really mesmirizing.Despite this definitely being another quality made crime movie, it is not one of director David Fincher's best. Still worth a watch though, but I only would dare recommmend this to the arthouse movie fans of this killer crime genre."", ""It's well compiled. The narration got me invested. Shot beautifully, the suspenseful music is excellent. The movie as a whole is...yeah it's fine? It lacks depth and some scenes lack logic as well. It makes for a fun watch nevertheless. Better than most of the stuff going around these days. A one time watch and you never think about it again kind of a watch. Not Fincher's best but not his worst either. Fassbender is decent in his role portrayed as a mysterious killer who has a knack for everything pretty much. Solid punches to the face by a guy twice his size does not faze him at all. That's about it really."", 'David Fincher is good. The directing is decent, camera work clear yet not as great as usual. The sound design is great. The story ... is nonsense. This is what reviewers notice here. Is it too slow? Not enough story? Mediocre theme? Sure all of this is true yet that\'s not the problem it\'s just the issues as viewers see it. The problem is that the story is just not properly constructed so no matter what else is wrong you never quite get into the story and movie overall. Fincher has made too slow movies before that ended up working anyhow. He has made movies with lacking stories and very little theme. But he has never made movies where everything we see is nonsense.We see a masterful hitman who for the first 25 min of the movie is just alone in a room talking about how cold and focused he is. But the first thing we see him do is screw up. He is supposed to snipe his target yet a woman constantly walks in front of the target and we see that there is no shot. Yet he takes the shot and she somehow walks in front of the bullet in that split second. Not sure why or how this happened, but I as a loser nobody with zero understanding of what a hitman does could see this coming from 100 miles away yet this guy who spent 25 min bragging about his skills can\'t make this 20 meter shot? Really?Next up we see him get home and his house was broken into. His girlfriend has been injured. So what happened? Why would an expert hitman give his address to anyone whatsoever? We then see him find and hold his lawyer at gunpoint in his search for revenge. His lawyer tells him that the client made him give him the killer\'s address and the lawyer just thought the killer would never return home so nothing would happen. Why did his lawyer, the guy giving him the hitjobs, have his address? This makes zero sense. What would happen if the lawyer got arrested for anything and then promised to give the prosecutors bigger fishes for no jail time? This happens all the time. Well, he has the address of a mass killer and the killer would be arrested hours later. Anything can go wrong.We then see him rob a taxi office to steal info on the taxi driver who drove the 2 killers coming after him. Instead of just paying for the info he decides to force it out and then shoots the innocent cab driver. Keep in mind if you pay someone money to tell you stuff it won\'t ever make the frontpage of any paper no matter how small. And basically no cops would be on the case. If you kill a cab driver after having robbed his office you will have heat on you. And the cops will know the cab driver drove the 2 people who beat up his girlfriend. They will know who the killer is as they will know it\'s a revenge act by the guy living in the house and the guy in the taxi office saw his face too. Half the police force would be after him in days. This is just nonsense. Plus we now also feel this guy is pure evil and stupid and can\'t root for him.We then see the killer break into a house and fight another hitman. Then throw a molotov into the house to burn it down. Why not just throw the molotov first then as the guy runs out shoot him? Why walk into the house of a hitman knowing how dangerous it is? And of course he nearly dies in the hand to hand combat fight as predicted. We literally saw him use a sniper prior to that. We know he can kill a dangerous hitman without being spotted yet his plan here is this? Is his IQ 80 or something?We then see him dine with his next target with plenty of waiters seeing his face. And after that the tracks down the CEO who put a hit on him after he failed the hit job the CEO ordered. And first time ever he doesn\'t kill his target. He just walks away. Again having shown his face. He just trusts that this killer CEO never meant to kill the killer. Yet the innocent cab driver is a valid target? There are no rules and no consistency here. It\'s just a random story. Did he forgive the CEO? Did he trust his excuse? Did he just not want to kill anymore? It could be anything, but no story is told. And why is he still living in that house? Why is he not fleeing?So we see a fool who fails 100% of the hitman jobs we have ever seen him do track down further victims always showing his face and always killing them up close instead of from the distance. We see him fail simple plans again and again. And finally we see him not kill a target even after having killed random people who he should have left alone. I assume the comic explains this stuff, but the movie surely does not. It\'s still fun to watch a single time just to watch Fincher. But I wish there was a story here. And I wish reviewers would notice this stuff and not just lazily point out that ""the story was simple"". Be smart about the content you consume.', ""I don't understand why people give this movie 1-2 stars.

It's a bit like nobody knew what to do with the ever-growing number of family members because of course Dom can sort it all out himself (because HERO) and so they're all just scattered around the globe doing absolutely sweet-nothing while Dom and Dante pulverize every continent they step on (Bombs go Boom Boom ).Jason Momoa is the best thing about this film by not an inch but a quarter of a mile. His flamboyant take on Dante's character is sure to steal every scene he's in while Vin Diesel is over there trying to act like he's in Hamlet or smth.John Cena was actually pretty decent too. A breath of fresh air in this over the top franchise that takes itself a bit too seriously while defying all the laws of physics. Annoyingly he doesn't make it or does he?

Darkness of Man may not be a straight up action vehicle that Van Damme has released before but this film does offer entertainment and I enjoyed Van Damme a lot in this film, but the real Suprise for me was Spencer Breslin (Santa Clause, The Kid, Cat in the hat, Zoom) as his character was definitely not what I was expecting, their are also a slew of cameos, like 90210's Shannon Doughtery who had a small part in the film, legendary actor Eric Roberts actually had a blink of an eye cameo in the film and then martial arts dragon Queen Cynthia Rothrock as a Nurse in the film.

His acting prowess is underrated but in this film, he shows off a whole range of emotions...The film has many twists and turns and the final suspense is mind-blowing.

JCVD has been around for forty years and his acting has barely improved. This has a lot of narration from him and his accent is still the same. The filmmaking is mostly uninspired and the story is blandly derivative. There is one action scene where they try to make it interesting.

Guy Ritchie's the Covenant;2023;Action, Drama, Thriller;7.5;R;63;Guy Ritchie;Jake Gyllenhaal, Dar Salim, Sean Sagar, Jason Wong, Rhys Yates, Christian Ochoa Lavernia, Bobby Schofield, Emily Beecham, Jonny Lee Miller, Alexander Ludwig, Reza Diako, James Nelson-Joyce, Gary Anthony Stennette, Saboor Sahak, Antony Starr, Abbas Fasaei, Hadi Khanjanpour, Ash Goldeh;During the war in Afghanistan, a local interpreter risks his own life to carry an injured sergeant across miles of grueling terrain.;"['Though I am most certainly a ""dove"" when it comes to my opinions on war and the military industrial complex, I also recognize that it is important to hear the stories of the individuals who do choose to serve in the armed forces, as their bravery is beyond question. An actor like Jake Gyllenhaal certainly draws me to projects like this, and here teamed up with director Guy Ritchie ""The Covenant"" is a film that subverts expectations at every turn but ultimately ends up being better for it every time.For a very basic overview (one that will include some spoilers simply by nature of the film\'s changing arcs), this movie tells the story of Master Sergeant John Kinley (Gyllenhaal) in the later years of the Afghanistan war (roughly 2018). Kinley\'s company is assigned an interpreter--Ahmed (Dar Salim)--who is an expert at his craft but often takes matters into his own hands (very strong-willed, in other words). After a series of relatively normal (if inane) patrols for Taliban weapons, one such outing goes south quickly and both Kinley & Ahmed are left stranded. With a wounded Kinley on death\'s doorstep, Ahmed\'s heroic survival efforts lead to their safety. Kinley survives and is sent back home--but then discovers that the visa promised to Ahmed & family has not been executed. In extreme emotional torment at this treatment of his literal savior, Kinley tries to navigate the military bureaucracy but realizes that he may have to return to Afghanistan to get the job done himself.One of the clear hallmarks of ""The Covenant"" is how it never quite turns out to be the movie you expect. At first, it presents as a pretty standard ""root out the bad guys"" flick. Then, it transitions into an escape/survival mission. When that comes to a close, there are a solid 45-or-so minutes of runtime left, those being devoted to Kinley trying to honor the bond he (and the U. S. military, by extension) made with Ahmed that isn\'t being honored. In less capable hands this shifting could be disastrous, but Ritchie executes it nearly flawlessly.It helps, of course, to have the extremely talent (yet seemingly still always a bit underrated) Gyllenhaal in the leading role. Not only can he more than pull off the action/stunt sequences convincingly, but his tremendous everyman, character-actor persona carries the back portion of the film. Viewers are utterly dependent on identifying with Kinley\'s emotional torment at the thought of Ahmed not being properly treated, and Jake has no problem making that happen.Finally, the over-arcing message of the film is subtle enough to not be over-bearing in any way but also present just enough to not seem vapid. Though portraying the horrors (both physical and psychological) of combat, it also muses upon the experience of establishing a military presence in a country, making commitments to those societies, and then ultimately leaving and seeing much progress lost. In this way, ""The Covenant"" is a deep-thinking film without any pompous or deep-thinking speeches to pull it off.To be honest, I had nothing other than Jake G. And positive word-of-mouth drawing me to ""The Covenant"". But I\'m glad I saw it, as it was a fascinating glimpse in the Afghanistan war both in micro and macro capacities.', ""I was in OIF 2007, and we had a awesome interpreter in our platoon. I can't say his name but he was a family man and he wanted to help his country by helping us.This movie reminded me of him and what he sacrifice for us. He's still alive and well.This movie had me on the edge of my seat the actors, camera work, plot and suspense was a perfect mix though out the entire movie.The only thing I kinda cringed about was the two vehicle Convoy(down range it's usually 4 minimum) and the unlimited AK ROUNDS in the first 1/2 hr. But besides that great movie. I remember the smells of from the middle east and the dry air ."", ""That's all I really got to say about this movie... the first act in itself was amazing, but added together with the second and third, this movie was absolutely gripping. I rarely find myself verbally willing the characters on in movies, but this one had me muttering 'cmon, CMON!!!' every single time the action ramped up. I love Jake in just about everything he does, and although this was no exception, it was the interpreters performance that took me by surprise. Balancing calmness and urgency, Dar Salim absolutely took me by surprise. I cannot recommend this one more than I already have so I leave you with one last phrase... SEE THE MOVIE!"", 'You cannot go wrong with Jake Gyllenhaal. He should have won an Oscar by now as he is every bit as intense and talented as Leonardo DiCaprio. ""The Covenant"" starts out as what seems to be a garden-variety war movie, but with interesting off kilter shots and soundtrack, compliments of Guy Ritchie. Then it takes you to its main act, which capably veers away from action scenes to emphasize something human, honorable, and heartfelt. A surprising twist from a brutal, violent movie is that instead of the usual revenge theme, this is about ""paying your debts"" and doing something that redeems one\'s integrity. The journey to get there is quite intense, and Gyllenhaal finds himself an equally dramatic match with Dar Salim portraying Ahmed. His deep eyes say so much even when he is not saying anything.', 'If you\'ve seen the preview for The Covenant, you already know everything that\'s going to happen.Even if you *didn\'t* see the preview, you could predict the path of this story without much brain power";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The action was bland, short and just seemed like everything we\'ve already seen before. The truly only great part of this movie was the scene with quicksilver and that was a really short piece of the movie. Once that scene was over the rest of the movie became this huge bore. I go to a movie like this with the usual expectation of seeing something ""new"".. well I was let down.The majority of the movie was completely boring. There were only a few scenes of very mediocre action and it just seemed like they did not put a lot of effort into this movie.', ""In the future, the world is devastated by constant war.

They have to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) who tries to kill weapons designer Trask (Peter Dinklage).This is a compelling sci-fi thriller achieving one of the most seamless transition from an old cast to the new. The story is terrific. It introduces Quicksilver as a fresh injection of fun. That's probably the only minor complaint. It needs a bit more fun to offset the serious tones. It's not really a complaint. OK! Forget about it. The new cast is set to take off in place of the old."", ""*Spoilers*I tried not to get myself hyped up too much with this film because when Matthew Vaughn left I was pretty bummed out. I loved First Class and the new feel that X-Men had, I was really looking forward to him carrying that on. Unfortunately, Bryan Singer took over. Even with this lowered expectation, I found myself sitting in the cinema multiple times thinking 'Ok we get it, we understand what is at risk here, please lets get on with it!'. To start with the good points.The opening - visually amazing and the film was off to a great start. Blink was my favourite of this sequence, her powers of portals were used in really creative ways and kept the action flowing well.I didn't think I would like Quicksilver at all but I found all the scenes he was in to be extremely entertaining and gave the film the comic book feeling again. You know, that feeling of just enough realism to make it believable yet enough humour to add the fun comic book side of things? He was that in spades and I found my self disappointed when he didn't join up with the X-Men for the rest of the film.The actors. It was great to such an ensemble on screen and I'd even go as far as saying the young Charles (James McAvoy) stole the show, with the young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) a close second.There were some nice little nods to most of the other X-Men films and it was good to see all the tie-ins. Also the very few humorous parts, one which comes to mind is when Wolverine walks through the metal detector and it doesn't beep. He looks back in confusion, expecting it to go off. These were great but were far to few.Now for the not so good points.Repetition. How many times do we need to hear 'We need to stop Mystique or it's the end of all mutants!?' in some form or another. You see this visually in the past with the older X-Men getting killed off. You don't need to keep telling the audience this as it's what we're seeing! Also, 'Mystique's DNA is the key', 'They can't get Mystique's DNA or else (you guessed it), it's the end of all mutants!'. This got old really quickly and unfortunately I came out of the theatre more frustrated than anything, forgetting the good parts that I liked.Hollywood seems to think scripts don't matter nearly as much anymore, thinking it can be covered up by fabulous special effects. This is not the case at all and I hope writers are allowed to be more creative instead of getting creativity and risk taking shut down by the suits sitting in their offices.Lack of action. We're watching this film for over two hours and the best action sequences you get is at the beginning! The ending sequences would have appealed to me a lot more if I hadn't been so frustrated with the script for over half the film.All and all, this is a must watch film - but I'll only be seeing it the once. Singer, please pass the torch on to someone else and get the fresh feeling back that was First Class."", 'Seamlessly blending old and new elements of the franchise together in one delightful package, X-Men: Days of Future Past combines emotional drama, exhilarating action, and surprising humor to create a wholly satisfying experience that ranks among the finest in the franchise.', ""Review By Kamal KQuite possibly the best of the X-Men franchise, both original and prequel reboots. The acting was amazing for a Sci-fi movie. James McAvoy's performance here was really good. The McAvoy/Stewart scene was pretty epic. I wish this was the last of the X-Men movies cause it was such a great bookend...but sadly they made more...crappy ones. Fight scenes were very good. Showcasing different powers were done well. Seeing the old X-men was very nostalgic and seeing their fates at the end was very heartbreaking if you ever watched the previous movies before the prequels."", ""Based on one of (of not) the best X-Men stories form the comics, this film is an absolute delight as an X-Men lover like me. As someone who's favorite movie is Back To The Future and loves timetravel movies, this is basically my dream movie with the perfect cast, story and execution.The combination of the old and new X-Men was just perfect. We finally have a good Friends Of Humanity story in a movie containing Sentinels.They made the right choice to let Logan go back in time though Kitty's powers, instead of Bishop through a timemachine like they did in The Animated Series.This is hands down my favorite X-Men movie, with Logan, X1 and X2 closely behind."", ""'X-Men: Day's of Future Past' has a great deal of potential. It's the first comic book film in a long while that feels as close as one of these films can to being a fully realized story with convictions and characters. This is no small feet at all. There could very well be a four star film in the DNA of 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. It has brave ideas about destiny and it tackles them in smart ways that are deeper than most other comic book films. The problem with this film is that it exists in the same climate that has given us 'The Avengers'. 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' should exist as it's own entity because it would strengthen the film and it's message. Unfortunately I feel that like it's equally excellent predecessor 'X-Men: First Class' that this film can't quite reach greatness because of the confines of a franchise. Ideas inevitability fall second fiddle to action figure characters, video game dialogue in the action scenes, and worst of all the need to make endless sequels...'X-Men' has the benefit of longevity and it really can be a benefit. One great thing about this film is that it knows we already have solid relationships with these characters by this point in the series and it doesn't need to introduce us to them again. This is a great relief. What it does need to do though is do new things with the characters. I think some slack is given to these 'X-Men' films because they have such perfect casts. Maybe it is merely a matter of prejudice but I am drawn to Magneto the most and I felt this film is one of the worst in getting the essence of this character correctly out of all the 'X-Men' films. I love 'First Class' in that it took the time to really explore the friendship of Charles and Magneto but because of sequelitis these two had to have their lines drawn in the sand by the end of the film. I wish we could have visited Magneto with a fresher take and explore some of the intricacies of his personality. Sequelitis doesn't let us do this however. Magneto has to be a villain capable of holding up a tent pole franchise. It doesn't give the audiences or Michael Fassbender credit. And I have no complaints about Fassbender, he's brilliant but the character needs work in this script. I felt it didn't do anything new with the characters. I thought the choices in the script really made Magneto look really stupid. I like the fact that the film doesn't follow the crappy tropes used in time travel films but Magneto doesn't listen to the warning of the future even though he believes it. I hate the fact that as soon as Magneto enters the peace conference that he starts up a huge ruckus that gives Trask exactly what he wants to get government support for the sentinel program. Magneto has always had this anger but it's been a righteous anger. He isn't someone who goes out and throws all his cards on the table as he does in this filmI find that like in my review of 'First Class' I have to put a lot of criticism into my discussion of the ending. The last two X-Men films have been good until the endings where they need to hint a sequel with a wink in the eye. Doesn't the movie not work at all if you don't have either Magneto or Mystique there at the school when Logan wakes up in the present? The whole point of the movie is that people are not shackled to destinies that cannot be avoided. We are supposed to have faith in these characters that they could be redeemed and choose a more righteous path. In the end by their omission from that final scene we are lead to believe that they don't make the right choice presumably so you could have them back as villains in a sequel. And then we find out that this movie which was supposed to be about redemption is just another comic book film about nothing but making sequels.These seem like rough criticisms and to be fair they are. They are big detriments to this film. However like 'First Class' what the film gets right it excels at. The acting is all top notch even with the characters with lackluster motivations. The films' strong central concept of destiny is so brilliantly dealt with that I feel cheated with this ending. This may be why I love 'X-Men' because they are so much about themes and ideas. I get the feeling though that some at Fox don't think we are smart enough to be trusted with ending those ideas on their natural conclusion."", 'I think that pretty much sums up the execs attitude when making this film. Great cast, excellent performances, spot on effects. Too bad the script was dog food. Lets start with the end of Xmen Last stand. Professor Xavier is killed right? Well the post credit scene suggests his consciousness survived. Although, we hear his voice, we don\'t actually see him (Patrick Stewart) cause it would be a whole new body, yes? Next comes Xmen Origins: Wolverine and First Class, nothing that ties this together. While X3 does close the book, it seems, on Scott and Jean, the fate of Charles Xavier is an unresolved issue. Third film comes in, the Wolverine, and again nothing...except, wait. The return of Magneto and Professor X. Wolverine is as stunned by this as we\'re supposed to be. But it eludes to the upcoming DoFP. So we open in a dystopian future where, ta da, there\'s Charles. No explanation or anything. 8 years and 4 films, and they fail to resolve this issue. By the way, that Wolverine end scene was as if that never happened, because DoFP takes place 8-10 years later.I also found it a contrived plot device that time moves in sync, essentially time passes minute by minute in the past for wolverine as it does in the future. Ergo, Logan ages six hours in 1972, he ages six hours in the future (guesstimated at 2022). I would conservatively put Logan\'s sojourn into the past to be roughly a week. So for one week solid kitty pride is kneeling over him doing the time-phase thing the ENTIRE TIME. I guess she doesn\'t need to eat, sleep, or poop. Lets also not forget there are a dozen mutants just hanging out all this time. In a world of super sentinels, you\'d think they would want to stay mobile, keep moving. I\'d like to know, wtf happened to the world to have a future like that, cause I must of blinked and missed it. X3 and the wolverine left the world in a good place for humans and mutants. Then ker-pow, now we use robots from the 70s? Funny, sentinels were never mentioned in the original films, save for a make believe scenario in the danger room in X3. Yet here they are. In fact, in the year 2000, it seemed the world was just waking up to the idea of mutants. Ohhh that\'s right, apparently as of now NONE OF THOSE FILMS EVER HAPPENED. I guess wolverine never gets his adamantium then. Ohhh wait, how did he have adamantium claws in the future when he lost them in the Wolverine?Xavier suddenly being alive is never explained. The serum he uses to walk again is horribly contrived. It\'s supposed to explain why we see him walking around in the flashback sequence in X3, as well as the cameo in Origins, but fails. He can walk at the expense of losing his powers. Well, he used them in X3 and Origins. And even so, if the serum later got ""perfected"", why wouldn\'t he use it all the time then? Furthermore, if the serum repaired his back, it did nothing for what happened to him at the end of this film where the steel beam crushes his legs. While seeing certain characters fully realized (iceman using his ice- slide), the film lost its soul. What made the original films so great where how the characters connected with the audience, the social/moral implications of being ""different"", and the whole judgement, acceptance, and belonging that was such a heavy element to these films has been watered down into movie action schlock. If this film had any real emotional weight, it would of been all those characters in First Class being killed off by the government and the horrible experiments they performed on them. But since this happened off camera and just given a mere mention in this film, the audience is significantly less impacted. ""awww, why they have to go and kill off Banshee?"" vs, ""OMG, you mother ******s, how could you? Avenge him!!!""Although the original films were always set in ""the near future"" there were never any elements that made it seem too futuristic. Like the 3d map in the first film, nothing like that existed but it was easy to see us progressing there. In other words, the world felt very real, grounded, believable. Now, it\'s 8-10 years after X3, and we got giant lasers, space ships, a re-imagined NYC skyline, etc. Like aliens in an Indiana Jones film, these things felt out of place. Then, we use Sentimels, which is far beyond our current technology and have them first invented in 1972? So before we even have the same technology that brought us Atari and cassette players, we have advance cybernetic hunter/killer robots? I get how putting metal in them while they were being shipped allowed Magneto to use his mutant power on them, but doesn\'t explain how he was able to reprogram them. He talks and they obey him, makes no sense....ahhhhh shut up and eat your popcorn. Ohhh, one last thing: Dear studio execs, please consider your largest demographic when choosing which characters bare butt to show off.', ""2014 has proved to be a successful year so far for Marvel with 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' and the most recent 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. Bryan Singer returns for the most recent X-Men after being absent for the past four films, and what a return he has made. 'Days of Future Past' is truly an impressive and spectacular instalment in both the 'X- Men' franchise and the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, combining the casts from both the original trilogy and the prequel allowing the audience to view the 'X-Men' in the past, present and future. The action scenes are intense and spectacularly choreographed with some fantastic heroes and foes fighting both against and alongside each other. As a personal opinion, 'Days of Future Past' is the best film to have graced the Marvel film franchise and one of the greatest superhero films of all-time. A visually stunning and exhilarating flick that combines the best elements of the series to create a fantastic and entertaining film.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters."", ""My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once."", ""To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\nThe movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator."", 'Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn\'t work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn\'t seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn\'t go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can\'t find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn\'t be able to track their most important ""weapon/creation""? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don\'t get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it\'s practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn\'t seem logical. At least it didn\'t feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.', '7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn\'t quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it\'s stunning with all of Edwards\' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it\'s trying to tackle, especially in today\'s world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie\'s head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.', ""With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script."", ""In a world where a mess of a film like Oppenheimer is praised as a masterpiece and a genuinely well told story like The Creator is torn apart for minor flaws, one thing is clear: You can't trust reviews anymore. I avoided this one for a while thanks to other reviewers, but it turned out to be one of the better movies I've seen in a while. Yes, it's predictable, but so is everything else if you've seen more than 10 movies in your life. This isn't the Sixth Sense. It's a moving and generally well told and acted story of redemption that takes place in an impressing array of settings in a thoroughly detailed and imaginative world. If you've been avoiding this one due to the lukewarm reviews I'd recommend giving it a shot. For reference other movies I love include Gattaca, Bladerunner, The Fountain, Fearless, and Edge of Tomorrow."", '*C+*, where ""AI"" is simply the ""Rodger, Rodger"" droids from Star Wars. If the future is androids more incompetent than humans than humanity should have nothing to fear. I always worry when a movie has too many big creative roles fulfilled by the same person. There\'s just no one to pump the breaks and point out when things get too ridiculous: Screenplay, Story-by, Directed-by, and Produced-by Gareth Edwards. Real SciFi deals with actual science and, ideally, it\'s impact on society. A story about the impact of artificial intelligence and real intelligence made from nonbiological means would\'ve made a great movie.', ""The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."", ""Of all the epic sci-fis we've been fed, this one is, by far, the most satisfying. It won't beat the OG Star Wars trilogy or the new Dune installement, but it will, for sure, beat movies like Netflix's Rebel Moon or others in the like. It's a classic father figure taking care of, and leading, a child but set in a beautiful world that, to a point, could almost be ours one day. It starts with the feeling of another Terminor story but leads into something quite different, something of its own. Liked it more than I first expected and woukd definately watch it again for sure. Don't go in with any expectations and enjoy!"", ""As the title says. I wanted to like this movie and the world it attempted, but the plot just seems like A. I. had been used to write it.Intruiging elements of the story, and world that it tried to build, seemed to have been passed over in favour other less important elements, or perhaps they just ended up on the cutting room floor.The third and final act of the movie also seemed very rushed to the extent that it seemed nonsensical. How did they get onto the Nomad station so easily, and take it down what seemed like such relative ease?As a result, it just felt like there was this huge pacing imbalance from one part of the movie to the next.It seemed like in order to try and make the movie meet a certain run-time, they had to cut a whole lot of explanatory or world building elements out.It almost seems like there could have been two movies worth of story, but they didn't have enough confidence in the material that a second movie would have been green-lit.Whereas Rogue One had been written and filmed within the context of being a story set within the greater Star Wars universe, it feels like The Creator was written in the same way, but we had no pre-existing universe to work with."", ""Ive seen some garbage in my time but this one takes first prize. Absolutely insulting storyline for anyone over the age of six. I honestly cant find the words. I dont mind suspending my disbelief but none of it makes any sense. Shame on the whole shebang. The moments when the ai bots all train their laser sights on the very kid theyre trying to save is a particularly sweet moment and the running bombs? Whats that about? Very effecftive weaponry in the future, what? How the hell it left the kitchen i'll never know. Talk about treat your audience like crap. Even the special effects arent enough to distract and thats saying summat. Big fat zero from me. Hang your head mr edwards. Big budget, small pen.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The storyline follows a planet eater out for a stone that will allow him to travel throughout space and time to find planets to consume. The ancient animal transformers protect the stone and have traveled to Earth to hide themselves and the stone. When autobots that support the planet eater arrive on Earth to find the stone the transformers and animal transformers will need to work together to protect the stone.This movie is directed by Steven Caple Jr. (Creed II) and stars Anthony Ramos (In the Heights), Dominique Fishback (Judas and the Black Messiah), Dean Scott Vazquez (In the Heights), Tobe Nwigwe (Mo) and Michael Kelly (Dawn of the Dead).This storyline was really compelling and interesting. It was tremendous watching the animal and car transformer worlds combine. The CGI and special effects were outstanding and every action scene is a 10/10. I really adored every fight. However, we didn't need the humans in this at all, and the action, dialogue and plot points involving Ramos and Fishback were painful. They are good actors whose performances weren't good here and felt out of place. It's time to move on from the humans needing to be the heroes in these storylines...because the Transformers, both good guys and bad guys, were awesome.Overall, this is a worthwhile addition to the Transformers series that I would strongly recommend. I would score this a 6/10."", ""Most of this movie is boring, even when there is action on the screen. The first 1h30 should have been cut to an hour, and it would have been more entertaining. Up until this point, it was a middling 5/10 for me, just like the rest of these movies (bar 1 perhaps).HOWEVER, the final act/fight is honestly stellar - I actually sat up and properly enjoyed the battle, the fact that the people were actually involved (due to what I thought was a pretty neat, if cliché device).It actually felt like there were some stakes too, both on large and small scale. The music, both soundtrack and needle drops were on point. Just a pity that the rest of the movie didn't have this level of quality."", '""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" is the new movie based on the Takara toys that Hasbro exploited and have been brought to television, movies and comics. In this new film, the result is kind of almost bad, a soulless and simple script that could have been told in 90 minutes and not in an excessive length of 127 minutes that become slow. The performances are ordinary and the director\'s work does not stand out. The production is not used, the soundtrack has no essence and the cinematography is quite conventional. The biggest negative point is the costume design and the setting, since the film takes place during 1994 and fails to take us to that year, with the exception of some retro objects and extras that wear 90s costumes, the protagonists really look very 2020\'s. Another flaw is the digital special effects that fail to be entirely realistic, the green screen and After Effects giving themselves away for much of the length of the film. A totally forgettable production.', ""I usually don't write movie reviews. Since, I liked all previous 'Transformer' movies, I just couldn't stop myself from writing this one. The autobots and maximals did not fail in their visual effects and performance. What made the entire storyline weaker was the two lead roles They delivered quite a lacklustre performance. Was the director/producer trying to bring diversity to the plot? Every minute of watching them was making the movie taste bland. The onus is somewhat on the screenplay.and direction of the movie. Overall, the movie deserves 7/10 (if you like Transformers). For someone watching Transformers for the first time, it may be a disappointment."", 'The Transformers movies have always been more popcorn flick than anything. Huge Michael Bay explosions, some one liners and eye candy for the human actors/actresses. That being said, the last few movies haven\'t really had many memorable moments. Rise of the Beasts is no exception to that.The soundtrack is straight 90s rap which makes complete sense seeing as the movie is set in 1994. The tracks work well with the segments of the movie they\'re featured in, especially one particular moment of LL Cool J\'s ""knock you out""The cgi was pretty decent. I didn\'t really notice any flaws like I have with more recent movies like Fast 10 but that\'s to be expected with a highly CGI dependent movie.The acting left a lot to be desired from the human characters. The eye candy didn\'t exist this time around but I imagine that was done for a reason. The problem is I didn\'t care for either of the human protagonists. I felt more connection to the younger brother of the male lead than I did the lead.The Transformers are as entertaining as always and that should be the main draw of the movie. Bumblebee being sidelined for 90% of the film left room for Mirage to take the stage. There were a few good one liners from him but then they take him away at the climax to put on their own Ironman suit which quite honestly took away from the movie a bit.Unicorn was supposed to be the big threat here but never felt threatening at all. Instead you get the 3 henchmen who were dominating the autobots early on yet in the main fight are easily disposed of.Overall it was a good watch yet nothing memorable. A few good laughs in a mostly empty theater.', '(Rating: 6/10)\nThe movie has some entertainment value and even some moments where I thought this is what I came for. The Film took enough time to develop the character of Noah, the ex-military, but it got lost in personal struggles of the 90s at some point. Unfortunately, the story telling was forgotten whilst finding a job and paying bills.What I came for:\nI came for the battles. They are cool, powerful and exciting - yes, this is a transformers film. The sound effects, as always, are overwhelming. I also came for the (re) transformations. These scenes could go forever, I watch them! On top, there is always a new and mind blowing bot or villain or something else. Just think of the Dinobots in ""Age of extinction"". ""Rise of beasts"" brings in a kind of a mecha King Kong and, my favorite, a rhinoceros. Unfortunately, we didn\'t see much of the rhino bot..What\'s refreshing:\nThe well-known extraterrestrial futurism merged with the nostalgic elements of the 90s. Soldering of broken pieces from an old device, cable headset, presenting old school music in a way they did etc. The makers mixed the old new with the new old. It simulates a postmodern futuristic feeling. Of course, this concept is not original and seems to be a trend nowadays (guardians of the galaxy, flash etc) but it still let\'s in fresh wind, especially in the way they realized it. The next cool and rather unusial thing was the password. Very good integrated from the beginning.What\'s Disappointing:1) While Noah\'s character development was overshadowed by personal issues, Elena stays a complete mystery. Who is she? What\'s her story? Too much and too less don\'t add up to ""enough""..2) the use of unnecessary stylistic elements. Either they are too blunt or they are ""kind-of-copied"" - better said: unoriginal. They tell the story bigger than it is. A) the hunting scene in the first part: I was impatiently waiting for the shock moment. And it took longer and longer - didn\'t know I am watching a horror movie. I know exactly what the makers tried here and it\'s a little annoying B) when the autobots met in the garage with Noah the first time. It reminded me of the first transformers movie, right at the moment he called for the others bot to meet up. Did the makers think it works again?? C) optimus sacrifices himself in the epic final. So far so good. But then, in the very last second, Noah comes and rescues. Then, he can\'t keep optimus and everything seems lost again. Then again, someone came to rescue. This up and down is too much and left me completely disappointed. It\'s ridiculous.. D)...3) Optimus Prime is rather Optimus second (or beta?). I know that this film plays in the 90s, so, before Optimus met Sam (first movie), but still he has lived for thousands of years and I expected the typical ""I am optimus prime, now I am stating a wisdom about humans and the different evolution of our two species"". Instead, he was egoistic, blind, macho and, most confusing, following a human that he didn\'t even trust. And everyone seemed to defend his behavior! That\'s not the optimus prime I had in mind. I expected him to be strong-minded, a true leader, somewhat wise and sublime. But here - Meh.4) Very sudden convenient (for the plot) appearances out of nothing. It was easy to tell when the makers needed elements to continue their plot. The warp key created a gigantic warp machine on a big mountain where - straight out the walls - a huge army of bot soldiers appeared all that out of the blue.After all, it\'s entertaining, had good effects but was overloaded with trashy stylistic elements blowing up the story. The personal struggle of Noah could\'ve been shortened and who is Elena? Cool Rhino, cool Mecha King Kong, weird sudden appearances of bots, armies and the warp machine to be able to finish the plot.""Rise of beasts"" is not among my favorite transformers.', 'The formula that made Transformers 1, 2 and perhaps 3 memorable great, true classics";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"['As a generic action flick I guess this is sort of ok. For the new Guy Ritchie film its super disappointing. The only stand out aspect is Hugh Grant who is excellent. The rest, from storyline, acting, action sequences, comedy are all incredibly mediocre. Statham does his most basic Statham when he can do much more given the script and direction. Aubrey is ok, i think she was supposed to be funny though and she isnt at all, that isnt her problem because she is generally awesome. The other guy, was just filler, im not sure what he was even there for. The main thing though is the story, its just nothing, it could be a Steven Seagal movie it has no twists turns or surprises.', 'This time, Mr. Ritchie brought us a more conventional action comedy, of the genre of \' team of unconventional agents/thieves, endowed with unique and valuable skills, in a tough operation"", in the line of F&F: comedy, action, expensive car chases, guns, fights, sunny days, luxurious settings and stuff, and nice looking people.Obviously, with some sarcasm (the obsession of the J. Statham character for luxury and very expensive stuff is one of many examples that show us the story does not take itself seriously).The result is an enjoyable film, fun, fast and easy to follow, for a more general public than his, for example, extraordinary ""The Gentlemen"".All the actors involved are doing great and participating of the fun. However, a special mention should be made to Aubrey Plaza and Hugh Grant. They are carrying the weight of the movie and did a very nice job.One thing that broke my suspension of disbelief was the outrageously poor and unprofessional setting of the Madrid (Spain) episode. The fictional ""aeropuerto de Madrid"", ridiculous uniforms, car plates, and so on took me out of the movie. Thankfully, Hugh Grant brought me back to it.Overall: not a great movie, but one to have a good time.', 'As a Guy Richie fan, I was a little taken aback by the initial reviews of this movie. If you would like to be entertained, have a laugh or two and enjoy a break from this world for the length of this movie, then its great!! Hugh Grant is brilliant, almost steals the show. Jason Stratham, well, we always love his movies for the entertainment. The plot is fun, and strangely enough, if there was a couple of sequels to this movie, I most certainly would watch them without glancing at a review - much like John Wick. A refreshing movie, full of fun, action, explosions, gun fire and bad guys being taken out. Whats not to love if you want to be entertained? Its simple - all I ask of a movie is to entertain me for 2 hours.', ""I haven't had that much fun with a movie for some time. Aubrey Plaza steals the show. She just brings the charme, the fun and the sexiness. And together with Statham, Buggy Melone and Carey Else's the team was perfect.Casting Hugh Grant again after The Gentlemen is just genius. That man knows how to play those creepy but cool and unique roles.I might not be Ritchies best movie, but damn, if you loved The Man From Uncle, James Bond or the Mission Impossible series, this movie was made for you. With some really funny lines from Plaza, this movie is the perfect start for a hopefully better year 😬"", ""It's an action, thriller movie. A really nice movie but the plot lacks somethings and the pace of the movie is a bit too fast that you might lose some stuff!On the other hand, Hugh Grant and Aubrey Plaza did great, the best actors in the movie honestly specially Hugh...\nHugh was funny, a bit foolish but ended up to be so cool...\nJason was the same old him, but this time very boring and his character could do way more than just killing some people..\nJosh was fine, could be better!The movie overall is a nice action movie, re watchable but Ritchie could do better in the plot! It's a bit less than wrath of a man! Which was quite good!"", 'With regular co-writers Ivan Atkinson & Marn Davies, Guy Ritchie dumbs actioner ""Operation Fortune: Ruse De Guerre"" down so much that it woulda stunk but for some stand-out support performances - notably from Hugh Grant & Aubrey Plaza. For UK govt bod Eddie Marsan, Cary Elwes runs the private special agent trio of Jason Statham, Plaza & Bugzy Malone. Using movie star Josh Hartnett as an in, they must find out who arms dealer mogul Grant is selling a stolen uber-powerful weapon to, and foil him before a rival troupe does. Silly & forgettable it\'s Ritchie\'s weakest (bar ""Swept Away"") but with its global settings and the fine Grant & Plaza, it\'s still passable - just.', ""Caption says it all. Being one of my favourite directors, I can't avoid feeling that Ritchie has lost his magic, that uniqueness that he used to bring to all his movies. It has come to a point where he just repeats a certain formula, which works if you want to develop an entertaining product, but nothing else. And that structure applies to everything: the plot, the characters, the rhythm, the action scenes, the development of the story... You go into the film with expectations (Why shouldn't I? It's Guy Ritchie!), hoping for good quality, and you get something that is starting to feel generic, repetitive. Perfomances are on point, of course, the plot is interesting enough and the action scenes keep up, but still, you just feel that the film got through you without anything memorable to remember. I'm just waiting for Ritchie to return to his best shape, but maybe I'm setting the bar too high."", 'I\'m gonna make it plain and simple: I watched this in the cinema and I really enjoyed myself. The movie wasn\'t too long, and I had a quite a few laughs. Jason Statham will always be the same character kind of, but I don\'t care with these kinds of movies. He\'s just a lot of fun. I have to give extra credit to Mr. Hugh Grant here. What a change in character after all these years of ""Type casted movies"". He is actually amazing and I am eager to see more of his talent in the future.The plot wasn\'t anything special, although they did make me think it would be. It\'s a shame they didn\'t dive into it more, as there were so many opportunities for twists and turns.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Perhaps some day Hollywood will re-discover the lost art of screen writing and combine it with CGI to create a truly fantastic movie. But don't look for it to change soon. A lot of people came out of the theater visually dazzled by the special effects knowing that the story was awful but still thought it was a great movie.

The female/mother character has bought into this and is about to send the world to oblivion. The acting is so bad and the actions of the characters ridiculous. Standing around while nuclear radiation is a few feet away. Or a monster is right in front of them. Leaving a submarine and standing on the tower while Godzilla appears, instead of staying submerged. And the search fo the daughter at Fenway Park. I have to give credit. It was certainly loud but like watching a Star Trek episode, I challenge anyone to really understand the science.

It fulfills one of my requirements of great films in that I walked out of the theater a different person than when I entered. And it fulfilled another requirement in that it improved with repeated viewings.There is so much to take in visually, intellectually, and emotionally that my mind was overwhelmed at the first viewing trying to sort it all out. Unlike the so-called ""entertainment"" we get today at the movies, this film didn\'t spoonfeed its meaning to you. It left the ending ambiguous so your imagination has to supply it.The film demands discussion. There are so many topics to debate. Is Deckard a replicant? Do Deckard and Rachel live happily ever after? Why is there a unicorn in the director\'s cut? Is Deckard a hero? Or are the replicants really the good guys? Every time I watch it, my answers change.I may be one of the few that really likes the original. Probably because I\'ve seen that version a couple dozen times since 1982 before the director\'s cut came out. This may contradict what I said earlier about being spoonfed, but I liked the narration because it explained what was going on in Deckard\'s mind. And I didn\'t mind the ""happy ending"" because it still implied that their troubles may not be over. ""I don\'t know how long we had together. Who does?"" But with that version memorized, I now appreciate the directors cut. It probably has the better ending. (At least I think so until I view it again!)It\'s also fun watching actors before they became more famous later like Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, M. Emmet Walsh, William Sanderson, and Edward James Olmos. I think they all did a great job. And Vangelis did a beautiful, moving score.After ""Blade Runner"", most of the big blockbuster science fiction movies boil down to good guys vs. bad guys with lots of loud explosions and in-your-face effects. Very simplistic messages, if any. That\'s why I still contend that an ""oldie"" like Blade Runner still outshines them all. It has incredible special effects, but never at the expense of the story. The cityscapes do more than dazzle you, they involve you.The more I think of it, the more I realize that ""Blade Runner"" is not only my favorite science fiction movie, but one of my favorite films in any genre. I wish Ridley Scott would return to science fiction, but then again today\'s Hollywood would never release a movie like ""Blade Runner.""', 'But it\'s almost like an art movie, the first science-fiction art film It\'s a futuristic film beautifully put together It\'s really impeccably made by one of the great visionary directors And you really saw a future that looked very different from the future you had seen before A future that looked very believable like the visual-effects shots of the flying car going over a futuristic city The fight sequence doesn\'t prepare you for the traumatic emotional side that there is in the film, it leaves you sort of brokenThere is a beautiful, delicate emotional great scene that I remember when I first saw the movie I\'m in the theater and I\'m so drawn in what Rutger Hauer\'s doing I\'m so drawn in by what the theme of the movie has brought us to The magnificent moment where he is letting go of life And in those last moments of letting go of life he\'s really learned to appreciate life to the point where he spares Deckard\'s life, and where he\'s even holding a white dove because he just wants to have something that\'s alive in his hands It\'s an amazing sort of crescendo that\'s going and there\'s Rutger saying: ""I\'ve seen things you people wouldn\'t believe. All these moments will be lost in time like tears in rain."" Hauer puts all the things that are so amazing about people: sense of poetry, sense of humor, sense of sexuality, sense of the kid, sense of soulScott brought out the best qualities in his performers He coaxed and very gently manipulated performances from his actors that in some instances I think they\'ve rarely topped You feel the story, you feel the emotions of the characters and you will be lost in the middle of this wild world, you know, it\'s so rich and it\'s painful I mean it\'s a very bluesy, dark story and told very compassionatelyThe overpopulation, the sort of crowd scenes is so rich and varied and there\'s such an extreme detail designing the magazine covers, designing the look of the punks, the Hare Krishnas, the biological salesman, everything is designed You have just Piccadilly Circus punks walking by You have a sense of layers in that society That is one of those things that you see again and again The city landscape with the big billboards à la Kyoto or Tokyo Scott was able to create the look based on what goes on in various cities all over the world Whether it is Tokyo, Kyoto or Beijing or Hong Kong or whatever, you\'re right in ""Blade Runner"" country""Blade Runner,"" to me, embodies the elegance, the power, and the uniqueness of a film experience It\'s the most classical, beautiful, purest movie-making writing and then the film-making itself is The images and the sound and the music, it\'s pure cinema Ridley came out with an amazing, brilliantly executed future of an absolute dystopia The intensity of his perfectionism on ""Blade Runner"" made the movie This is a master at his best.', 'Just my personal opinion.

It is clear that ALL the attention was given to the production design and overall look to the film, as the script (no matter the \'version\') is awful. For a film so raved about by nearly every critic, the plot is cookie cutter and drab. The pacing is, well, there simply isn\'t any pacing. It is S L O W. The characters are completely uninteresting and the film isn\'t deep or genuinely philosophical enough to warrant the attention it asks us to pay. There are many parts that are simply goofy and unintentionally funny, like when Rutger Hauer pops his head through the wall towards the end and says something silly, or when Darryl Hannah could have killed Deckard but instead decides to back up and then do a bunch of goofy gymnastics flips in order to give him time to pick up his gun and blow her ""guts"" out.

I wanted to see this because I saw a clip on television and someone saying this film was meant to be seen on the ""Big Screen"" and so off I went.

So much for lock down.The beetle suit (and OMAC) is never explained. It can seemingly do anything but how? Where do the bullets come from? How are they replenished? How is it charged?When they drain the suit for the code, they tell us repeatedly it will kill him. They drain the code, but he lives. So what a waste of time. A plot point that went nowhere.Blue Beetle doesn't want to kill. But the Uncle is willing to stab people with the bug mobile legs. Grandma machine guns down security guards just doing their job.The Uncle builds a localised signal jammer, and the building he uses it on with high-tech weapons inside doesn't hit the alarm when all their feeds go dead. Besides the fact that there was zero guards in the main lobby, and the blue beetle tech is in a display cabinet which can be picked with a paperclip?The uncle can pilot the bug mobile having never seen it before, just because he drives a truck. He knows where all the buttons are and how to do tight manoeuvres ."", '#bluebeetle #MovieReview Typical superhero movie. There is nothing new that this movie brings to the table. It is similar to other superhero films but now with a Latin flavor. It is pretty funny though and there are alot of Latino/Hispanic references. The film is for everyone but the word ""pendejo"" is used alot, so a small warning if you don\'t want little kids hearing that. The best part of the film was the family. The movie shines whenever they were together. Villains were not memorable or interesting. The love interest feels forced and not natural. The acting was good. Overall it was\n7.5/10.', ""Anyone who follows DC or even comics as a whole, knows how promising of a character Blue Beetle is in the comics-verse. Guy has been a featuring member of Teen Titans for decades, holding his own as one of the coolest drawn characters that has a very interesting backstory regarding an alien symbiote. The character had immense potential to be turned into a promising live-action film-series out of it. And frankly speaking, I think the cast choice was good as well - they could've pulled off the hype. The only thing that ruined this film, however, is the writing. It's terrible - felt so rushed and low-depth at some points that you'd feel like pausing to not continue watching anymore. CGI was bad for some parts too, but that can still be overlooked as most of it gets the job done quite well. But the writing, man, it's awful. DCU won't have much to build on if they continue doing such pathetic job at writing stories like this."", ""If you go in expecting a fun light hearted superhero movie that is what you are going to get. Only complaints are the tonal shifts. His transformation feels like a horror movie transformation and the hero of course doesn't kill people (rolls eyes) but that rule doesn't apply to all the other good guys. They violently kill and make jokes about it. One of its biggest issues is how it is supposed to connect to the DC universe going forward. It doesn't do anything to answer any of those questions. Then there is the racial undertones that seem unnecessary and hurt the movie and again push the us vs them issue instead of trying to unite people. At least it was sort of subtle and could be missed."", ""Everything about this movie is so clichéd and generic.And for a 2023 movie, it looks so average. And I can't believe Oppenheimer's production budget was less than this trash by 20m!.Mediocre acting , awful writing , laughable villain. Couldn't you try something different for the villain's motive?I think the end for the superhero movies becomes more clear with every new installment.I'm not asking for you to make a masterpiece but atleast show me that you are trying to provide a work that stands the test of time, I went to watch The Dark Knight just after I finished watching this trash and the difference is absolutely laughable tdk has better visuals and it came out 15 years ago! ( and the marketing of dc claims that their movies are the best since tdk with every movie they release)From this stage I will stop watching any new dc project until I hear something good about it."", 'Blue Beetle works well for what it is trying to be, a fun time a the movies that you won\'t be thinking about once you leave but during the time you\'re watching it, it\'ll keep you engaged and entertained for its runtime. The family dynamic works wonderfully and while a few moments can be a bit on the ""childish humour"", most of it came off as charming to me. In tone, it\'s the closest to the first Shazam film and a similar degree in quality as well. The suit looks great, the fight scenes are cool and the story is unfortunately, generic. The niche fanbase of Blue Beetle will definitely enjoy this one as it is one of the better DC heroes debut and a much big screen debut than a certain other, much popular hero dressed in red who runs fast. If you\'d have told me a few years earlier that I\'d have a significant better time with this than a Flash film, I would have called you crazy but here we are...']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"['Running man is an absolute classic Schwarzenegger film. If you\'re looking for a smart political sci-fi drama don\'t worry about catching this one. If you\'re looking for a dumb political sci-fi action flic oh boy you\'re in for a treat. In true Schwarzenegger fashion this film is full of cheesy one liners and almost nonstop action. The story is compelling while still keeping things on the lighter side. It still seems like we\'re only one more bad election from this being our reality. The same people who scrutinize action movies like this are the same people who watch children\'s movies and criticize them for being ""too childish"". It\'s campy, it\'s corny and i absolutely love it.', ""The Running Man is a cult classic, a film that didn't do so well when it was originally release, but more popular now. The Running Man has a premise that was later used by Battle Royale and The Hunger Games and easily stands along other dystopias from films of the era like Escape From New York and Robocop. It was violent, cheesy and had lots of Arnie one-liners. The Running Man was meant to be a satire about game shows but it's satire is more prescient now with the world of reality TV, 24 hour TV, and deep fakes."", 'I hadn\'t seen ""The Running Man"" since it was released on VHS more than twenty-five years ago, and I decided to give it another look when I found it in my local library\'s DVD collection. Seeing it again, it struck me how dated it had become. Now, there are still a few good things about the movie. It\'s never boring, there are a few funny one- liners and gags, and there is a great performance by Richard Dawson. However, more than twenty-five years later it\'s surprising how much the movie resembles a 1990s direct-to-video futuristic actioner. There are precious few ""wide"" shots, with the camera more often than not crammed close to the actors. That\'s probably because much of the movie was filmed on vacant lots and abandoned warehouses with little redressing, and the few sets that were built look incredibly cheap and cheesy. And the movie is quite jokey in tone, maybe in an attempt to get the audience to laugh with (instead of at) the various going-ons. Still, I have to admit that I often have a fondness for direct-to-video movies, so all this stuff didn\'t concern me that much, and I found the movie entertaining. Your opinion of the movie will depend on if you find cinematic cheesiness tasty or not. If you don\'t, look for another movie.', ""I first saw this in the early 90s on a vhs which I used to own. Revisited it recently.I enjoyed 95 % of Arnold's films n action films of the 80s but i didn't enjoy this one then n not even now.This one is very mild as ther r no brutal kills n the villains r more comic book style. Ther is absolutely no tension or suspense.\nThe film does have some good one liners, the yellow spandex suit is hilarious, the Christmas tree guy is a big lol but watch out for those 80s dresses n moustaches inspite of the film set in 2019.Check out for Lin Shaye as the propaganda officer and Franco Columbu as the 911 Security Officer #2."", ""Arnie in the Hunger Games, basically. Insert fire asf female accomplice, terrible bad guys and a pile of one liners and cigars, oh and the chief detective guy from Homicide: Life on the Street, and you've got The Running Man."", ""The Running Man is very silly. They use silly sound effects, the helicopter has a jet sound effect, the M-16s have hand gun sound effects, and there were a couple more examples I laughed about but can't remember now. The plot is a ridiculous but irresistible near future dystopian society that uses gladiator games to quell the masses and take their minds from their empty bellies. I've no doubt this movie would have been long forgotten if not for some very charismatic and memorable performances by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Richard Dawson. Jesse Ventura also appears with what looks to be a very bad toupee but isn't given much to do. My biggest pet peeve with this movie is the poor editing, we jump from scene to scene at times too abruptly. It isn't as if you'll have trouble following the story, but five minutes edited back in would have given the movie much better flow. Still this is an action movie and Arnold delivers while also delivering his trademark one liners."", 'Paul Michael Glaser turned this futuristic thriller from the pen of Richard Bachman (alias Stephen King) into a silly, imminently forgettable action film. Steven E. De Souza\'s screenplay has but one purpose, and that is to cash in on muscle bound Schwarzenegger\'s rising star.Arnie plays framed ex-cop Ben Richards, who is forced to participate in the 21st century\'s most popular game show, a sadistic man hunt which sees its ""runner"", or victim, forced to flee for his of her life from a group of very nasty ""stalkers"".Arnie\'s body passes the test of course, but the rest of this movie (which had a promising premise) is destroyed by some ordinary action sequences and an awful sense of humour. Schwarzenegger\'s one-liners are dreadfully painful.A real run of the mill, one-dimensional action film which delivers very little entertainment.Monday, January 31, 1994 - T.V.', 'Interesting - the movie is set in 2017 - the world economy has collapsed, television is controlled by the State, and no dissent is tolerated. Move that timetable up by eight years and you pretty much have the current state of the country. The clue to how prescient this movie was is that there\'s absolutely no mention of global warming. Obviously, the writers and film makers were only dealing with reality.So you have ""The Running Man"", depicting a dystopian society that has taken celebrity status to the zenith of empty headed and pointless mass approbation. It\'s fitting I guess, that if an Administration seeks to isolate a particular network attempting to practice real journalism, then television entertainment would be put under the aegis of the Justice Department.

If the definition of a classic is a movie that\'s often imitated but never equaled, then The Terminator is definitely a classic, because the increasing redundancy of its sequels and imitations merely demonstrates how good the original is.I wasn\'t fortunate enough to see this movie in the year of its release, the year predicted by Orwell\'s classic novel as a time when technology would be used to enslave people, but I did see it in about 1992, when the blockbuster success of the first sequel made me curious to watch the first film. At that time I preferred the second Terminator movie for being technically superior, but after all these years I now prefer the first film\'s raw intensity and kinetic energy.The Terminator was of course the breakthrough movie for James Cameron, and even after Aliens and Titanic it\'s still arguably his best-directed film. I challenge anybody to watch this movie and point out one single shot that needs improvement, because the direction of this movie is so fluid and precise that I can\'t think of one moment in the whole 100-minute running time that I would want to change.Cameron was and of course still is a notorious perfectionist who\'s very difficult to work with, but his perfectionism really paid off with this movie because it can be watched again and again without losing its entertainment value. He\'s a master of the small touch, as when the cop at the desk is filling out his paperwork with a small pencil and pauses in mid-sentence to look up and see the headlights coming towards him through the doors.Cameron also co-wrote the story, so this movie meant even more to him personally than merely a directing triumph. Supposedly he drew his inspiration from a nightmare in which he was being chased by a humanoid with one glowing red eye, and indeed the whole film has the urgent, oppressive atmosphere and calm logic characteristic of a nightmare. But of course he was probably also remembering subconsciously a couple episodes of The Outer Limits that he saw as a kid, which explains why he had to acknowledge the writer Ellison in the credits.Besides Cameron, this movie really belongs to the three lead actors. Arnold of course gives the performance of his career in this movie, but then so do Linda and Michael. Arnold\'s physical presence and harsh accent have never been put to better use in a movie, while Linda never had another role that required her to run through such a full range of emotions--sweetness and vulnerability, toughness and despair, etc.Michael has always been a B actor, but since The Terminator is essentially a B movie he fits in perfectly. His performance proves that an action hero is much more compelling when he\'s vulnerable not only to physical pain but emotional difficulties, to which his big, haunted eyes are put to good use. Watch him in this movie, as a man thrown out of his time but with a mission, and you\'ll see a perfect match of actor and character.In a typical action film, the amount of violence and bloodshed in The Terminator would be excessive, but in a movie about an unstoppable killing machine the envelope can be pushed. In one of the more memorable set-pieces, the Terminator takes on an entire police station full of thirty cops, and although I didn\'t exactly count them the viewer gets the sense of watching every single cop being gunned down.Ordinarily I wouldn\'t describe such a scene of slaughter as ""cool,"" and yet there is some-thing undeniably cool about Arnold, with his sunglasses and leather jacket, going through the station with a shotgun and assault rifle and taking on everybody. Arnold\'s charisma helps the audience stomach the cold-blooded determination of the Terminator, but also the character\'s single-mindedness invites admiration: even as we\'re appalled by all the killing, we have to admit he does it rather well.This movie has more than enough gunfire, explosions and stunt-work (including some especially good stunt driving) to work purely as an action picture, but it\'s the film\'s anti-technology paranoia that makes it more than just an exciting ride. Notice, for example, the subtle role that Sarah\'s answering machine plays in the story: the cops can\'t get into touch with her because of it, while the message she leaves on it brings the Terminator right to her.In one memorable shot, the tracks of a construction crane become those of a killing machine in the future, crushing an endless row of skulls, which you can interpret any number of ways (is it a crack against urban renewal?). Also note that the criminal psychologist is enslaved by his beeper, and that even in the post-apocalyptic future in which machines have destroyed the world children still huddle around a television set in a desperate effort to be entertained.Some viewers may be turned off by this movie\'s preaching, but one quality that distinguishes The Terminator from its countless imitations is the strength of its convictions. Too many science-fiction/action movies fail under the weight of their own camp, but The Terminator is an exception because it actually has the nerve to take itself seriously. The bickering between seasoned cops Paul and Lance provides some levity, but at no point does the film make fun of itself.The only reason I\'m not giving this movie a perfect 10 is because it is, after all, The Terminator, and not Casablanca. If people still remember it in forty years, then I\'ll give it a 10.', 'The Terminator is one of those films that no matter if you\'ve seen it or not, you\'ve heard of it, heck you know at least one or two lines without seeing it! This is the movie that blasted then new comer\'s Arnold Schwartzeneggerr\'s career, made James Cameron a name in Hollywood, and gave new meaning to a possible dark future that gave us nightmares. I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was just 8 years old and my dad of course walks in saying to cover my eyes at every ""bad"" scene with violence or nudity, needless to say about 70% of the movie he covered my eyes. Finally I got to see it with my mom and I was in love, this wasn\'t just an action movie, though it is one of the best, it had a story. To think this was all based upon just a quick nightmare that James Cameron had, he didn\'t have much money, but he had a good script, a great crew on his side to make one of cinema\'s greatest movies of all time.Two men appear in Los Angeles in separate locations, manifesting in sudden, blinding flash-storms of electricity.

I did not feel that ""Dial of Destiny"" gave a proper send off to the francise. It seemed like the first half of the movie is nothing but over the top chase scenes about trying to get possession of the Dial. That first half does not invest time to plant motivation so the viewer will even care about the Dial and who gets possession of it. Also, the Helena character is pretty unlikeable. Her passion is in the wrong place. Indiana is at odds with Helena for most of the movie. They do not make a good team. And then Indiana is a deflated version of Indiana that is kind of depressing. And to top it all off, there is no sense of fun and comedy in the movie. I hope writers have not forgotten how to write a good adventure story. ""Dial of Destiny"" misses the mark on many levels. And it kind of bothered me how much unnecessary killing there was in the movie. That is not family friendly. I wanted to really like ""Dial of Destiny"", but as the movie was progressing, I had to admit the movie was just not working.', 'What do the haters complain about? And why you should still watch this final edition.1 The first Indiana Jones editions were the best.This new edition has got the same spirit, the same amount of action, the same amount of adventure and I loved it (almost) as much as the early editions.2 The leading actress Phoebe is a disaster.My personal opinion is that she aint bad at all. She shines. And dont forget she doesnt have to carry this movie, Harrison Ford does.3 Harrison Ford has gotten old and grumpy.Correct. He has been always grumpy! And yes, he has gotten old and director James Mangold shows Indiana\'s old age in all of it\'s demise AND glory. Respect!4 There are no jokes. It\'s too serious with too many killings.Rubbish. There are still enough good jokes, but not the ""in your face"" jokes we were used to. But I love the more subtle, indirect jokes.It is more serious though and I LIKE IT.

I applaud his direction!I loved this edition. It had everything I needed in an adventure packed movie. It thrilled me. It made me laugh. And the final scenes really TOUCHED me and gave me goosebumps. I had a wonderful time watching this last edition!Just another solidly made Indiana Jones flick. Enjoy the show!Thank you for reading my 2000 th review on Imdb.', ""The plot was surprisingly good, as I was expecting some MCU multiverse hijinks but was instead given a more grounded approach to time travel. It felt like a breath of fresh air in that sense.Madds was a good villain. He had a cool backstory and plan in this film and was well-acted.The action was good. Not much with Indiana's whip, which is a bit disappointing. Then again, Ford is in his 80's so I understand. I enjoyed the action scenes despite their limitations.However... Phoebe Waller-Bridge made me wanna walk out of the theatre (not really, because I payed for normal tickets and was seated in a Screen X theatre by mistake). Her lines were awful. She ate food with her mouth open and came across very cocky for no good reason. She didn't seem to deserve to be the character she was. I hated her in this movie."", ""I mean Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) may have had its flaws, but still had a sense of fun to it, like an Indiana Jones movie should. There was very little of that here.1969 Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is quite bitter, is about to retire has a college professor and his marriage to Marion is ending, but his feeling for adventure comes back. When his goddaughter named Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) comes to him about a special device that could change the course of history.Some actions are pretty good, Harrison Ford is great has Indy, showing his old age catching up with him. And the de aged scenes are pretty descent. Now Pheobe Waller Bridge is so annoying to watch, her over the top know at all attitude made me want to walk out of theater, and she and Ford just never clicked. Mads Michaelson is pretty good has the bad guy. But the sense of fun just wasn't there this time, as the film started to get to the point, I was losing interest. Some moments I liked, but all in all I was just wanting this to end."", ""It was ok as a romp to not take seriously but it was spoilt by Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character, Helena, who seemed to be smiling incessantly. Very 1-sided character I disliked, and given the amount of screen time, spoilt the movie.Chases were fun if not ridiculous: would three-wheeled vehicles be able to travel that fast round corners without toppling over?I felt many of the action sequences relied too heavily on computer generation making them feel unrealistic. Some of the vehicle manoeuvres and the shooting of the characters within them didn't ring true and took my attention away from the movie.Glad there weren't be anymore, even though I grew up with Raiders."", ""I just returned from the theatre and now I finally have my own opinion after so many mixed reviews. Those who hate it exaggerate just as they did with Crystal Skull.I know that nobody asked for a fifth movie. But they made one and fortunately for us it's good. It truly is and it doesn't have to be perfect.There were three or four moments where I didn't like Helen. I believe the vast majority of fans know what I'm talking about and agree with it. The rest of the movie is fantastic, including the opening action sequence in 1944 with the de-ageing.The finale was something I would never have guessed and I loved it. No spoilers. If you're like me and you're worried that this movie might suck go watch it. You will enjoy it."", 'As a fan I wanted to feel joy and awe while figuratively traveling alongside Indy going on one last epic adventure. What I got was a big step down from all of his previous journeys, including Crystal Skull. Not to mention, as another commenter pointed, that deconstructing legacy characters/franchises didn\'t belong here. I think we\'ve reached a point where such approaches to franchises robs certain sequels\' purpose to any major series, which is to tell a story and not make it feel like some analytical term paper adapted in the form of a screenplay (eg Matrix Resurrections is a major guilty example of this folly).Also, when I said I wanted to feel awe and joy, this movie lacked those major attributes in exchange for melancholy and moroseness. None of the supporting even tried hard to give the movie any sense of levity. There was a kid, but he was no Short Round. In fact, killing off Mutt was a really dumb mistake. While he didn\'t have a warm reception, it doesn\'t mean he couldn\'t be improved in the follow-up, and killing him off was one aspect that brought the movie down. Oh yeah, he reunited with Marion in the end. But I didn\'t have any warm feelings of a happy reunion. In my head: ""Hi Marion. By the way, your son\'s dead."" It just reeks of studio interference. ""People don\'t like Mutt so just kill him off. I don\'t know how you do it, but just do it."" ""But I wrote a really good arc for him in the movie, and the fans are going to love him now."" ""Just do it already."" ""Okay fine. Jeez!"" I mean, he was only mentioned in conversation and then forgotten. We don\'t see a picture or him anywhere. Bad writing, if you ask me.Furthermore, the whole thing with characters dying on-screen made it a bit too dark and pointless. Why couldn\'t they have done something with time travel where Indy managed to save his colleagues and son from certain death. A nice Checkhov\'s gun moment. He goes back in time, and then...that\'s it. Would\'ve been great if a big chunk of the climax was devoted to Indy stopping the Nazi man from changing history in any other time period, but an underwhelming anticlimactic plane crash would do.You know what would\'ve been the best way to end the series? Atlantis! The ultimate lost ancient city teeming with valuable treasures and whatever mythical MacGuffin they\'re journeying toward would\'ve been more eventful than a time-traveling Dial that was lame. Heck! Since this is supposed to be Indy\'s last on-screen adventure, it would\'ve been great to Marion, Mutt, Sallah, Short-Round, and maybe another new travel buddy or two coming along for the biggest adventure that Dial lacked, and wasted it on an idea that was not fitting Indy (ie Just because it worked on Logan, it doesn\'t work for Indy). I mean, other than the Holy Grail, you can\'t get bigger than Atlantis. And they squandered it.', ""So much negativity ahead of the release considering the role of a certain female support character. Then lots of stories about early reviews being bad to mediocre at best. We went to see it today and honestly, I liked it.. quite a lot! This isn't a story about replacing Indiana Jones with a female character. This is a really good final film and a worthy send off for our beloved adventurer. Don't expect it to be as good as the original three films. Go in with an open mind and realistic expectations, and you'll walk out entertain and humming a famous tune.

I think i got it: they all got up in a bad mood in the morning, and, not wanting to be the odd guy out, set out to criticize every flaw this movie has. Which has plenty. But, again, what\'s the problem? it has the same flaws the previous three movies had: underdeveloped characters, uneven rhythm and a ludicrous plot that tries to handle a hell lot more than it can in just about an hour and a half of running time. But somehow, the first two movies get a pass from critics and fans alike, while ""the last stand"" and this one get ripped to pieces.I mean, this movie has it\'s share of flaws, but has plenty to like too: Hugh Jackman plays this character he knows so well to perfection, as Liev Schreiber does with Sabretooth, the action scenes are nicely done, and quite exciting, an quite a lot. The rhythm picks up exactly when it needs too whenever it falls behind, etc.People are even complaining about the quality of the effects which leads me to believe most of them saw nothing but the unfinished leaked version and, if they did attended the screening of the actual finished film, they didn\'t pay attention to it and instead, spend their time thinking ingenious ways how to use the title to mock the movie.So, in a way, this is the ideal kind of movie: if you\'re looking for a fun unpretentious and well done, if not perfect, summer movie, this is it.

Although the initial reviews for the movie had been good, negative reviews had soon started pouring through the floodgates. However, everyone at my college who had seen it was raving about it, some even going as far as calling it the best film in the ""X-Men"" series. So my vote could have gone either way.As it turns out, I\'m in the middle on this one. Thankfully, ""Wolverine"" is an enjoyable film, and far from the disaster that many critics have labelled it. However, apart from a few moments, it lacks the cinematic verve to boost it up to the high level of other comic book movies such as ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"". If you asked me to compare it to the other X-Men movies, I would say that it was on the same level as X-Men 3 (yes, I liked X3), but below X-Men 1 and 2.Before I dive into the main review, here\'s a summary of the film\'s plot. After a domestic incident, brothers Logan and Victor flee their home. Both have mutant abilities which allow them to live forever and recover from nearly all wounds (also, Wolverine has bone claws which pop out of his knuckles and Victor has sharp fingernails and fangs). After fighting in wars from the American Civil War to the Vietnam conflict, Logan (played as an adult by Hugh Jackman) and Victor (played as an adult by Live Schreiber) are approached by Major William Stryker (Danny Huston). Stryker has discovered the pair\'s mutant abilities, and offers them a place in his covert ops team. However, after witnessing some of the group\'s more vicious activities, Logan quits to live a life of peace and quiet in the Canadian Rockies with his girlfriend, Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). However, Stryker and an angry Victor aren\'t far behind, and when tragedy strikes, Logan wants payback\x85 ""Wolverine"" has quite a few flaws, some bigger than others. Wade ""Deadpool"" Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), Remy ""Gambit"" Labeau (Taylor Kitsch) and Chris ""Bolt"" Bradley (Dominic Monaghan) are three examples of characters who are underused. Concerning Deadpool and Gambit, if you can\'t find a significant role for a fan favourite in one movie, wait until another movie where you can! Deadpool and Gambit suffer the same fate here that Venom suffered in Spider-Man 3. Time to learn, Hollywood. Also, the script is littered with plot holes. The plot point concerning adamantium bullets is an incredibly lazy way of linking ""Wolverine"" to the plot line of the original trilogy. The lack of originality in the story and some dodgy special effects are just two other things to criticise.However, there is still a lot to like. As the big man himself, Hugh Jackman is top-notch. He not only captures the internal struggle between Logan/Wolverine\'s human and animalistic sides beautifully, but he also manages to capture some genuinely poignant moments in what is essentially a big, loud blockbuster movie. Liev Schreiber (who lit up the recent Holocaust drama, Defiance) is also great as Victor Creed. Schreiber is vicious without going over-the top, witty without being pretentious. Both Jackman and Schreiber are the glue that holds this film together. Probably the most successful aspect of the movie is the love-hate relationship between Wolverine and Creed, which somewhat reflects the duel between Batman and the Joker in The Dark Knight. As the scheming Stryker, Danny Huston delivers an intriguingly devious portrait of a villain who the audience will love to hate. Lynn Collins gives a memorably vulnerable yet sensual turn as Logan\'s romantic interest, and rapper Will.i.am is surprisingly good in his movie debut as teleporter John Wraith. As mercenary Wade Wilson, Ryan Reynolds seizes your attention for every moment that he\'s on the screen. He is perfectly deadpan, cool and has one moment which pretty much defines the ""giddy schoolboy"" term, when he takes on 12 guys with machine guns when he has just two swords. Taylor Kitsch is suitably charming and charismatic as the roguish Gambit, whilst Dominic Monaghan elicits a beautifully understated sadness as Chris Bradley, who is cruelly called a freak. Overall, ""Wolverine"" doesn\'t let the side down when it comes to above-the-call-of-duty acting in comic book movies.In terms of action, Wolverine doesn\'t disappoint. All of the action sequences are exciting, with a thrilling chase sequence which involves Logan being pursued by jeeps and a helicopter a stand-out. Aside from a few slips, the visual effects are effective. The cinematography is wonderful (a portion of the movie was shot in New Zealand, which, as Lord of the Rings proved, is a beautiful landscape for movies), whilst Harry Gregson-Williams creates a solid musical score. The script also contains funny moments of wry humour (such as Logan coming to terms with his new, metal claws), some unexpected cameos from ""X-Men"" favourites and some subtle nods towards the events of the original trilogy (Logan\'s fear of flying etc).And the final question that I have to ask myself is";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"['I have been at the World Premiere of 300 in Berlin where I watched this fantastic movie \x96 a movie not only for MEN! I got sucked in from the very first moment! I don\'t want to say too much about the story itself\x96I don\'t want to spoil anything for you. But let me explain that this kind of movie isn\'t usually my cup of tea. But when I saw the first trailer I knew I wanted to see it badly. And 300 didn\'t disappoint me\x96it was even better than expected.From the very first moment, you can see the fantastic colors and the amazing visuals. I got hooked. I loved the way how the film sped up and slowed down at some certain key moments. It was stunning!!! There were moments where the music set in and shivers and adrenaline were running thought my body. Moments where I held my breath. Sometimes I had to hold myself back not to scream out loud ""YEAH!"" You can see how much this movie sucked me in.The battle scenes: I feared them, because I hate too much violence in a movie. But they were stunning. These scenes were incredibly beautifully choreographed. These scenes gave me the feeling of a choreographed dance of warriors. Beautiful to watch. Powerful, aesthetic and elegant. Yes, they were brutal (without a doubt\x96sometimes I had to hold my hand before my eyes \x96 but only for a short moment because I didn\'t want to miss something) but they still were amazing. And all this slowing down and speeding up makes these scenes more tense more beautiful. And you can feel the adrenaline rush of the warriors.And in between these scenes there were this modern phrases like ""we are in for a wild night."" Some could say they don\'t fit into this movie. I loved it. It\'s incredibly cool and they made me laugh sometimes. And that was great";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The story is similar, but does change some major parts. The Flash is, for the most part, an enjoyable film with some really good performances, especially Sasha Calle and Michael Keaton. Not a huge fan of Ezra Miller as the flash, but the biggest issue with the film is undoubtedly the CGI. At times the graphics are poor, other times they are horrendous and unnecessary. The film would have been better had they taken a bit more time with the look of the film. Overall, a decent film with some suprising cameos, some really entertaining moments, but looked cheap.', ""I really didn't know what to make of this.. I was surprised by the tone, it is much less darker than the other DCEU movies and is tonally similar to Wonder Woman 1984.The opening scene for me rang alarm bells.. the CGI is absolutely laughable with utterly ridiculous scenes bordering of complete silliness. Superman 3 comes to mind. It literally features the worst CGI I have seen in a long time, it felt like I was watching an animated cartoon.The tone then shifts to darker territory briefly when the plot moves along, before suddenly jolting you back to the lighter silliness.Ezra Miller does an ok job in the titular role. He seems to be having fun with the character as does Michael Keaton, who steals the scenes when he finally appears on screen.There are many clever cameos throughout, however brief some may be and it feels like a nice homage to the DC movies of yesteryear.Overall, yeah the CGI was terrible and it tries hard and fails to deliver what Spiderman NWH did much better, but it's a fun ride nevertheless and I did enjoy it."", ""So after being in development for years, multiple re-writes and director changes, the drama behind the film's star and with the current DC shakeup THE FLASH somehow still manages to be an okay comic-book film.You would think with all the change ups between the writers and the directors there would be some inconsistency within the film, but for the most part there wasn't. Now the hype train dubbed this as one of the greatest superhero/comic-book films ever made, and it really does not reach those heights, but it is a good entertaining film with some depth and layers.Putting aside all the Ezra Miller wrongdoings, they are very good in the film. Miller's performance in the theatrical cut of JUSTICE LEAGUE to me came off as a buffoon who made lame jokes about brunch. ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE however, that performance was more akin to what I wanted as a comic-book fan who's read Flash comics. Miller plays two versions of Barry, one older who shows more maturity and experience and one as a young teen, who is a more immature version of himself. There is a nice balance between both performances, but I will admit young Barry's antics and jokes kinda did get annoying after a while.Maribel Verdu's Nora Allen serves as Barry's motive to go back in time to save his mother. She has some good tender moments at the end when Barry does realize he needs to let her death play out. Ron Livingston replaces Billy Crudup and does a good job with the scenes he had.I've been on record saying Ben Affleck is my favorite Batman because I loved his brutality, his rage, and his merciless attitude. To me a Jim Lee drawing come to life. He's only in it in the beginning of the film where an incredibly fun action set piece takes place. If this is the last time I'll see him (which it probably will be) as the character then I'm happy I got to see him just once more.Michael Keaton definitely brought back the nostalgia. In his old age he hasn't lost a step and has a solid role within the film. Anything with him is basically fan-service on overdrive, especially the Elfman Batman score and his memorable lines from the 89 BATMAN film. Since it is the mutliverse keep an eye out for some cameos near the climax. Sasha Calle steps into the role of Supergirl and I didn't mind her presence or performance but she was just kinda there. She plays an important part, but it never marinated enough for it to feel any true weight, but to mainly be there to serve the action at the end. She does have a nice fight with Michael Shannon's Zod.Piggybacking off that, I really did like how director Andy Muschietti honored what came before with what Zack Snyder did. He didn't blatantly ignore it which I appreciated. So even if seeing Affleck, Shannon, and some other familiar Snyder-Verse cast members for just a quick bit, it was nice that there was an acknowledgment of what came before.Now the VFX are very questionable. I know Muschietti said that the VFX was meant to look weird on purpose and I get his reasoning behind it, but it just looked way too wonky. Distractingly wonky that it took me out of the film from time to time.As for the future of DC, that's all up in the air, it feels. Original set photos showed Supergirl and Keaton's Batman showing up at the end, but that has changed. Anything can happen now, and we'll see whether that's a good thing in time.To sum it up, THE FLASH is an overhyped film that just happens to be a good/entertaining spectacle with a narrative that isn't exactly new, but the nuances give it that extra flare that prevents it from being a total nostalgia bait/fan service.7/10."", ""Only good thing is Michael Keaton. Ezra Miller sucks.... a lot! It's like he's in an elementary school play. There's nothing about his acting or the movie that doesn't suck (except Keaton). The way he strikes a pose before he starts to run is completely ridiculous. They should have made this with Grant Gustin. He is by far the best Barry Allen/ Flash. There's no chemistry between Ezra/Barry and Iris. The whole premise of the movie is an season of The Flash, the TV series, when Barry creates The Flashpoint. No originality whatsoever. I had to force myself to finish watching the entire movie, it was so bad."", 'Best DC film by a mile..\nFunny, endearing, finally a DC film with pretty good special effects too and although a bit silly in places it ultimately has got almost everything right.Ezra Miller is quite convincing and it\'s great to see Michael Keaton back as Batman but almost in a ""Hugh Jackman as Logan"" kind of role.There\'s quite a lot of this multiverse stuff these days and whilst this will never be as good as the Spiderverse take it\'s still good and serves very well to underpin the tragic human story element of the film.As good as most of the Marvel stuff and way better than the recent Marvel stuff..Recommended, go see it!', ""So here it is, the end to the high concept, but ultimately failed DCEU cinematic universe, resetting the timeline for a new cinematic universe, which will undoubtedly be much worse.The Flash starts horribly. We get a random and very silly opening action scene with Ben Afflecks Batman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman appearing for one final phoned in appearance and a lot of extremely bad CGI hijinks. Admittedly, I did chuckle at the baby in the microwave, but the tone is just all over the place.Once Flash moves back in time and meets his younger self, the film goes completely off the rails, with the younger Flash being unbearably annoying. While there is a purpose and a character arc to this, it still grates ones nerves. Ezra Miller overactings, trying his best to do the wide eyed clumsy-fasttalking-annoyingly-likeable thing that Tom Holland does. In some scenes he succeeds, in others he misses the beat. However, he does show some range, with the older Flash generally being a pretty good audience avatar and the one voice of reason.The film miraculously gets back on track once Keaton's Batman shows up. He steals the show in his scenes, but the inclusion of Danny Elfman's musical themes doesn't fit the mood of the film at all and just serves as a reminder of what a beautiful gothic opera the 1989 original was, whereas the Flash is a tonal mess from start to finish.As if the two styles of score weren't bad enough, they place some rock / pop song over a major action scene in a cheap attempt to imitate James Gunn's overuse of pop music in Guardians of the Galaxy.The story of the Flash actually turns pretty good as it moves towards the finale. The character arcs are brilliant, the teambuilding with Supergirl is good, and in her brief screentime she is excellent.During the finale, there are moments of real tragedy, and especially when Barry meets his mother again, the film is legitimately moving and quite sad. If it had taken itself more seriously, this would have been an incredibly powerful finale.One more note on Michael Keaton:\nSeeing his performance made me realize what a damn tragedy it was that Warner messed up the Batman IP this badly over the years. We could have had decades of Keaton as Batman, taking on a rogue gallery of interesting villains in Burton's wonderful gothic nightmare city. While Nolan's Dark Knight films were fantastic, Keaton just embodied Batman like no one else.Instead, they wasted time and money on the awful Schumacher films with Kilmer and Clooney (who's cameo here is actually fun), Snyder's failed take on Batman and the watchable but sterile and unnecessary recent series with Robert Pattinson. Warner were sitting on pure cinematic, iconographic gold and didn't realize it.The Flash flopped horribly at the box office. Was it deserved? Yes and no. The film is a tonal mess graverobbing past DC movies while unceremoniously killing off Zack Snyder's high concept cinematic universe. On the other hand, it has a good plot, strong performances and is still leagues above any of the junk Marvel belches out every few months.What does the future hold now? As the superhero genre goes the way of the Western (meaning it's dead in the water), DC will reboot and give us misanthropic garbage from James Gunn, which will undoubtedly be far worse than the past DC films, as it undermines every remotely emotional moment with a joke, be filled with popsongs, random family guy style humor, and probably fail within 5 years. Good job Warner.After the Flash bombed so badly, and with superhero movies on the way out, I doubt DC will ever get back on its feet in the near term. Batman will still be a success if they don't ruin the brand.Who knows, maybe they could do one more Keaton / Burton Batman or bring Nolan and Bale back. Anything other than Batman, and they will lose a lot of money."", ""Ezra Miller's performance of the flash was subpar. He is my least favorite hero in this movie. However, when Michael Keaton entered the scene, all hell broke loose and the crowd went wild. He was amazing and i would have much rather watched the movie starting from his story entrance and the movie being solely about him. He was phenomenal and made this movie. The supergirl Kara was freaking awesome too. The take on having a woman okay superman's role was genius and refreshing. I loved her character. Overall, it wasn't horrible and the kids didn't know any better acting for the flash so they loved it. I loved Michael Keaton as Batman."", ""The Flash has a bad script. The jokes are self-indulgent. The plot makes no sense. If The Flash can go back in time to save his mom from being killed by a mysterious killer, wouldn't he want to find out who the killer was and capture them? Instead, he just wants to swap out a can of tomato soup so her father would never leave home and she would be alone. Whatever. I'd want to know who the real killer was and capture them and a superhero would too.Suddenly, there are two Barry Allen's and most of the film is cringe annoying dialogue between the two of them that mostly isn't funny.Thankfully, the film picks up when they have to stop General Zod from the Man of Steel, and to do that they have go find more superheroes and the only who who exists in this new reality is Michael Keaton's Batman. And...it's awesome to see Keaton back as Batman.Instead of having two dumb heroes, the film now has at least one hero who uses their intelligence, strength, deduction, and stealth to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Truly a cool thing to see, and easily the highlight of the film and if this is what it took to get Keaton back...at least someone got the job done.Supergirl also shows up and it's actually pretty cool to see two Flashes, Supergirl, and Keaton Batman team up to battle Zod.The final act of The Flash is ambitious and there is enough cool attempts to do something unique that it's hard to dock the film entirely. The real problem with The Flash is The Flash himself, and the writing. This isn't a well written film it has tons of bizarre logic and potholes and stupid unlikable characters...but somehow it all sort of makes something that passed the time and - if for just a moment - made me smile.But, they should have just made a third Keaton Batman movie."", ""Keaton was the only redeeming quality of this movie if you can call it a movie since 2 hours of it looks like a ps3 cut scene. Some of the scenes filmed on camera where actually turned into CGI for the going back in time sequences. If they already have the footage of the actors why bothers creating CGI composites of a scene I just watched?The only thing they needed to CGI was Ezra Miller, he's not a very likable character and seems weird for all these super hero movies to have no problem changing the actor every few years but I guess using Ezra was a hill they were willing to die on. I would suggesting casting an actor that doesn't have ties to sex crimes in order to play a virgin.Save your time and just watch Sonic if you want to see more realistic super speed running sequence."", ""A little of bit of a disappointment, but at this point this is what we are used to.The whole film felt very one note, from the very first 5 minutes into the film we are thrust straight into the journey and there's no point at which we can take a breath, just gives the film a very uneven feeling.On top of that, it attempts (badly) at the balance of humour/emotion, I.e it try's too hard, half the time it feels like either a kids film or a video game!Please DC just take a beat and revert back to the principles of 'DC Comics' maybe make a few origin stories that are grounded - instead of trying to copy whatever marvel is doing!"", 'The first couple episodes of the cw tv show ""the flash"" was somehow infinitely better than whatever this monstrosity was. The humor was dry and seemed like a poor imitation of the marvel franchise. Batman was not very batman like and lacked luster. Wonder Woman was practically baited in the poster for the film, she had probably three minutes of screen time which was still better than any screen time of the Flash. The other version of barry allen was weirdly childish and did not convey the humor i assume was being attempted. I would not bother wasting time or money when you can just watch the tv show.', ""It was ok, the only reason I liked it was all the cameos late in the film, and them bringing back 2 of the main Batmans' the 3rd one they brought back was highly unwanted and unnecessary. The downfall of the film is the main actor who has spent around 8 years destroying his image and career publicly. It is hard to watch the film knowing he is a woman abuser, and child groomer and thinking that Warner Brothers wants to continue using him as a face of their company. Ezra Miller also in the role continues to have the most unrealistic and completely stupid running form for a man who is supposed to be running at the speed of sound and the speed of light. From his bounding step running to his what looks like him trying to hug air. None of it looks right for the role he is playing.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It\'s a little off-putting having a downright farcical movie in an established cinematic universe. Thor: Love and Thunder is about as grounded as a Naked Gun movie, but for some reason the comedy rarely hits for me, where I can enjoy it in an actual spoof. I was surprised, despite the nearly constant attempts at humor, the crowded theater I was in rarely did more than chuckle. If they\'re going to make a straight-up comedy then they need it to be more laugh-out-loud funny. Of course comedic taste is extremely subjective, so I\'m sure some people enjoy laughing along. I just wish it was as effective as Taika Waititi\'s other films have been for me (including Thor Ragnarok.)The real problem with Thor: Love and Thunder is that it is so irreverent but they also try to tackle heavier topics. The film starts with the death of a child, it focuses on a major character dealing with cancer, and the villain is literally called ""the god butcher."" Going back to my comparison to The Naked Gun, it\'s like you are watching that film and the filmmakers expect you to feel bad about Nordberg almost getting killed. There is no weight to anything, and it undercuts any attempt at emotion. I\'d be genuinely shocked if someone told me they shed a tear while watching this movie, even if the humor lets up at the big climactic moment, though it clearly is trying for some real heart-tugging. I can take a light-hearted movie in the MCU where nothing of vital importance happens, but there are some important plot points, and that\'s a problem.That\'s not the only problem with Thor: Love and Thunder, and I could probably go on a full tirade about many of the other issues. However, I will restrain myself and just hit each one like quick bullet points. The handing off of Mjolnir like a loyal pet kind of undermines the magic of the whole ""worthy"" thing established prior to this film. The quick shuffling off of the Guardians of the Galaxy is about as shoddy as Chris Pratt\'s hair in the film. The whole god convention sequence is atrocious and makes you feel like Gorr has the right idea. Thor has become as shallow and dumb as the version they featured on the What If show. The handing off of Thor\'s lightning powers to anyone at any time with any weapon makes him look rather selfish in prior films when they could have used a bit of extra help against someone like Thanos. The deus ex machina of the Eternity wish now makes previous plans of people like Thanos and even the Scarlet Witch feel over-complicated when all they needed was a quick trip with Stormbreaker. I\'ll stop there, but the really sad thing about all this is that it has taken less than 3 years for the MCU to go from a franchise where I couldn\'t bear to miss a single film, to a franchise where I might just skip out on some movies because the quality has dipped so dramatically.', ""A casual MCU fan would find Thor: Love and Thunder to be more than enjoyable, arguably having the most character development in any solo Marvel Project. I would assume the vast majority of fans would rank this film better than Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness but worse than Spider-Man No Way home. It does not live up to the standard of the last Thor movie but sides as one of the better MCU films.

Read all;"['In my opinion, many people do not appreciate this movie as much as it deserves because they systematically compare it with ""Planet of the apes"". Sure, it is a sequel, but it has the good idea to show us aspects of the POTA universe we could not guess watching the first movie. For example, the ""citizen council"" part of the movie is amazing and allows us to see why this sort of theater in Ape city was built for. The existence of amazingly complex submachineguns can make us suppose that apes copied human military technologies for centuries, and so on. To make it short, we go further. Plus, follow me or not, I think Ted Post\'s very classical directing aged much better than Franklin J. Schaffner\'s for the first movie. The ""sometimes bizarre"" directing of POTA is IMHO becoming a weakness as time gradually passes. It does not mean this movie is unflawed. Sure, from time to time, budget limitations are obvious, the first part of the movie is too much based on the first one, we don\'t learn enough about the mutant society and Heston\'s part, at his demand, is too short. But this sequel really adds something to the first movie.', ""The sole survivor of an interplanetary rescue mission searches for the only survivor of the previous expedition. He discovers a planet ruled by apes and an underground city run by telepathic humans.Although Charlton Heston showed little interest in reprising his role as Taylor, studio head Richard Zanuck thought the actor was essential to the sequel. After some disagreement with the actor's agents, Heston agreed to briefly appear with the provision that Taylor be killed and that Heston's pay go to charity. The writers decided to have Taylor disappear at the story's start and only return by the film's ending, and have a new protagonist for the major part of the story.Strangely, the switching out of heroes does not seem to have much effect. Whether it is Heston or anyone else, the lone human idea remains just as good. Now, the new humans are a strange addition. Accepting ape-people is one thing, but then to add a second mysterious race takes this another step and begins to distort the allegory. But it also creates plenty of sci-fi opportunities."", ""Good and frantic science-fiction movie with a first rate James Franciscus and special intervention of Charlton Heston who literally disappears in the beginning and re-appears on the ending .

Read all;"['Last night I was lucky enough to be one of the few to attend the world premiere of J.J. Abram\'s ""Star Trek"" at the Sydney Opera House. This red carpet event was every bit as surreal and magical as the film itself.The film in many ways matched the venue – unreal. You have doubtless heard or seen other reviews (as I have) and they probably say the same thing: this is (in every sense of the phrase) a second take on the Star Trek universe, from the beginning.From the opening sequence, JJ Abrams asserts his authority in a plot twist which will shake the very fabric of the Star Trek universe. In a sudden (plot) twist, the very nature of the film becomes clear: this is a new Star Trek.However, the opening sequence delivers more than just this ""statement"" - it also gives us a taste of what is to come: action, drama, solid performances and an outstanding introduction to a new era.Little by little we are introduced to the main characters, starting with Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Uhura as we briefly navigate their early lives including events at Starfleet Academy before hitting a plot crescendo which brings all the cast together – and to the starship Enterprise, NCC 1701! This is a movie strong on character development, and each of the actors deliver brilliant performances – nothing less would be appropriate given the shoes each has to fill.The movie moves along at an agreeable pace, never slow enough to be tedious, nor too frenetic so as to be judged another ""run \'n\' gun"" style sci-fi action flick.This is a movie with cutting edge special effects, but they serve more to frame the storyline and characters rather than to be the show entirely.Star Trek has always been tied to models and great visuals, so this is something which we\'ve come to expect from this groundbreaking franchise.Since I do not intend to introduce spoilers in this review, I can only really say that the crew of the USS Enterprise is brought full circle to face the film\'s dark enemy, a Romulan by the name of Nero who is portrayed by Australia\'s own Eric Bana (who is not given nearly enough screen time in my humble opinion).By now you\'ve probably heard that the movie also features Leonard Nimoy – reprising his role as Mr (please, not Doctor) Spock. This is indeed true, however you may be surprised to learn that this is no token cameo role.Leonard Nimoy\'s Spock plays a pivotal role in the film, and in a way bridges the franchise from the original series to the new film version. He also has delivery of my most favorite line in the film..Each actor holds their own with the roles we know so well. It would be unfair to single out any specific actor.. but I have to say that Simon Pegg and Zachary Quinto are simply outstanding amongst a group of very talented actors in a movie which is (perhaps a little surprisingly) carried by strong character development.In summary, this film is likely to appeal to a wide audience including die hard Trekkies and those new to the Star Trek universe. This is a must see film, even if you can\'t tell the difference between a Tribble and a Tholian!', ""So I managed to go to the world premiere at the Sydney opera house last night. While I will not ruin the film before its release by delivering a shot by shot review here I will say that JJ Abrams is quite possibly the smartest film maker on the planet. Managing to poke fun at some of the sillier aspects of the original series/movies while still being completely respectful, action scenes that easily rival anything in Transformers, and space battles that are breathtaking. Now let me just say that while I do consider myself a big fan of Trek in all its forms, i don't have a uniform hanging in my wardrobe and I cant speak Klingon, but having said that I will say the movie is F###ING AMAZING...!!! Honestly, incredible film, do yourself a favour and see it as soon as it comes out. thanks, the end."", 'Disappointing addition to the Star Trek franchise... The production values are Excellent. The acting very good. However, the STORY is yet another ""Go Back in Time and Change Things So We Can Get Away With Doing Anything We Want To Do"" story.Don\'t they realize how dissatisfying that type of story line is? Bringing the Bad Guy from the Future back to create problems only to create an alternate reality that the writers can play in is a very Lazy way to write a Star Trek story. There are many stories already out there that are much better...In ST: Voyager it was a lame plot device they used in The Year of Hell series of episodes.In ST: Enterprise the entire series was one big alternate time line... and they wonder why that series couldn\'t hold an audience ? And how about the destruction of Romulus? The Bad Guy (Nero) comes back and destroys Vulcan? Romulus was destroyed by a SuperNova... destroying Vulcan won\'t stop that from happening.Add in... Uhura throwing herself at Spock ?? Please...I could continue but I think I\'ve already wasted enough time on this movie. They should have selected a better story... but I guess it was good enough to capitalize on the Star Trek franchise so it will probably make \'em a mint - they could have made a lot more if the story was better....', 'I got an invitation for the Bulgarian (pre)premiere of the new Star Trek and I saw it on April 27. It is an OK movie, but I feel that Star Trek and its fans deserve more.The movie starts with a kick. Some huge and really advanced Romulan ship encounters a federation ship. The Romulan captain Nero is searching for Spock, but nobody has ever heard of him, and the Romulans lose their temper right away and kill the captain. The new captain is now Kirk Sr. who takes control over the Federation vehicle and sacrificing both the ship and his life rams himself into the Romulans, saving the lives of thousands of people, including his wife and newborn son - James Tiberius Kirk. Kirk the father flying towards his certain but heroic death while listening to his wife giving birth to his son, now this was some epic drama.We see James T. Kirk racing down a country road in a stolen retro car, listening to the Beastie Boys\' ""Sabotage"" while being chased by some flying traffic cop, which was a cool scene, though completely irrelevant for the story.We see young Spock teased and picked on in Vulcan school (I didn\'t know the Vulcan\'s have bullies at school as well) and having troubles because of having a human mother.Then as expected Kirk has grown into a rebellious teen/young adult, and he is trying to use his charm on Uhura at a bar, in the process finds himself in a fight with four Federation cadets, and after being badly beaten is recruited by his father\'s old friend Captain Christopher Pike.Little by little we see all the rest of the familiar crew - Dr. McCoy, Sulu, Chekov, Scotty and so on, and I admit that it\'s really fun to see them while they take their first steps towards the final frontier.And from this point on the movie is quite predictable, there are no serious plot twists (but there are a number of plot holes).Comes out that the Romulans are some angry miners from the future who are after Spock who didn\'t save their planet from annihilation. After seeing the end of their world they came back in time to get their hands on Spock, planning to destroy Vulcan and make him watch. Spock on the other hand came back in time hoping to make things right somehow. But the Romulans came like 25 years before Spock and when hey didn\'t find him it all ended with the death of Kirk\'s father.Now the Romulans are here again, 25 years later, back in tie with a vengeance, creating a black whole that engulfs Vulcan among with Syler\'s... pardon me, Spock\'s mother. Captain Christopher Pike is captured, they want him to give them some security codes so they can do to Earth the same they did to Vulcan, and it is up to Spock and Kirk to stop them. I mean... it is up to Spock, Kirk and Spock to stop them.The old Spock from the future is here now, helping Kirk to become a captain of the Enterprise, telling Scotty the beaming formula he is supposed to discover himself some years later, and telling the young Spock that he is actually Spock too...Guess what? All this creates an alternative universe. That\'s the excuse they came up with for the reboot.All in all, it is a good way to waste two hours, but it is nothing memorable. The main flaw is the unnecessary use of shaky camera and unstable frames. I know they use it all the time nowadays and we see it in like every action movie, but still it is not an excuse. I guess this is the way they want to create pace and make it more dynamic, but actually when you walk out of the cinema I wouldn\'t be surprised if you have a headache. The constant twitches are really annoying, and they were used even in simple dialog scenes. I really can\'t understand why they shake the camera so much and in some scenes it just made absolutely no sense. I mean, come on, you spent millions of dollars on sets and CGI, give me some static shot, stand still for a while and let us enjoy the view! Otherwise we have to wait for the DVD and push the Pause button, hoping that the creature or the spaceship will be on focus and we will be able to see some more details.Speaking of CGI for millions of dollars... they created black wholes engulfing planets and giant alien monsters chasing Kirk through a snowy wasteland, but they didn\'t add steam coming out of their mouths. When it\'s cold and you breathe there is usually steam coming out of your mouth I wonder why there wasn\'t any while Kirk and Spock were in an ice cave... It\'s not the only movie where they make this mistake, but it\'s really annoying when you notice it and makes the whole snowy set look fake.But let\'s point out some good things as well - fan service! The short skirt uniforms, Uhura is hot and there is a green-skinned Orion slave girl! Well, it\'s not like a blue Twilek babe, but after all it\'s only Star Trek ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

War historian Youtubers pick this movie to pieces. As they should. The inaccuracies and goofs are overwhelming for anyone with an ounce of WW2 military history knowledge.\nAs a military historian myself, I spotted errors within the first 5 minutes, BUT, I enjoyed this movie. It is WW2 war movie entertainment only. Military historians go to ton on this movie/... the inaccuracies are overwhelming... but it is a damn fine movie. The acting is superb. Fantastic film work, and what id o personally like is the German Tiger tank in the movie, is an actual German Tiger tank being the only fully functional restored Tiger in the world.', 'Alright so my immediate reaction after this movie ended was holy crap that was good. I was in literal awe of the films ability to portray the brutality of war and how when it\'s all set and done it\'s not a bunch of medals and celebrations. When it\'s done it\'s grief and despair and trauma after everything that just happened. They show how this affects people, how it turns good people bad and forces them to become something they\'re not. Then I went online and read a few things that said that they didn\'t care about the characters cause they were ""bad people"". In my opinion those people completely missed the mark of the film.This isn\'t a war film where you\'re supposed to like the characters. This is a war film that shows what war does to people, and what you have to become to survive it. Logan Lerman is the perfect example of that. His character Norman comes in as this scared shitless angel kid who\'s never done a wrong thing in his life. But over the course of the movie he sees what happens in war and how brutal it is and eventually becomes cold hearted and ruthless. That is what this film is. This isn\'t a ""let\'s root for these lead characters because they\'re the heroes"" film, this is a brutal telling of what actually happened during those wars and what it did to people.The other big criticism I saw was how bad of a person Jon Bernthals character was. That was the point, everyone handles killing people over and over differently, they need to trick themselves into believing they are the kind of person who does. That\'s what Bernthals character is.On a more technical note this film is almost flawless. Acting is across the board phenomenal, action sequences are stunning, music is perfect, story is top notch. I don\'t have anything negative to say her. Just incredible.', 'When one watches this movie you need to keep in mind that not all war movies are the same and the focus of the movie depends on who made the movie, how it was made and who is watching it? Make sense...of course not but in a nutshell keep an open mind. Is it about war? Yes some of it is. It is about bonding and camaraderie? Yes of course, it highlights strained relationships in very stressful and violent situations. I enjoyed the movie and being ex military in the 3rd Armour Division you do tend to pick things out BUT I could do that in just about any military movie I have seen especially from WWII to date. Without being too specific I spotted armor and infantry tactical strategies which confused me a bit but other than that I did enjoy this movie. War is ugly and this movie does not miss that point.', 'I can\'t make my mind up about ""Fury"". As an escapist war film, it delivers well in a clichéd sort of way. But is it a true reflection on what the latter stages of WW2 were actually like? I doubt it. This film certainly doesn\'t paint American soldiers in a good light, although after slogging their way across Europe for months on end, facing sense-numbing death and destruction on a daily basis, perhaps it is a realistic portrayal? I just don\'t know, and would be interested to hear the views of any veterans who were there.In many of the classic war films of the 50\'s and 60\'s, such as ""The Longest Day"" or ""The Great Escape"", when people were shot they just threw their arms in the air and fell down: sanitised death – – ""war is hell"", but let\'s not show it on screen. Spielberg\'s ""Saving Private Ryan"" rather changed all of that, with 15 minutes of the most visceral footage seen to date, which even D-Day veterans agreed was frighteningly realistic. Spielberg followed that with the remarkable ""Band of Brothers"", with some of the scenes – notably those in the Belgium forest – showing a realistic level of violence but more importantly bringing home the true mental anguish of war. Brad Pitt in (and on) Fury David Ayer\'s ""Fury"" differs from this masterpiece in two notable ways: firstly, the \'Tarentino effect\' seems to have been brought into play with a level of violence and gore that seems to have gone over the top: heads fly off and faces come off with gay abandon";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Being the first $100 million movie naturally the effects are remarkable for their time, but they hold up wonderfully against anything made today.It\'s the actors, however, who steal the show. Linda Hamilton can play insanity and despair like nobody\'s business, and she gave her all here.

Orlando Bloom was also very good and Archie Madekwe should Sue the trailer house for displaying his performance as anything other than stellar. The movie has some problems of course, some of the CGI is abysmal and feels like it was a mix of bad CGI and wanting to make it look like a video game at all times, and the end result is really distracting. Also the movie loves to just abandon characters that could really go somewhere.

Tom Holland has a great performance as a young, inexperienced adaptation of Peter Parker. And that's a great new direction for the character. I've always thought that SpiderMan shouldn't be great at being SpiderMan at first. Tobey Maguires adaptation gets bitten by a spider and within a day or two masters all of his powers. But this movie hinges on the fact that Peter is still learning how to be a hero. That's perfect."", 'After reading several different negative reviews, there seemed to be a lot of people complaining about some of the same ""issues"", but they all seem to miss the point of this movie, and the reasoning why writers do certain things differently. I have been a Spider-Man fan for over 10 years, and I enjoyed the Raimi and Webb films very much.People have complained quite a bit about how Peter Parker was portrayed throughout the film as selfish and his acts as Spider-Man were only done so he could become an Avenger, and for a portion of the film, this is correct, but it is not a terrible thing. Peter is 15-years old in this movie, he is a kid, and he of course is not very mature yet though he is very intelligent (he made the web shooters, answered questions correctly in class without having to pay attention, etc.) In a world where the Avengers are all over the news, of course a kid with super abilities dreams of being in the Avengers, and that is his motivation throughout most of the film. Peter has had his abilities for less than a year so he is still learning the ropes, thus why he is so destructive during the van chase scene. While many people complain that ""this is not how Spider-Man should be"", they seem to miss the part where the switch in Peter\'s head is flipped. The scene when the Vulture covered Peter in the rubble and he had to struggle to get out, he realized how strong he truly is, and that being a hero is not about being a ""cool"" Avenger, and that is not easy. This is when Peter truly became Spider-Man, this is when Peter cared more about stopping the Vulture because he is a dangerous threat, and not because it would make Tony happy. For the first time, Peter stopped thinking about himself, and that is when he became a true hero. This is reiterated when Tony offers Peter a spot with the Avengers and he turns Tony down. He wants to save lives, and be a real hero before he can be an Avenger.The high-tech suit is one of the most complained about aspects of this movie. Personally, I think this suit is a perfect way to integrate Spider-Man into the MCU. It makes perfect sense that if Tony Stark is going to take a 15-year old kid under his wing, that he would give him some of the similar technology that he currently uses. The moving eyes feature is one of my favorites, mostly because within the comic books, the illustrators used Spider-Man\'s eyes to express emotion while within the suit, whereas in the Raimi trilogy, and in The Amazing Spider-Man series, Spider-Man\'s eyes could not move on the suit, so to show emotion, his mask would have to be ripped off his face. The moving eyes technology is a logical way to allow Spider-Man to show emotion while in the suit. Also, the AI (Karen) was also complained about a lot. Again, referring to the comic books, Peter talked to himself a lot, or at least thought a lot while in the suit. The AI creates a logical reason for Peter to talk to himself while running around as Spider-Man without looking like a psychopath.Besides this, many people were complaining about the character changes. Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori) is complained about because he is a ""small Indian kid"", first, he is Guatemalan, not Indian. Flash was portrayed in a very similar way in the Raimi and Webb series\', it was time for Flash to be changed. In 2017, bullies are not just physical bullies anymore, they are verbal/mental bullies that prey on insecurities, and this makes a lot of sense for Flash to be this type of bully within the context of the film. A ""dumb jock"" type bully does not fit into the mold of someone who attends ""Midtown School of Science and Technology"". Flash hurts Peter\'s reputation, and makes him feel like an outcast, but the scene at the bus when Peter asks to rejoin the academic decathlon team and Flash walks towards him, Peter backs away from Flash as if he feels intimidated by him. Though Flash is not a huge guy, either is Peter, so up until Peter received his abilities, Flash was probably able to push Peter around.Another obvious character who was changed in this movie was Aunt May, but I think this is for the better. Aunt May, portrayed by Marisa Tomei is not as young as people make her out to be, she is 52-years old and though she is not 80+ like in the Raimi trilogy, this makes more sense that a 52-year old woman would have a 15-year old nephew. Plus, this gives Peter and his aunt more of a mother and son dynamic, and considering Peter\'s parents died when he was young and Aunt May and Uncle Ben raised Peter, having her seem as a younger motherly figure as opposed to a grandmother figure makes more sense for the story.The Michelle ""MJ"" Easter-egg was taken too literally. Michelle could be a potential love interest for Peter, but she is not Mary Jane, the writers as well as Zendaya have confirmed this. The MJ name drop was done as an Easter-egg, not as a serious character introduction.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. It was not perfect, but this was a great film to explain how Peter went from being an excited kid in a costume trying to impress Tony, to becoming a true hero. The humor was fantastic, the cast seemed to have true chemistry together, it was aesthetically pleasing, the soundtrack was catchy, the Vulture was one of the best MCU villains to date, and I am very excited to see what else Marvel does with the character.', ""I like how they contain scenes from civil war.

All star cast except for PP himself, still up and coming star, but great start to a very promising career Tom Holland. I love Micheal Keaton as the main bad guy Vulture. Just a bit confused as to where this movie takes place as far as Tobey and Andrew versions. Is it after both of their versions or somewhere in between.', 'I understand Marvel\'s desire to get Spider-Man back to his teen-aged roots. However, I think they made him too young. There is a growing trend with superhero movies to focus on the young hero learning to use his powers. They said this wasn\'t going to be an origin story, and yet is basically was. Young Peter Parker looks to get mentored by an older Iron Man, and has to prove himself worthy of the mantle.I disliked the totally mechanized suit. Spider-Man never, ever, had a computerized suit in the comics. Why? Because he didn\'t need one. He was a fully qualified superhero with just his powers, his wits, and his web-shooters.When the computer started talking to him, it became Iron Man all over again. JARVIS, er Jane (no, that\'s Ender\'s computer), er Karen was a distraction. Just totally unnecessary, in my opinion. And all the ""combat"" options, web options, etc. Too much.I didn\'t like the Vulture, either. I thought I would flip out over Michael Keaton in the role. But the character written for the film was not what I expected. The Vulture was always a solitary villain, perched on rooftops, swooping in to steal and kill. Now, he\'s a family man with a bunch of criminal buds.The first two Raimi films focused on the tension between Peter Parker\'s best friend having a villainous dad";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I went into the movie ""cold"", not having read the novel by James Dashner or knowing very much about the plot. For me, this was the type of film that I knew if I just went with the flow and didn\'t try and look for all the holes in the story and script that I\'d be better off.The way the film was presented by first time director Wes Ball was top notch, as I felt I was right there in the maze with the main characters. The obvious set-up for a sequel at the end of the movie didn\'t bother me too much as it seems like every movie of this type ""has to"" have at least one.In summary, I found this movie to be very absorbing and kept my interest throughout.', ""19 October 2014. The Maze Runner combines The Hunger Games (2012), Cube (1997), with Lord of the Flies (1990) into a rather fascinating mystery thriller for boys. For most of the movie, the consistency of theme and plot holds up well. The tension, the ever presence ominous sounds of the maze offers up a dread that is pervasively creepy. The stereotypical characters aren't usually overplayed and the over the top performances or plot points are mostly held back using instead more empathetic and humanistic portrayals.The ending seems like a cop out for a hoped for sequel unfortunately. And there a few moments that really do fall back into the stereotypical plot design. The humor however makes their appearances with to great effect though. This is more enjoyable movie than expected. It just misses out though being really innovative and can't quite break out of the mold of most of the other sci fi thrillers."", 'So I\'ve read a lot of people dissing the movie, and I don\'t find it that bad. Maybe the book was better. Boy, doesn\'t that happen enough? The cinematography is good, the effects are good, the clichés are there. But if I leave it at that, you\'d think ""why did this guy give it 8/10""? Well, because I was entertained, I was left wondering, it could\'ve been better like 99.9% of all movies ever made, but it also could\'ve been a LOT WORSE.I studied - majored - in Cinematography, and I can appreciate the hard work that goes into a movie. Even if it\'s a bad movie. I stand and leave theaters when it goes bad, and I wouldn\'t have done it here.

We will put them inside the maze and study their brain activities under certain scenarios from a distance.L: Are you kidding? Why don\'t we study it in a lab, where we have superior equipment?PM: Right. Maybe we can read their brain activities with micro-transmitter implants. They can do voodoo magic I don\'t have to explain.L: But why should we severely limit our technology? Well... fine. What kind of a maze?PM: Enormous, at least a couple kilometers wide, with 100 ft high walls. And it will reconfigure itself periodically.L: Reconfigure? 100ft?PM: Yes, we will build tons of moving massive stone walls, put gigantic hydraulics, motors and generators. Energy needs and maintenance should be negligible.L: *sigh* Where shall we build it?PM: In the middle of desert sir, where the working temperatures are infernal, roads and rails are blocked, and transportation costs are high.L: Not underground?PM: Of course not, because we will need a lush forest inside the maze.L: How will that work?PM: We will plant some trees and hope it will rain enough to keep the green.L: And what workforce would build it? We have enough problems with decreasing population already.PM: We will use as many survivor people as we can to get it done as quickly as possible.L: Then what? Who will we put in there?PM: Teenagers.L: Why? Do they have some significance older people don\'t have? Why not 20 or 25 years old people?PM: I\'ll come back to you on that sir, but I feel like we should put teenagers in there...

Then what?PM: We will open and close the maze every day and release giant, genetically modified spider-scorpion creatures every night to kill any escapees. They\'ll be injected with the virus.L: Sacrificing some of the last of survivors of humanity we study and invest lots of time in would be acceptable. And we might ignore the danger of uncontrolled spreading of the virus I guess. So, do we have them creatures in stock?PM: No sir. We have to develop the technology first and breed them as well.L: I see. And that\'s the only way to study these teenagers? What about their hormones?

Why shall we halve the ""guinea pigs"" we have?PM: You haven\'t heard the best part yet. We\'ll put the girls in the second maze.L: What second maze?PM: We\'ll build another maze just like this one, just as expensive and elaborate, and put the girls there.L: And how long will we keep them there?PM: As long as it takes until they escape. Years, decades if necessary.L: What if they decide not to escape or those monsters kill them?PM: Sometimes science needs sacrifices sir. And if they decide to stay, we\'ll help them escape after a while.L: Then why do we have to wait for years?

Let\'s start.Had they not tried to explain the premise, it would be much much better for the sake of the movie.', 'This movie when not compared to James Dashners book is wonderful. The cinematography is wonderful, the script is great, and the acting is even better. I admit I might be biased on the acting part my favorite actor stars in this movie. Here are the reasons its not good.Alby shows Thomas around the first day. The screen writer gave Alby all of Chucks dialog from the book. Theresa doesn\'t go into a coma. Ben isn\'t in ""the changing"" when Thomas comes to the Glade. there is no cliff. the ""keeper\'s meeting"" isn\'t private. Gally doesn\'t get mad at the meeting and leave the Glade. In the maze Thomas has Minho\'s help getting Alby up on the maze wall. it rains. Theresa brings the serum with her. Thomas and Theresa don\'t communicate telepathically. The Griever attack is all wrong. Gally doesn\'t give himself to the grievers. there are numbers as a password. the scientists are dead when the ""Gladers"" arrive. Gally doesn\'t want to leave. Gally kills chuck without being controlled. the maze is not underground. For those reasons I give this a rating of seven. it follows the book but leaves out things that are important. Not all of the things I put are important to the movie. but I felt were.', ""Although The Maze Runner story isn't one of the brilliants I have seen, it is interesting enough to satisfy my interest. Opening scene is intriguing and wakes your interest to wait to see what to come. Story itself is many times seen in various movies, but citation to such movies as Cube and TV- shows like Lost keeps you interest awake about what to come. Biggest problem is the movie casting. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is interesting character enough, but Will Boultier as villain of story is too lame personality. And somehow I don't understand the meaning of Teresa's (Kaya Scolecario) character who seem to pointless for the whole story. Maybe her role for the story grows and clears at the forthcoming movies. Sequel is coming next fall. After all great scenery combined with intensive storytelling is fresh enough to bring this movie a little bit more interesting, than most of those Hollywood's post-apocalyptic serial productions these days. I stay wait sequel with great interest."", ""Wow, I really anticipated on this movie, suspense, action, the unknown, it all sounds very exciting. Now I must say that I have seen some very good movies and series round this theme that may influence my judgment, for example The Cube (1 - 3), Persons Unknown, Saw, etc. all have a person or group of persons who don't know how they get there or how to get away. How is it possible that those movies, some dating from 1997, are so much better then a 2014 movie? And being almost 2 hours long, how come so little happens in those 2 hours? Some reviewers already mentioned the contradictory and illogical elements in this movie, and yes, this does this movie, with such much potential, not much good, it's just annoying to see them not try what is so logic. The movie is entertaining, but leaves you very unsatisfied."", ""The previews for this movie interested me and after seeing that it was from another book series, I decided to read all of them, particularly the first one. It was gripping and kept me hooked. So, when the film finally came out last month, I was expecting this film to live up to my expectations and to my surprise, it turned out to be an intense and well-acted film. It isn't one of the best book-to-film adaptations like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Hunger Games, but considering that it avoided the tired trend of young-adult romance movies, this is one of the better films of the year.The story, for the most part, is interesting and kept the spirit and tone of the book intact while keeping some of the minimal changes which were acceptable. It also has some smart dialog and explains the details of how the people are trapped in a maze and their attempts to find a way out very well. The pacing is mostly decent and gives its time to develop not only the main protagonist, but the other characters as well. The music score is pretty good and it fitted the tone of the film perfectly";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"[""I have to say that the producers would have to be stupid not to use Burger again as the director. He did such a great job with this one. I thought I was going to see a film that was mostly aimed at teens. However the story alone makes this far superior to most teen oriented films. In fact this didn't feel much like a teen film at all. The fantasy story is a great metaphor for our current society, it's simply a very relevant film. The directing here was spot on. The story as fun as it is, does have a few holes, sure, but they are easy to look over because they are such small holes. The film simply works as a commentary piece on political philosophy, and as an entertaining action film laced with some romantic tension. In my view this film was far, far superior to the very teen oriented and very one dimensional Hunger Games, and it's certainly more unique as well. Woodley is impressive here, clearly showing the ability to play a very layered and complex character.8/10"", ""Divergent was indeed made to capitalize on the popularity of the Hunger Games book & film series by author Suzanne Collin. Some people might say, it's a total rip-off, but in my opinion, author Veronica Roth was influence by the books and inspiration to make her own. It's no differ, than Suzanne Collins taking elements from previous novels like George Orwell's 1984 and Koushun Takami's Battle Royale. For people to say, Divergent is a total rip-off of Hunger Games is an understatement. If anything, the movie is more influence by novel works like Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Dart, Orson Scott Card's Ender Games, and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter. Even the movie takes bit of its story from films like 2010's Inception by Christopher Nolan & Mark Water's 2004's Mean Girls. Other influences come from the Meyers-Briggs personality tests, Milgram experiment, and attitude toward divergent thinking (ATDT). This is a Psychology major fan film. With all this influences, Divergent create its own identify. The movie starts out in a futuristic dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). Members join a faction based on their preference but are initially given a suggestion by an aptitude test. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) has grown up in Abnegation, the faction that runs the government, yet has always been fascinated by Dauntless. Every year, 16-year-olds undergo a serum-based aptitude test that indicates the faction into which they would best fit, but something went wrong, with Beatrice's test";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Its chief failing not the age of its key players but the fact they seem to be forever apologising, for the fact.There are men and women in their 50\'s in the force, so why all the lame jokes about grey hair, sagging physiques and more?Plus the need to drag on board secondary characters, apparently to carry the action side of this flick cause the lead characters are ""sooooo over the hill""? The result is a film that feels messy, that\'s only occasionally funny and has no central focus.What a shame. 5/10.', ""A fitting end to the trilogy. It's funny and Entertaining"", 'Bad Boys for Life is definitely better than you would expect. Returning to screens 17 years after Bad Boys II, Smith and Lawrence are still a terrific pairing with great comedic chemistry.

Maybe some parts of them do match to their personality, who knows? Having said that, the movie is quite predictable, but also quite fun overall. I cannot be mad at some of the flaws and the convinient timing of certain events. Nor the added relationships and backstories that might feel detached to a degree. If you can just watch it, without thinking too much, it'll be ok. But I reckon it is time to rewatch the first two movies again ... (4 Life though?

It is not light-hearted, albeit there is some slick dialogues. It has no comic appeal, albeit there is a bit of dry humor. Think of shortened edition of Michel Mann\'s ""Heat"" rather than ""Snatch"" or ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"", and you\'ll got some understanding of what it\'s all about.Jason Statham is perfectly fitting for the role of mysterious H., a character with dark past and blurred present. Again, it\'s not Statham typical B-movie action performance, since here thriller for the most part prevails over action. It\'s not entirely original work: Ritchie\'s film based on French Le Convoyeur (2004), but it\'s more of re-imagning than a direct copy or a straitforward remake.Starts like action-comedy, but then getting more and more dark, as new elements of the story introduced. At some moments plot is a bit hard to follow due to non-linear structure, but the basic points are always intact. Some subplots seems lost by the third act, and its preventing film from being great. However, for the most part it\'s a very soild, if unusual, effort from Ritchie entetring to a more mature ground. In the end, it\'s a suspenseful heist movie involving betrayal, family tragedy and a huge, long, mercialess gunfight in the final act.', 'Always the cool tough guy that noone can beat.Full of suspense, gripping the entire time, intense, two stories in parallel that come together, somewhat predictable betrayals and twist, felt a bit dark at times, satisfying ending, not a huge amount of action but a solid storyline that keeps you on edge.Watch it on the big screen with a good sound system for greater intensity.', ""In L. A., an armored truck is robbed and the two drivers are killed. Patrick Hill (Jason Statham) barely passes the tests to be the new hire at the company. When his truck gets hit, he turns into the Terminator.This is a Guy Ritchie film. It's a mid-level action thriller. It mostly works although it insists on following the story from all sides which leaves the film at almost two hours. By grouping the different sides separately, they do feel a bit split especially the story of the robbers. I do wonder if the search for the inside man would be a more compelling path. Ritchie is trying for a tighter thriller than his usual. It's him slimmed down. He uses his action skills but this is not going to be considered one of his best or most inventive."", 'I am surprised of some reviews that are saying about frustration from this movie. What did you expect from the Ritchie\'s film with Statham in 2021? Sophisticated drama with Oscar winning plot?In fact I got from ""Wrath of Man"" exactly what I expected - charismatic and not very complicated action movie of a good quality. The only surprising moment for me is a gloomy atmosphere of the whole story. But Jason 100% fits this dark drama.', ""Glad to see a movie that isn't constantly rubbing some sort of political garbage in your face every two minutes! This movie proves you can successfully have a diverse cast that doesn't seem forced. The dialogue is a little contrived at times, which took me out of it, but for a couple hours of shoot em up fun with a semi-clever story (and Statham is pretty bad ass) it's worth the price of admission."", 'Good movie. Some reviews say the story is predictable but I disagree.', ""I'm a big fan of Jason Statham but this movie wasn't one of his best. Well acted but the plot had a few holes in it. Such as why the underused Andy Garcia Fed character stood by and let Jason kill loads of bad guys. Such as how Jason, after being shot down in the depot shootout, was mostly uninjured in the final scene."", ""This is not your traditional Guy Ritchie movie with slick fast paced action, clever humour and lots of twists. Which I have loved in the past. It is basically a combination of heist movie and revenge thriller. But it's played very straight, without a lot of effort to build characters, and doesn't ever seem to build much momentum. So a few times during the movie I found myself looking at my watch, wondering if it was really going anywhere.The action is fairly tight but mainly gunplay, not much physical action as Statham is famous for.There are no heroes either, Stathams character seems to be a pretty nasty piece of work himself.All in all, it's an average thriller with nothing in particular to recommend it."", ""Wrath of Man is an engaging action-thriller from start to finish, though lacking in memorable characters and moments.Statham's good, but his character gets shot up twice and keeps going like some terminator..."", 'Guy Ritchie gives us something fun and gripping with a plot that flows well while having its own original taste. Heist movies seem to be very similar to one another, but this take is a bit more fresh than the rest. It gives depth to both the protagonist and the antagonist which I think is a great mind game that a writer/director can play on the audience. My favorite part of the film is the darker toned score that plays behind a large majority of the scenes, adding a great amount of suspense. I know its a difficult thing to accomplish these days, but I would have given a higher score if it had a more of an original ending. Overall, its a great film that will keep you interested throughout its runtime.', 'A lot is giving away in the trailers for this movie that spoil surprises. I am a big Jeffrey Donovan fan and this is the best performance I\'ve seen Scott Eastwood have. Josh Hartnett is underutilized unfortunately.

Hopefully."", ""I already have watched the documentary which was a real eye opener. Admittedly the film covers how Robert Freegard was tracked down one of his victims. The acting by Gemma was a bit wooden and I know she's better than this performance. The film lacked atmosphere so I am assuming it didn't have a big budget.The ending was completely different from the real life ending which took place in an airport.Overall it could have been a lot better with a bigger budget."", 'Fascinating movie with top cast. Very engrossing and emotive given the way likeable characters are manipulated and subject to disturbing treatment at the hands of a psychopath.This is very topical given nudge and psychological techniques were openly used on the population recently. The ethics of this need to be closely examined and this movie helps shed light on what is possible when trust is given to a third party who abuses for their own purpose.High recommended. 7/10.', ""I went in to this with low expectations, for no other reason than struggling to find something that looked decent to while away a Friday night.How pleasantly surprised I was with the way it turned out. The story is engaging and difficult to watch in equal measure. Norton is brilliant as the protagonist, while Arterton is believable as the victim who realises she's been had. Rather than thinking the other victims are just stupid for being sucked in, you realise how understandable it could be.Credit to the director. This is a worryingly realistic portrayal and kept me engaged for the 2 hour runtime."", 'The story is fascinating, and if interested one should watch"" ""Puppet Master"" on Netflix for a ""truer"" account from (some of) the horses mouths. Of course the 2 main characters have to be played by really good looking actors, which sets it apart from reality. The character Alice is a blend of several women and the ending is a fiction. At least ""Puppet Master"" gives you insight into the post prison continuation of the sociopath\'s trail of deception and cruelty.Yet it is entertaining enough, but it\'s failing is in not getting close to the minds of the victims. How do people get so bamboozled? Oh wait: Trump!', ""Going off the title, which of course is never wise, I heard agent and expected this to be some sort of action thriller. However, this was actually an interesting psychological thriller!! It was dull in parts but that is likely because I was expecting to be building up to cheap thrills and action. Instead, this was a very interesting mix of psychological profiles, how the human mind works, emotional manipulation and even a mirror on society in terms working life, student life, student debt and how the trajectory of our lives can impact our ultimate dreams and ambitions, and make us settle. This film is far from perfect and there are some parts I found unrealistic, so don't expect a classic, but it is an interesting watch."", ""Despite the negative reviews I thought I would give this a viewing. I'm glad I did as I enjoyed it. The first half hour or so was a bit slow but once the story gets going the film really drew me in to wanting to watch it to the conclusion. I thought the acting was excellent particularly by the two leading actors. The story is based on a true life event and I think there is a lesson here for everybody, be careful who you trust!"", ""This is a interestimg story reasonably well told but loses much of its credibility as a true story due to the director's obrsdion with including the Gemma Atherton character in more or less every single scene. Don't want to resort to spoiler but let's just say that it is farcical that she is heavily involved in the last 30 minutes of the film. Legally this could never happen. By then there are plot holes you could drive a bus through. Norton is good and Atherton is okay but the director is dire. Pity. Could have been great in different hands."", ""Clearly I was expecting a different watch based on the title, but was pleasantly surprised when the story started unravelling. Newb filmmakers Adam Patterson and Declan Lawn co-wrote and co-directed, and aside from slow pacing (especially the first half), they put together a nice suspenseful film. The last half got crazy tense and wow, what an intense true story this was. James Norton and Gemma Arterton played their roles great. Had the pacing been a little faster and/or the 115 min runtime trimmed down to around 95 mins, this film would've been near perfect. If anything, just watch it for the mind-boggling story from true events."", 'Surprising true story of Robert Freegard (James Norton), a con man who persuades his victims he an MI5 spy, recruiting them and then getting them to commit funds to help avoid being exposed and even killed, usually by the IRA. The focus is upon his latest target, solicitor, Gemma Arterton and how she sets out to get him.Interesting enough thriller, once again showing what a terrific actor Norton is, who can jump with great ease from deeply charming to deeply unpleasant. Arterton does well as the woman who falls head over heels in love with him and then has to overcome that to get her revenge. It has its moments but comes across more as a Sunday night tv thriller and really only comes truly alive when Norton is in it. Worth a look, but not exactly ground breaking.', 'I have rarely seen a movie, where in the beginning, the words and the behaviour of actors were so authentic.I did not know about the sensitive topic, and later on, everything appeared to me, spot on, understandable. The writers and directors did a great job.We would all have become a victim, had he chosen us.I know because I start looking the movie without knowing what it was about. In the beginning, it was just a very beautiful love story, no doubts.Gemma Atherton and James Norton were brilliant, but after the wakeup, Gemma was a little less convincing, and the movie lost of its witty style.The police investigation was much more ordinary, the last part of the movie lost itself in an entertaining thriller, but James Norton remained the perfect narcissistic pervert until the end.', 'One of those true story accounts that stupidly messes with facts and adds a few silly scenes (mostly towards end) that are mis-judged and a bit naff.

Had I realised there was also a docuseries, I'd likely have watched that first, though I'm not sure one would adversely impact on the otherThis movie works well at covering a long period of deceit, manipulation and fraud, though I feel it would have been better if more emphasis was placed on exploring the psychology behind Freegard's actions. Maybe the docuseries manages thatAn enjoyable watch, that builds through the first half, and unfolds with tension and pace in the second."", ""Most of the reviews are very negative about this film . Don't see why\nI was hooked from the first , the fact this is based on truth and after seeing it I can faintly remember it .The story here is far worse than anyone could ever imagine and that the conman could be so unscrupulous.I felt the story kept you watching from the first minute hoping for a good end .

Started off as what could possibly be a quite interesting story but 15 minutes in and you realise it's one of the worst bits of cinematography out their - even for Netflix!"", ""Rogue Agent loosely tells the true story of conman Robert Freegard, who doesn't stop targeting women, introducing himself to them sooner or later as a government agent, manipulating them, taking them on a rollercoaster ride in order to find ways to extort money from them or take advantage of them.The movie focuses on Robert's move towards Alice, a lawyer, who, finally convinced of his deceit, goes on a hunt to find him and bring him to justice, while Freegard had already made his move on a young girl, and later a woman.The movie generally succeeds in bringing the spectator into the atmosphere of mystery, uncertainty and deception. The two main actors play a big part in that. I wouldn't be surprised if James Norton is chosen as the next James Bond. The part he plays here could be the closest thing to a real secret agent. Gemma Arterton is also passionate, although her character's naivety is somewhat pushed, as Robert's ability in convincing his victims don't really show.His magnetism and way of playing with his victims' mind are more apparent though.Shows that often time, immediate reactions can overcome logic.Overall, it is a good movie to watch. Not a forgettable one at all.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Barry, D.W.

It is disguised simply as a film about an apparent nut who goes out and tries to right the wrongs that have been done to him and in his trek across Los Angeles he becomes an anti-hero. While that may be true to an extent, read more into it and you can see a film that tries to show us that there is something terribly wrong with how we live. I wasn\'t alive in the 50\'s, in fact, I was born in the 70\'s. So I can\'t honestly tell you if life was easier back then. But what I can tell you is that times were a bit more simple then. For the most part, you had one income in the household. You had T.V and radio as your entertainment and kids went outside to play. Now you must have both parents working so you can have that double income. Kids are obsessed with the internet and videogames and so on. What does all of this have to with the film? Everything!Falling Down is about the decay in one man\'s life and how it affects not only him but those around him. There is one very powerful scene in the film that can sum up everything.There is a key moment in Falling Down that is sad in it\'s reality, but true in it\'s opinion. Douglas is in a surplus store and the guy running it is a Nazi sympathizer. When Douglass doesn\'t share his opinions, they get into a confrontation. The guy snaps and tells Douglas to spread against the wall. He obliges and then the Nazi guy wants to handcuff him. He tells Douglas to give him his hand, he does. Then he tells Douglas to give him his other hand. Douglas is supporting himself on the wall in a 30 degree angle and if he gives the guy his other hand "" he\'ll fall down. "" Which is precisely what he tells the Nazi guy. This is a microcosm of the film and a microcosm of what may be wrong with not only society but people in general. There is a theory in wrestling that your arms and legs are like a table, if you take out any two of the legs or arms, your opponent falls down and is vulnerable. Same thing with a human being. Take away so many of his limbs ( job, wife, dignity, credit rating, kids, etc. ) and it may be only a matter of time before that person does snap. This movie shows us what happens to one individual that does snap. He wasn\'t all that bad to begin with, but as time went on and he was "" lied "" to, he can\'t handle it and finally one day, he has had enough. I think this film is more important than people realize and if you have only seen it once, see it again. You may see something that you didn\'t see before. Hats off to Schumacher and Douglas who had the guts to make this film.', 'The older you get, the more you will make sense and understand this movie', ""I declare this one of the most underrated movies ever made. What a great story. Just look at the situations in the movie. Did people not understand this movie? I think because of the way the movie was shot people look at it like a B movie but if you really think about it, it's far from that. There are so many parts that are just purely classic. You can relate to so many things in this movie. That's what the movie was trying to do. It was suppose to show you this little story about this average guy who goes off of the deep end... but then you look closer and you realize how many things you can truly relate to. How many things subconsciously frustrate you and how you never do anything about it. It shows how life is a double edged sword for some people, showing you that if you take matters into your own hands it comes back to you in the end and if you play by the rules you get screwed over. If you were to ask me what I thought about this film after I first saw it I would say that the movie was a cult classic. But sadly it's an underrated forgotten movie. I love this film. I give it 10 stars. If I could give it 11 I would. A movie that will be forever misunderstood."", 'Many people have said many nasty things about Joel Schumacher for what he did to Batman on the big screen. Every single one of them has been entirely deserved. But those insults should be softened with just a little praise for making a bold urban nightmare like this film.Falling Down is the story of a man who is stuck in traffic one day when his tolerance for the world is finally used up. Identified only by his license plate ""D-Fens"", the man (Michael Douglas) abandons his car and starts walking. He says he\'s going home, but where he\'s going isn\'t his home anymore. His ex-wife Beth and daughter Adele (Barbara Hershey and Joey Hope Singer) now live there and Beth has a restraining order against D-Fens. As he walks his way across Los Angeles, D-Fens has a series of violent encounters, first with the everyday aggravations of life in the big city. From busting up the shop of a immigrant merchant who speaks broken English to confronting some gang bangers to a gun point rant against the unctuous martinets at a fast food restaurant, D-Fens eventually graduates to more brutal acts against more existential frustrations like neo-Nazi gun nuts, pointless road construction and the vicious sense of entitlement among the wealthy. All the while, getting every closer to Beth and Adele.As reports of D-Fens\' slow moving rampage come in, the only one to figure out what\'s going on is a cop spending his last day on the job. Detective Prendergast (Robert Duvall) is retiring early, an taking a reduced pension, to satisfy the demands of his insecure, needy and somewhat unstable wife. Aided by the only cop he\'s friends with (Rachel Ticotin), Prendergast sets out to stop D-Fens before this day turns out to be the last day in the life of a lot of people.Falling Down is a smart film that takes on two cultural phenomena of the early 1990s. One is the concept of ""going postal"", where relatively normal men started going into their workplaces and shooting people. The other is the sense of economic disenfranchisement that came out of the recession that bridges the first Bush and Clinton Administrations. Now granted, as befitting a Joel Schumacher picture, this movie doesn\'t take those subjects on with any subtlety. But it does address them thoroughly with both empathy and honesty.Schumacher, Michael Douglas and screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith combine to make D-Fens a character who defies easy definition. He\'s neither the righteous vigilante of right wing fantasies nor a liberal\'s easily dismissed symbol of white male intolerance. He\'s a man who can legitimately claim he\'s been victimized by society, yet he\'s also a man whose seething rage terrifies the ones closest to him. Most of the carnage he creates is accidental or without malice, yet his ultimate goal is the darkest sort of evil. D-Fens is someone you cannot completely embrace or reject. You can only wonder how much of yourself is reflected in him.The whole film is somewhat like that. Most of the characters, even minor ones, are given depth and personalities like they\'re real human beings and not just constructs serving the script. They experience genuine humor and friendship and anguish and fear in a way this sort of high-concept movie usually doesn\'t provide.The contrast between D-Fens and Prendergast that runs through the story is a great example of that kind of complexity. They\'re both guys whose lives aren\'t working out like they wanted. One has a failed marriage and a lost career, the other a dead daughter and a crazy wife he feels responsible for. The ways they deal with those challenges are quite different. D-Fens is an idealist who cares about the way he thinks things should be, at the expense of the other people in the world with him. Prendergast is a pragmatist who takes the world as it is and does what he has to do to get by, without even thinking it could be any other way.I suspect that Falling Down has not gotten the acclaim it deserves because it\'s a mainstream work of entertainment that won\'t fit neatly into a particular box. It looks and sounds like a white male power trip, but it feels much more introspective and melancholy and despairing. I find it to be a compelling story with some great acting and I think you should give it a look.', ""This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Never, ever, has a movie been supported by one actor so well. Michael Douglas is perfect in this movie. It couldn't get any better. Every twitch he makes is perfection. That is not to say that the supporting cast is not good. They're great, Robert Duvall especially, but this is Douglas's movie. This is his role of a life-time. SPOILER: The plot is ridiculously simple: A man get's fed up with life, and he goes his own way, all the way to his ex-wife's and his daughter's birthday party. Complications occur, since the life of Douglas does not fit the niche of today's society.Douglas character is so cool, and his lines are great. He does everything we all want to do at some point in life. Although he seems psychotic and brutal, we still root for him and hope he will succeed in his quest.This movie is not for the queasy. It's brutal, it's honest, and it's not your conventional movie. Joel Shumacher should continue on these lines. 10/10"", 'Joel Schumacher\'s best film is a brilliantly realized urban nightmare that many people in the audience will identify with. On one of those typical LA dog-days, disgruntled motorist Michael Douglas, caught in what could be the traffic jam from hell, finally decides he can\'t take it any more, abandons his car on the freeway and decides to walk home and God help anyone who gets in his way.I suppose ""Falling Down"" could best be described as a road movie in reverse. The car has been ditched and the journey is on foot. Perhaps the film\'s closest antecedent is ""The Swimmer"" in which a similarly deranged Burt Lancaster decides to \'swim\' home through the pools of his neighbours. As the dangerously unstable D-Fens, (he is known by his car registration), Michael Douglas gives the performance of his career and Schumacher racks up the tension to breaking point and beyond.', ""I think Joel Schumacher is a really terrible filmmaker. Nearly every one of his films is an exercise in flashy stylistics with not a single thing to say. Look no further than his Batman films. But on one occasion, he managed to rise above his desire for eye-candy overkill. And produce something really worthwhile. And Falling Down was that film.Falling Down would have to be the best film out of Schumacher's mostly awful body of work. Its the one thing he's ever done where he actually forgets about battering an audience into submission with glorious light effects and pretty costumes and sets. He's produced a violent story to be sure. But a curiously humane one too. And Michael Douglas is its human centre.Douglas plays Bill Foster, a defence worker of seven years who gets laid off. He spends the next month and a half trying to make sense of the tattered shreds of his life. He's a man with no job. No wife and daughter because they've cut him out of their lives. And most importantly, he's a man without purpose.But on one particularly hot day in LA, he finds a purpose. The opening scene is filled with glaringly aggressive closeups of Douglas' face. Sweating and twitching. All while he's sitting in his car in the middle of an agonisingly slow traffic jam. You know something is coming. Something is about to erupt. And that thing is Bill. In a split-second he snaps, abandons his car and tells the baffled motorist behind him he's going home.Although Bill is indeed going home to his wife and daughter, he makes a few stops along the way. Bill has become so disillusioned by society's flaws and shortcomings, he feels a need to rectify it by lashing out at the mundane trappings of our everyday lives. With his crew-cut, white shirt and tie, briefcase in one hand and automatic weapon in the other, its Ordinary Joe meets GI Joe.Its hard to believe Falling Down came from the same director of mindless trash like Batman & Robin. This is an acutely observed portrait of the sorry state of our affairs. And Michael Douglas turns in a real showstopper of an acting performance. Its a style of acting brimming with raw honesty. He plays a man not at the mercy of madness, but someone who's grown accustomed to it. This is the film Michael Douglas should have won an Oscar for.The film is bold enough to portray Bill as an object of sympathy, even when he's committing shocking acts of violence. Bill is a middle aged man, who felt he was in control all of his life, and when everything that mattered to him fell to dust, it left him a broken man. His new mission gives him something to focus on, but I sense its not quite the liberating experience Bill envisioned it would be. Even when he tries to reassert control, his inherent emptiness still plagues him. What a brave, plaintively truthful performance!Falling Down has received a fair amount of criticism, especially from racial minorities, who have lambasted the film because Bill's targets appear to be Korean shopkeepers or Latino street gangs. It is easy to view it in that context. That Bill is nothing more than a walking megaphone venting his hatred towards foreigners. But that's too narrow a vision. Schumacher's direction is really more expansive then you realise.Yes he does trash the Korean's store, because he overcharges for a can of Coke, and Bill won't have enough change left over for the payphone. And yes he beats up Latino thugs. But these are just the bystanders along the way of Bill's inexorable journey. I don't think there's any intentional malice intended there.And Schumacher's direction is quite excellent. He stages self-contained vignettes that are tiny microcosms of what exactly is wrong with this world. Like the scene at the fast-food restaurant. A classic example of the bureaucratic red tape that deliberately sets out to entangle people like poor Bill. Who hasn't felt like standing up for they're rights as a consumer? Bill can't have breakfast because he's a few minutes late. These are the type of absurdities Bill is campaigning against.Falling Down works like a steadily unfolding carpet. And as Bill walks through the city of LA, he is wearing out the hollow material that its weaved from. There is a very natural flow to the film. Things fall into place quite beautifully. Such as when Bill makes the decision to carry a bag full of weapons instead of his normal briefcase. This is a man going through a steady metamorphosis from which there is no return.Some people have felt disappointed by the somewhat low-key ending. But I felt it couldn't have ended any other way. Its an ending of weary resignation. No matter how much Bill has tried to add meaning to his rootless existence, the truth is society may have to live with its flaws. No matter what Bill's efforts.One of the most daring films of the 90s, and any film that attempts to address society's failings with such frank honesty deserves strong commendation indeed."", ""This probably will not everybody's cup of tea, but if you're having a bad day it will be difficult not to relate to D Fens (Douglas). It's probably not an accident that there's quite a few similarities in the lives of D Fens and retiring police officer Prendergast (Duvall). As with most good films it also makes you think a bit. At what point does D Fens cross the line ? I'd suggest the Whammy Burger joint, but he does have a point with his flat burger and 2 minutes late for breakfast. The point of no return is a truly sinister scene."", ""Is it just me or is this truly one of the best pictures from the last decade? Michael Douglas delivers an astonishing performance as D-Fens (William Foster) an ordinary guy, who has an obviously perfect job at the department of Defense, until he gets fired and his wife breaks up with him. The following opening credits are, according to my view, some of the best in motion picture history : the whole scene is just so extremely claustrophobic. D - Fens is just ''a victim of the modern age'' just like the writer's wife in A Clockwork Orange (another classic) who cannot stand the normal routine of living anymore, and begins a trial of violence in the asphalt Jungle called Los Angeles."", 'Above-average tale of a defense plant engineer (Michael Douglas) who loses everything -- his job, his car, his dignity, his temper, his wife, his daughter, his life.

(Like that in the John Cheever short story, ""The Swimmer,"" it\'s a fantasy.) As he trudges along in his white shirt, tie, and unhip eyeglasses, he pauses from time to time to phone his wife and tell her he\'s on his way, because it\'s his daughter\'s birthday.""I know it\'s Adel\'s birthday -- what do you want?"", she tells him, adding, ""I\'ll call the police if I have to."" Meanwhile, Douglas runs into all kinds of obstacles. A street-wise Korean shopkeeper wants to charge him eighty-five cents for a can of Coke (a big laugh, as of this date) and Douglas blows his cork, smashing some merchandise and walking off with the owner\'s sawed-off baseball bat.Things get worse. He crosses paths with some cholos who demand his money and produce a weapon that, when I was a teenager, was widely known as a ""Portugese"" knife. But he clobbers them with his bat and, later, winds up with a gym bag full of their pistols and automatic weapons. Douglas may be a fruitcake but everyone else is mean too. The confrontations continue and the police, represented by Robert Duvall and Rachel Ticotin, finally get wise to him and track him to the Santa Monica pier where he is more or less holding his wife and child hostage. When Duvall tries to place him under arrest, Douglas asks wonderingly, ""I\'m the bad guy?"" Whatever other things he\'s lost, self-justification isn\'t one of them.From what I\'d heard, I hadn\'t expected much of this film -- another revenge story, along the lines of ""Death Wish"". But it\'s actually fairly complex, despite some clumsy moment and many implausibilities. The film\'s chief weakness is that, though Douglas is clearly around the bend, everybody who gets a taste of his anger somehow has asked for it. The offense can be major -- trying to gun him down on the street -- or minor -- refusing to serve him from the breakfast menu at a burger joint after eleven thirty.And I don\'t know if the writer, Ebbe Rowe Smith, intended it this way but both Douglas\'s ex-wife and Duvall\'s current wife, played by Tuesday Weld, are both bitches in their different ways. When Douglas has called to say he\'s on his way home, despite the restraining order, Hershey calls the police and informs them that he has ""a tendency towards violence."" (He pounded on the door after midnight.) The police ask her if he struck his daughter. No. ""Did he -- strike you?"" ""Not exactly. I didn\'t want to wait until he got around to it. He COULD -- I think."" The cop nods knowingly and makes a note. Abusive husband. That\'s a cheap, stereotypical shot. Douglas has a restraining order against him because he\'s suspected of perhaps some day possibly committing a violent act within his family. Kind of a unilateral preemptive move on Hershey\'s part.Duvall\'s wife, Tuesday Weld, is also a thoroughly formulaic figure -- whining, narcissistic, demanding, hypochondriacal, the clear wearer of the pants in the family. Wardrobe and make up have turned her into an ill-groomed slob, but it would have been truer to the character (Duvall: ""She lost her beauty."") if she had done her desperate best to look good. The two wives may be manipulative but Duvall\'s partner, Rachel Ticotin, comes off as an admirable figure. Not dazzlingly gorgeous, she nevertheless has good, strong features arranged in an uncontrived manner. And she gives a good performance. So does Lois Smith in the small part of Douglas\' uncomprehending mother. Some of the bit parts are so poorly done, they\'re an embarrassment to watch. Douglas himself can\'t be considered a wildly expressive performer but he successfully suggests the kind of pressure one might find behind a zit that\'s about to pop. Robert Duvall has given some magisterial performances early in his career -- M*A*S*H and The Godfather among them -- but here rather walks through the part with a lot of pointless or possibly ironic chuckles.Weaknesses aside, Douglas\'s character is complicated enough to grip us and the milieu of Los Angeles is captured in all its local color, which varies from indifference to outrage.', ""Joel Schumacher's career has gone down the drain since this movie, for now he is just trying to make stupid movies with no sense and style. However this proved to be one of his best films. Michael Douglas portrayed William Forster perfectly, giving us a character who is both sensible and psychotic at the same time. The whole scene with Douglas in the fast food restaurant was priceless, giving a voice to the typical angry consumer. So many messages in the film really brought out the stereotypical infuriated American, and gave us the reactionary nature of such an individual. While this film will most likely leak in to the annals of obscurity, this one will always remain in my video collection."", ""Whilst enjoyable, I certainly wouldn't call it a masterpiece of cinema. Yes Michael Douglas is very good indeed, but others aren't so good, and it's a film where for me, all the best bits happen in the first half, and then the second half gets slightly ridiculous and drags a little. One of those films where if you've seen it once, you've seen it, the storyline isn't that complex to need to watch it again, there are no sub plots to miss."", ""This was one of the best movies in the 90's that all of us stress takers can relate to. He represented us who put up with people's crap all day long and people who spit and walk over his face not being afraid of who he is. Douglas has proved to the world that even the most quiet fellows can be dangerous. I love this movie every step of the way. After watching this movie it seemed as if Duvall and the others were the bad guys and Douglas was the good guy."", ""This is one of those movies where you are rooting for the bad guy and they are acting so crazy that you enjoy it. I thought the plot was decent and it definitely had some eventful moments, however at times it felt a bit dragged, especially with the scenes about the retiring officer which I didn't care much for. I liked the action scenes a lot and also the outbursts which were funny and made the movie more entertaining. I think this movie would be more criticised and be considered more offensive if it was released today. Overall this is a good movie, but I wish I could've seen more of the main character who was great and a bit less of the retiring officer.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was hilarious with a good story. I didn't really know what to expect when putting this on because I've never even heard of it, but I'm so glad I found it. Was just a solid film all round, I have absolutely zero complaints or anything negative to say about it."", 'My British/Irish humour puts me at variance with US comedy. This film was funny because of the subtlety and great acting. I rarely like films when a child tags along because often the child behaves with a pretence superior to the adults but in this film the young girl was outstanding and can be taken seriously and believable.\nThis is one easy to follow adventure with lots of funny bits. The story is not the star, the cast and the way they blend is well done. Rarely do you see a film when the whole cast are brilliant.', 'This was an ecstatics spectacle. Ryan Gosling just keeps falling off and tumbling and walking out unscathed in search of the truth. And the beautiful vibe of 1970s Los Angeles is brought it to perfection.', 'For a start i can\'t believe that I missed this film in the cinema and am I now regretting that decision considering how unbelievably good this film is. The main reason for me to take a look at this film months after it had been in cinemas is the two main leads, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Both of which are amazing actors and are just fantastic in there respective roles in the film, they play of one another in the film so well it really shows that both actors genuinely get on with each other. As for other actors they are all great however there is one who in my opinion rises above even Crowe and Gosling and that is the character of Holly March played by Angourie Rice. She is brilliant in every scene she is in whether it be insulting her father or giving advice for a con, this actress has great potential to go on a do great things. Turning our attention away from the cast and to the story and director, both roles which where filled by Shane Black. Once again this very talented director has hit it out of the park, the script is absolutely brilliant and there is never a dull moment in this film. Whether it be the banter between Holland and his daughter or to Jackson the lines that the actors deliver are amazing and perfectly timed, especially Hollands random quotes about Adolf Hitler. As well as the script that Shane Black helped to write the directing in this film is simply unique and brilliantly stylised, it probably really helped Black to write and direct this film. I would like to mention that ""people"" these days say Hollywood isn\'t making original films anymore and that only franchise films will be made. However a film like The Nice Guys is original and was made and unfortunately from what the box office results are know body bothered to go and see it, I know I\'m guilty of that as well. This really makes me sad and it is also sad for this film because it 100% deserves a sequel but will probably never get it. There are some films around that have conned their way to multiple sequels without any of them being any good...divergent..cough.....Finally I would like to say that this film in my opinion is the best of 2016 so far, this film is such a surprise you will not be disappointed if you see it.', 'I\'ll admit that I am unfamiliar with most of Shane Black\'s original works, watching The Nice Guys made me want to go back and take a look at his earlier films. The characters were well written, even better cast, and fit well with the theme of the film. There was rare a dull moment, it seemed I was either enjoying the dark comedic tone, or getting engaged in the plot. While the first two thirds of the film seemed excellent, the writers set themselves up for a fantastic finish, but were unable to capitalize on that potential. The script seemed to suddenly turn very basic, with things ""falling"" into place almost too miraculously to be true. I never felt like I had truly been given an ending worthy of a classic detective story, but the fast pace of the film and humor was enough to make it very enjoyable.', 'The Nice Guys is an absolutely fantastic film from beginning to end! Every scene in the movie has at least 3 jokes that will make you belly laugh, and the action is well shot and choreographed. Additionally, Angourie Rice is also great in this flick, as she puts on one of the best performances any child actor has. Did I mention how funny the jokes are? The villains are great as well, even if they are extremely intentionally cliché making them so much better! That aside, the film provides the audience with a genuinely well thought out and well executed mystery. All in all, is this film fantastic? Yes. Is it funny? Absolutely. Should you watch it? DEFINATLY.', ""The Nice Guys was a movie which showed great potential. Crowe and Gosling work well together even with a dire script. The plot was at best very mediocre and many of the gags were predictable. This was a terrible let down to the film. What also didn't help was that it wasn't the clearest in terms of story lines. I will never tire of watching Crowe beat someone up but alas a great movie it does not make! The main protagonist who was being sought was also dull and to be quite frank it was one of the better parts of the movie when she got shot. The Nice Guys also tries too hard and there are echoes of such great movies like Kick Ass and Boogie Nights, which are never really pulled off in this film. It's not the worst movie you'll ever see but in my opinion I wouldn't rush to see it again."", ""Nice Guys is a film you can enjoy but does not satisfy. Crowe & Gosling are really good in their roles but I felt we needed to know more about there characters and lives. The virtually alcoholic private investigator (Gosling) with a 13 yr old daughter. I was left puzzled : Why was he virtually alcoholic? Why did his house burn down? What happened to his wife? Why is he such a loser? You know even less about Crowes character. Which is a shame as they both worked well together and it makes it interesting being set in 1977One is searching for Amelia (Gosling)The other is paid by Amelia (Crowe) to stop people searching for her. The first half of the film is good. Why are people searching for Amelia, including some who intend to kill her. But for me, the second half of the film was ruined by a pretty stupid plot, which I will summarise as follows. Amelias mother (Basinger) is head of justice department. She (Basinger) is in cahoots with car manufacturers to cover up excessive pollution from their cars.Amelia outraged makes a 'porn film' that exposes all of this. She intends it to shown at the 1977 car expo to reveal all the dastardly dealings. Basinger is having everyone involved in the film killed, including her daughter Amelia and all copies of the film destroyed. I know it's pretty stupid. Which is a shame because Crowe and Gosling did such a good job. There are plenty of laughs, you start the film with high expectations, But 'Nice Guys' doesn't know if its a comedy, a thriller or a film with a serious message. So ends up a disappointing 6.5/10"", ""A movie-like thing masquerading as a period noir buddy cop comedy. I've read a number of reviews so far and one thing that almost everyone agrees on, even those who like the movie, is that the screenplay is a big hot mess. There is no momentum to the story, which is somehow both predictable and unfocused. As soon as Kim Bassinger's character shows up we know where this is all going but who cares anyway? The movie attempts to swerve towards the broadly comic and surreal but is not inspired enough to revel in its own fun and allow the audience to forgive the meandering and ultimately nonsensical plot for the window dressing that it is. The characters lack sharp definition and development. Gosling and Crowe give whatever glimmer of hope there is to this movie but the material is not worthy. They may have been miscast but its almost impossible to tell due to the writing. Their characters are not very likable, consistent or distinguishable from each other(important with odd couple dynamics). Supporting characters are not the fun colorful characters one would hope to have from such a movie. Gosling's daughter character is played by a talented young actress but unfortunately this is one of the worst elements of the movie. The child character who behaves like an adult is a cringe worthy staple of Hollywood and that is exactly what we get with in this movie. And why in a buddy cop movie are you focusing so much attention on buddy cop's 12 year old daughter? Why?? You could have a romantic interest or a fun villain but no, we get a third wheel Nancy Drew character.From the beginning the daughter character is forced into the plot like this is a four quadrant family friendly comedy and I inwardly groaned as I realized that I was going to have to live with this decision by the screenwriters. This film has a rather bizarre obsession with children and even weaves in inappropriate porn jokes and adult situations with children in ways that I found off- putting, and I love South Park and edgy humor involving kids so that's saying something. The movie is too scattershot and all over the place. Worst of all, its not very funny. There are maybe three moments in the movie that are chuckle worthy and they are featured in the trailer. The filmmaker has fun with the 1977 setting but this movie could have taken place in 2016 or 2026 or 2177, it doesn't matter."", ""But very good if you are into this kind of stuff. So this is not Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or Last Boy Scout, but it is a new movie by Shane Black, which is a reason to get excited about. If you like weird dialog and situations comedy that he seems to be able to write spot on, then you are in the right place.Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling hit the nails on their heads. Deadpan or outright funny, completely insane to just weird. One thing this is not: Predictable or tame. You only have to decide if this is your kind of movie. If your taste and the movies do either collide or are in the same ballpark. If the latter is the case, do watch it and you'll get something unique and really good. One of the Highlights of 2016 for sure"", 'I Really liked this movie,all the way up until shortly after the one hour mark. Than it just took a 180 turn for the worse,and ended up getting really really stupid.Which was quite annoying.In the beginning it was funny and charming and full of good quips back and forth, between the two leads.Some of the situations was a bit over the top,but you could live with em,cause the rest of the movie held up fine. But than comes the one hour mark,and things start going down hill. Up until now,Russel has been the smart one and Ryan was the dorky drunk guy. But than suddenly they both turn into dumb and dumber.And that just ruined it for me.After that I lost total interest in the movie.', 'FINALLY!!\nA comedy that tries to tell a story!\nAs a bonus, it gets told amazingly well.\nThe cast was also great, but I have to say that Angourie stole the show.\nI enjoyed watching it, a lot actually.', 'Throughout this film I couldn\'t shake the feeling that I had missed something. Watching it is like watching a long, long trailer with all the highlights, but with the explanatory scenes cut out. Shane Black, the director, seems to want to put on the screen his whole ""bag of tricks"" without making the effort to connect them in logical or emotional order. Watching the film becomes like thumbing through a catalog of Hollywood tropes. Black throws one thing after another on to the wall to see what sticks. (Catalog or spaghetti on the wall, which is it? That will give you an idea of how disjointed and jarring the narrative is.)The film presents some genuinely funny moments. The problem is that they are not prepared for or followed up. In one scene (in the trailer) the two dump a body over a fence. Big laugh! But so what? We have almost no idea about the people on whose table the body is dumped. Where do they fit into Black\'s word? Having a body land on your patio table is a very effective metaphor of the corrupt nature of L.A., but it\'s immediately abandoned. I felt left in the lurch.The director has declared that he wanted to convey, underneath the comedy, a more serious message about a corrupt world in which two knights in tarnished armor must make their way. So far, so good. The problem, again, is that he hasn\'t paid enough attention to establishing their backgrounds or to the development of their relationship. I felt constantly off balance and blind- sided.Which relationship is primary: the one between the two detectives, or the one between Gosling\'s character and his daughter? The film can\'t seem to make up its mind and doesn\'t define either very satisfactorily. I kept comparing this film to ""Paper Moon,"" and the latter won every time.The director also declared that the moral objective of these knights is to protect little girls (among whom, besides Gosling\'s daughter, are adult female characters like Misty Mountains and Amelia). This is sentimental and patronizing. If we have learned anything since the seventies, it is that (1) women demand the right to make on their own decisions, and (2 ) that little boys and men deserve protection, too.', ""'70s detective movie starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, directed by Kiss Kiss Bang Bang's Shane Black. It is a ton of fun. There's definitely something missing that I'm not quite able to put my finger on - it really feels like it should be an all-time classic, but ends up falling short. There's some weaknesses in the script, like Black isn't quite able to make his themes work entirely. It has so much great stuff in it, though. The two leads are ace, both giving near-career best performances. Angourie Rice is also excellent as Gosling's teenage daughter. They do fail to establish a great antagonist, though bad guys Matt Bomer, Keith David and Beau Knapp are all memorable. Others who will remain nameless aren't as good. The film is very funny, thankfully, with Crowe and Gosling bouncing off each other nicely. It is true most of the best bits were given away in the film's two trailers. If you haven't seen them, you might enjoy this even more than I did. I'd definitely recommend it either way."", ""Has some good raunchy moments definitely the best buddy comedy in a while. The 70's era adds a lot to the film. Gosling is spot on with his stupid but smart mentality and Crowe plays a great tough-guy asshole perfectly. He may have been born to play that role."", ""This movie has a Lolita complex. Really odd. Wanted to like this movie but turned it off about halfway. Enough is enough.From the adult film star who is roughly 15 or 16 years old, to the daughter who is probably 13 saying dirty things during the party scene, hell even to the 11 year old boy who talks dirty, this movie is really odd. The acting is fine, the script is standard Hollywood except for the placement of children throughout it. The opening scene is great and it pulls you in but the rest drags and you're left wondering wtf the writers were thinking. Where are all the parents watching stuff like this?"", ""It's a crying shame this movie didn't do better. This was an amazing movie filled with fashion, aesthetic, humor, a good plot, and good acting. I loved this movie. The ending could've been better. It felt mediocre compared to how great the rest of the movie was. I'll watch this one again, it's worth the second viewing. Gosling knocked it out of the park. Again, I think it's really too bad this didn't do better. It might've encouraged him to do more roles like this because he was really good at it. I hope he does something similar again anyway. Because this was really good.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I love Matthew Vaughn films or least most of them he's very good at his craft. Kevin Bacon is always great at villain roles along with the rest of the cast is so good. Part of me remembers seeing this in the theater that was fun especially then I had people to go with, in the last several years I mostly go by myself I hope that changes eventually either way X: First Class is exactly what you want it to be!"", ""Xmen: First Class is simply fantastic. Strong emotion and explosive action. The acting is top notch. Delivery from every actor is at it's best, more so from Mystique, Beast, Xavier and Magneto. The story is more character based than action, however the action sequences are still superb. Personally i'd have liked to of seen it being a 15 and have a more adult but it wasn't a big issue. Also some more background story from the bad super's would have been good but again this wasn't too much of an issue and would leave some nice room for upcoming xmen movies. I don't want to say too much but to break it down... Go see this film no matter what you are into. There is something for everyone. 9/10 easy"", 'The fairest things you can say about X-Men: First Class is that it is clearly at least the 3rd best X-film, it may be the best written movie that\'s ever credited 6 people for the story and screenplay and it is absolutely one of the best prequels that\'s ever been made. Those all sound like more backhanded compliments that I intend or this motion picture deserves, but they are the most accurate descriptions I can come up with.Set primarily in the early 1960s, the story concerns how Professor X (James McEvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) met and began their lifelong enmity over the place of mutants in human society. They\'re brought together by their pursuit of Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Magneto is after him for Shaw killing his mother and torturing him as a boy in a Nazi concentration camp. Professor X has allied himself with the CIA and is after Shaw to stop him from starting a nuclear war between the U.S. and the USSR, something Shaw thinks will destroy humanity and empower mutantkind. Each side assembles their own team, with shape-changing Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) among the good mutants and telepathic lingerie fan Emma Frost (January Jones) highlighting the bad guys.The Martin Luther King Jr. vs Malcolm X dynamic between Professor X and Magneto is blended with a plot and visual style straight out of a 1960s spy movie. Now, it\'s more like a really good Matt Helm flick than James Bond, but these filmmakers use that groovy look and sensibility to create one of the best representations of classic super-hero imagery without it feeling too ""comic booky"". By funneling super-hero tropes through the 60s spy genre, it almost effortlessly normalizes them without having to compromise them.The script juggles a big cast better than any other X-film and about as well as any action flick ever has. Yeah, most of them are cannon fodder or cardboard stand ins, but they\'re never obtrusive or annoying and they all orbit quite well around the quartet at the heart of the story. The mutant vs. human debate of Professor X and Magento is unfolded into an assimilation vs. racial pride standoff between Mystique and the Beast (Nicholas Hoult). The script even manages to expertly mirror its era by giving Magneto the revolutionary appeal of 1960s social turmoil, and casting Professor X as too weak and accommodating, which deliciously plays off the template of the first two X-films where Magneto was the aging radical still grasping at revolution while the Professor\'s approach had actually built something meaningful and lasting.The action scenes are good, though they become less effective as they become more overtly super-heroic. There are a couple of tremendous cameos. The continuity of the first two X-films is mostly respected and enhanced. And this movie finally resolves an argument that started with the original motion picture. Yes, Magneto\'s comic book helmet does look kind of goofy when you faithfully reproduce in the real world.First Class doesn\'t have the dramatic depth of X-Men or United, but it\'s a fun, funny and exciting summer experience. It\'s a shame the flaws of The Last Stand or Wolverine may have soured folks on mutant cinema and scared them away from this one but if you enjoyed the first two films at all, you should definitely give this one a look.', ""Normally prequel movies are made because the main characters of the first movie died (or in the end achieved their goals) and the producers still want to make money out of the franchise. Think Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, Psycho, the (still to be made?) I am legend and of course George Lucas's Star Wars saga. X-Men First Class also falls into that category, but I cannot imagine that anybody will be complaining about that. Director Matthew Vaughn created a great, thrilling and sometimes even moving picture that without any doubt will get raving reviews and be a huge commercial success. God knows both movie and director deserve it.What makes X-Men First Class really work is the great story. It tells us about the beginning of the mutants and especially the friendship between professor X (a charming James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr/Magneto (an impressive Michael Fassbender). Although they will drift apart at some time, you know that they will always have respect for each other. In this stage they even become close friends. The movie opens during World War 2, when young boy Erik is taken to a concentration camp (like the opening of the first X-Men movie). There he meets Sebestian Shaw (a great Kevin Bacon), a scary Joseph Mengele-like scientist who likes to experiment on Jews and is especially interested in mutants. In order to force Erik into helping him he shoots his mother. Erik never forgives him for that and spends his whole life looking for revenge. Unfortunately he learns that Shaw is also a mutant. The scientist is even so powerful that it's almost impossible for Erik to kill him. Luckily he bumps into Charles Xavier...What I also like about First Class is that the movie takes place in the past (the sixties) and uses historical events (the Cuba crisis and the Cold War) to make its point. Erik claims that no matter how many times mutants save the world, normal people will always see them as enemies. Professor X still wants to believe in the good of the people. With that message the foundation is laid for X-Men 1-3.The performances in First Class are first rate. Kevin Bacon is a brilliant villain. His German is actually quite good and his opening scene can already be considered as a classic. He also speaks Russian in the movie by the way. Michael Fassbender (Magneto) represents the most exciting drama in the story. He's kinda like Darth Vader. You know he will turn to the Dark Side but you still hope that somehow he will stick with professor X.First Class will be the beginning of super stardom for actress Jennifer Lawrence. She plays Raven in the story, a girl Xavier adopts as a real sister/best friend. She later becomes Mystique. Jennifer won critical acclaim with her role in Winter Bone and will play the lead in the much anticipated The Hunger Games movie, to be released in 2012. She is a great, vulnerable Mystique who later on chooses Magneto over 'her brother' Professor X. So what's more to tell? January Jones as Emma Frost is sexy as hell, the special effects in the movie are great and there are not one but two cameos from actors from the first X-Men movie (and no, the second one is not Patrick Stewart). Unlike previous Marvel movies there is no extra scene after the end credits and Stan Lee does not have a small part in this one. Overall First Class makes you think of the Sean Connery Bond movies and the reboot of Star Trek (2009).So... are you convinced? Just go see this excellent movie. Can't wait for its sequel!9/10"", ""The success of the prequel, X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009 seems to have prompted the movie makers to shift focus to prequels. In First Class, the story goes back even further and traces the lives of Professor-X/ Charles Xavier and Magneto/ Erik Lehnsherr, their friendship and their eventual fallout. Although the X-Men trilogy had done good business in the last decade, prolonging the same would have meant more battles between Xavier's X-men and Magneto's Brotherhood of mutants on their differences on how to deal with humans. But, in a prequel, the story can be altered";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Often Siddharth Malhotra utters a dialogue which he believes will be a sensation only for it to fall flat and forgettable.

The only reason why this movie has got high rating is because of a certain group of people in India who are hyper nationalist and they have given this movie a high rating.But in all honesty avoid this film, its just too bad.', ""Plot/Storyline - there would literally be 500+ movies made in Hollywood and about 100 in Bollywood, but based on an assumption that most people dont use logic Directorand storytellers have used even a bit of logic and emotional melodrama is just icing on the cake Keep a headache pill handy.Sidharth Malhotra - he is not a solidier in the movie he has played a superhero who can dodge bullets from 2 meter distance and ofcourse he can kill many people with his bare hands. He just wouldn't die whatever terrorists do. Malhotra lacks expressions he is better off as a model. Can't say more than that..\nRasshi Khanna is horrible as a task force chief, not at all commanding as a chief should be..looks more like a school teacher.

His acting was good ...Action packed movie it will not bore you at all. It will give good action satisfaction ..... Go and watch it... Energy level of the story is good.... Story is typical but action is full packed and it will not bore u at all...Disha patani did justice to her role...Sidharth has been quite unlucky in case of box office but his movies has been good...I hope this movie will be a comeback to his box office career ...

Kong: Skull Island;2017;Action, Adventure, Fantasy;6.7;PG-13;62;Jordan Vogt-Roberts;Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, John Goodman, Corey Hawkins, John Ortiz, Tian Jing, Toby Kebbell, Jason Mitchell, Shea Whigham, Thomas Mann, Eugene Cordero, Marc Evan Jackson, Will Brittain, Miyavi, Richard Jenkins, Allyn Rachel;After the Vietnam war, a team of scientists explores an uncharted island in the Pacific, venturing into the domain of the mighty Kong and must fight to escape a primal Eden.;"['Similar to a number of Godzilla films from the \'90\'s, \'Kong\' turns out to be a guardian monster (despite the carnage with which he greets Samuel Jackson\'s crew of tough \'Nam vets) who protects humans from some existential threat, in this case, vicious two-legged lizard-kaiju (\'Skullcrawlers\') from the bowels of the Earth. The film follows the usual trajectory: John Goodman assembles a team of soldiers, a retired SAS spook, a bunch of generic scientists, and hot-shot female photographer to travel to Skull Island, the last undiscovered land on the planet, as part of his obsession to find evidence for a hollow earth and giant monsters. After a \'first act\' of mood-drenched slow-mo shots of helicopters, classic 60/70\'s rock and roll, tough-guy posturing, bro-bonding, and fish-out-of-water shtick, they get to the titular Island, where things immediately go bad. The expedition promptly gets split into two (one group learns the truth, the other is consumed by a need for revenge). All of this sets up a series of action scenes where humans (ineffectively) and Kong (effectively) fight the skullcrawlers. The film is not connected to the original King Kong story and Kong himself is not intended to be a giant gorilla, but rather the last of some primordial species. As such, while his head is certainly gorilla-like, his body and posture is more like a very hairy Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson with simian hands and feet. Despite this odd hybrid status, the titular kaiju looks very good and the CGI for both him and his adversaries is outstanding, as is the scenery (real and otherwise) seen at the beginning of the film. Unfortunately, the story is not as good as the visuals, relying on too many improbabilities, contrivances, and coincidences to be taken seriously. An entertaining, but not memorable film with little \'watch it again\' appeal.', ""This is a really cool movie! It's not deep or complex, but it's visually great and a lot of fun."", 'Not even sure what to say about this one. Kong was 950 feet tall. And sweet. So sweet. Unless you threatened him or made him angry. Which they managed to do. I think pretty much anything that Samuel Jackson is in these days, must be avoided like the Bird flu. He is a compromised actor of extreme proportions, and will literally do anything for a buck. He is so tired. His routine is so old. Here he plays an army officer, who of course has no respect for nature, animals, or the earth. Hence the environmental statement. It is a statement that feels like it was written by a 5 year old. Hollywood being the nearly culturally bankrupt institution it is, seems to be incapable of a balance, nuanced, elegant statement of any sort. So, they keep producing this kind on inane garbage.Why did 14 helicopter pilots, when faced with a 950 foot tall Kong, who has a wing span the size of several football fields, fly within swat range of this beast? Was it not possible they could have done any better than that? Does Hollywood really need to continue to insult us at every possible opportunity? The only redeeming quality this movie had was John C. Reilly. His comic touch was all that kept me from walking out on this turkey. Hollywood, you can do better than this. You need to stop catering to Chinese teenagers. This movie was terrible.', ""My review is short and sweet.Half the people on here saw it on the day it leaked - just check review dates - and on their phone screens and then can't understand why they didn't really like it.Not much you can do for those people if they choose to cheat themselves out of a great movie experience, but just don't let them cheat you out of one.This is a very well put together movie with excellent everything including cast, sound, graphics, plot, lines, cinematography, you name it.Can't do more than point you in the direction of a good movie and up to you to watch it or not, but in my book, this Kong was King."", ""I want to start off by saying that I am not going to sit here and pretend to be above wanting to see a 100-foot tall ape shred through some giant lizards and whatnot for around 2 hours.If you were worried that Kong would wait 40 minutes to show the action only to cut-away when the fan makes contact with the feces, then you can put those worries to rest because this giant hairy grump is in your face right off the bat.I could immediately tell that this film wasn't about to shy away from what we all craved so dearly in 2014's Godzilla, because from the first gunshot onward this script hauls some serious behind straight toward that colorful Skull Island which we were all so eager to see from the trailers.Now, I have learned from a number of painful years that discipline is a key ingredient both behind the camera and beneath the projector. I like to think that my expectations were fair. I did not look at any reviews at any point before I hit that seat on that Thursday night - popcorn and drink in hand. I was ready, man.If I told you that the neat visuals surrounding the lineup of lovecraftian nasties rendered into digital existence to confront the titular ape was enough to save this picture, then I would be lying straight to your face.Yes, of course we get to see a glorious pair of giant angry ape fists make heavy and satisfying contact with: Some helicopters, a couple of lizards without legs (which is funny, because the T-Rexes in Peter Jackson's King Kong lacked arms), a giant squid because, you know, we needed 5 seconds of squid footage in the trailer I guess, more lizards, and a big lizard whose sole purpose in life is to rustle some serious jimmies.But unfortunately, these scenes are sprinkled between around 2 hours of having the camera choppily bob and weave between two separate groups containing some of the most boring and uninteresting characters I have ever come to forget. There is a cardboard hero who is good at everything that the script needs him to be good at, a photographer who takes, like, pictures I guess, and John C. Reilly, who is arguably the closest this film gets to an interesting character.And this is not because of the script. This is because he is John C. Reilly adding his own touch to the script he was given, like Gordon Ramsay doing his best after being handed a bag of plain rice and half of a dildo.Everybody else is a nameless nothing that we get to see be picked off by giant insects in front of some of the worst green screen I have seen in some time. Good, lord. What time of day was it again? Because I swear to sweet baby Christ on a cracker that the sun set about six or seven different times in the same day.The helicopter's encounter followed (after seemingly quite some time) by the final throw-down between Kong and captain ptorsodactyl mcwigglynoodle was what truly got me through the cringe-inducing humor and painfully humorous deaths.This is one of those red-box gems that you'll have a better time with once there is a beer in your hand rather than a 7 dollar popcorn.03/10"", 'The second film in the Legendary MonsterVerse, Kong: Skull Island reboots and remakes King Kong for a new generation that would see the 70\'s remake as silly, the Peter Jackson film as old and if that last statement is true, would think that the 1933 original was some kind of archaeological find like the Shroud of Turin. In 1944* and 1973, Kong has made his presence known as war continues to intrude on Skull Island. This leads Bill Randa (John Goodman), head of the U. S. government organization Monarch, to send a team to that island to find out exactly what\'s going on with the monsters that have emerged. Once there, Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel Jackson), former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) and seismologist Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins, playing the younger version of the character from Godzilla: King of the Monsters) begin dropping seismic explosives and mapping the island before Kong attacks. The battle separates the scientists and soldiers, with Packard wanting to kill Kong and the others meeting the natives and discovering that the big beast is the last of his kind, protecting the island and its natives from the Skullcrawlers that wiped out its entire family. By the end, Kong is victorious and has proved his true good nature. Monarch recruits Conrad and Weaver, while revealing that Kong is not alone, revealing cave paintings of Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah. I\'m excited to see what happens next, as the films have placed both Kong and Godzilla on the same emotional playing field. They\'re both the last of their kind, dealing with the loss of their race to an enemy (the Skullcrawlers and the Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) and are absolute predators. However, Godzilla has no interest in human beings while Kong serves as their protector. Who knew that a modern King Kong movie would reference seventies films like The Conversation and Apocalpyse Now, somehow becoming one of the best films in the series? Here\'s to being pleasantly surprised. * I love that John C. Reilly\'s character has been on the island since World War II. He also has on a jacket that references Kaneda\'s in Akira: ""Good for your health, bad for your education.""', 'Sadly, this movie is not as iconic as the first movie. When first released in 1933, \'King Kong\' broke all previous box-office records, becoming one of the very first blockbuster in film history. It was a phenomenal, influential landmark film that raised the bar for special effects for many decades. It was so good, that the film was remade, multiply times";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all";"[""I'm a big fan of Nolan and having some complexity to movies but it should not be the whole plot, if you don't take into account the time reverse thing the movie is really empty and it's just a bad action movie. The time thing is not interesting enough to be the whole movie. The scene that are supposed to at suspense don't have your attention because you are trying to understand the plot. The acting isn't great, the character are not putting emotion into it, and I thing the form of the movies where it never stop is not letting them doing anything. Overall it's not that bad of a movie but it's too complicated and the actor are not helping it at all."", ""On first viewing I will agree with many that the movie is a little difficult to follow . It's a demanding watch on plenty of levels . Where Interstellar and Inception both spent plenty of time throughout the film introducing the science behind it all Tenet ignores it , mostly . They do spell out the concept in a couple of brief scenes but then abandon any science in favour of action .There is plenty of relentless high voltage action if that's your thing and some genuine stunt work was great to see but it all becomes a little pointless if you don't really understand why it's all happening .If you don't like it really loud take some ear plugs . The score is thundering but a little overused for my liking . It is accomplished and brilliant film making but my first impressions were that I just didn't enjoy it as much as some of his previous films . I'll start with a 7 but I believe it has the potential to grow on me . It is a visual treat that's for sure ."", 'I\'m not gonna lie, first viewing was a big letdown. As a Nolan fan myself, I was shocked to see what I considered ""annoying bad"" writing and sound design. The sound design still is a problem as of writing this, but upon second viewing, it was like a little switch flicked on every time I saw something I didn\'t understand from the last viewing. The little details that I considered bad writing suddenly seemed like an obvious answer. The cheesy parts I thought were, well cheesy, had so much more depth. I\'m not going to spoil it, but thinking about The Protagonist and Neil makes me feel so many emotions that upon second viewing never made me feel the way I did, truly beautiful. No movie is perfect, this one definitely isn\'t perfect. This is no Dunkirk or Inception, but I guarantee this movie will make you use your brain.', ""I'd suggest people read the synopsis on Wikipedia before watching the time. Otherwise it would be too hard to follow. If you're the type of person who enjoys watching a movie multiple times and dissecting it then you'll enjoy Tenet"", ""I've seen a lot of hate for Tenet, but I honestly believe the movie will age very well, and a lot of the people who hate it now will come to realize just how ahead of its time it is. I will admit that it prioritizes concept over plot and character, and hard-to-hear dialogue has become a recurring problem for Nolan. But the movie is great, and I like it more the more I think about it. You don't need to be super smart to understand it, as some diehard Nolan fans claim, but I believe you do need to be fascinated enough by the philosophy of time to make it a pleasant experience. Without that, I think the movie will bore you and that boredom will probably lead you to miss some key points needed to fill in the puzzle. Filling in the puzzle doesn't mean you'll like it though, because this movie is an experimental thriller disguised as a blockbuster, which is not what people expected.Hey, maybe I'm wrong, but I expect the love for this movie will grow over the years."", ""Like many others I felt kind of dumb after watching this movie. And I suspect that is the whole point. Nolan wants to feel smart by writing an incomrehensible story that only he understands. The directing is great in general, although I did get a bit annoyed after a while by the constant jumping between places (if that is part of the directing i dunno whatever). And the name dropping and little tidbits of sciency factoids is kind of silly as well. It could've been much more enjoyable as a simple action movie with a shorter runtime and if one haven't had to pay attention to every second.I realize I might have been too generous with my rating after writing this, lol"", ""Listen we all know Nolan swings for the fences of what's possible and pushes the realms of normality. This film for whatever reason just doesn't mesh together the way most of his films do even with complex suspension of disbelief aspects. It's often scattered and juxtaposed to a near outrageous level. The visuals are spectacular at times but also seem way too extravagant to take seriously other times. Robert Pattinson is flawless and probably the standout of the film with his vigorous performance. The same cannot be said about John David Washington's barren and emotionless lack of effort. I can't believe he was given the starring role. He brings the interest level down to almost unwatchable levels. Overall this is one of Nolan's rare misfires which he is capable of once in awhile."", 'The speech is very mumbled and not clear. The audio dialogue needs remixing and the background score and effects need lowering in volume. The character builds are non-existent. The plot is predictable. Action and special effects are very good but not ground breaking in this age when anyone can really shoot HD and then play it back backwards. Needs a second watch with sub titles.', ""I respect the cinematic art that is Tenet. It's just something you experience- and if you try to follow the plot it will be confusing. But in this case, that confusion is intentional and one thing is obvious, this film is an intentional well planned out vision of Christopher Nolan. That confidence and certainty of a director is what you respect. Many great filmmakers make strange mind bending films. I think the action in Tenet was entertaining and the concept was interesting. But I feel it came up short given the storytelling ability of Christopher Nolan.I think a top tier director like Nolan has a responsibility to level the tension. A film that's super intense for 2 1/2 hours straight is stressful. The audience has to do a lot of work to try to figure out what's going on and it's exhausting. You need to pull back and let some of it simmer. I think Nolan has entered the echo chamber stage of his career. No one's going to tell him no, or that somethings not right.**this paragraph doesn't have spoilers per say, as no one knows what this film is really about- but it you haven't seen the film, spoiler alert. I feel the Indian lady (aka oracle master weapons dealer) was flat and her entire subplot could have been cut out. And I wished the opening opera scene tied into the plot more- and I think there was too much plot being revealed through dialogue. The actors were having to explain the plot- and it still didn't make sense even to them! HahaI did enjoy it. Judging on a Nolan curve, I would give it a B+. I think it's probably his fourth best film. They will probably shower it with Oscars, but 10 years from now I don't think anybody's going to be quoting Tenant or talking about it, because it's unclear what it was about- without having it explained to you in a director's commentary. And Inception and Interstellar both played with time better than Tenet.Even though it was clearly visionary, a unique piece of art that plays with the rules of the medium and the backwards action stuff was innovative... in the end, the bad guy wasn't charismatic enough and the good guys were too busy explaining the world to each other, and the ending wasn't amazing. But it was highly entertaining and that's all you can ask for."", 'If you can, get to a cinema and watch Tenet.If you can, watch it in IMAX.If you can, watch it twice.The film takes reality and plays it backwards and forwards at the same time. A mind bending, action packed experience like never seen in cinema before.', ""One of Christopher Nolan's most fascinating movies yet . The inversion concept is unique & outstanding. The performances are excellent. The cinematography is super. Some scenes are simply breath taking. It's a visual art. The action and practical effects are incredible. It does require a lot of concentration and possibly multiple watches."", 'Whilst I admired the cinematography, the backing soundtrack and music was too loud, sometimes louder than the dialogue.\nTwo and a half hours seemed to go on and on with not much happening, a lot of repeating itself?\nPerhaps I am that average film goer and should stick to Eurovision.\nThe six people in our screening stayed very quiet.\nI liked the Michael Caine cameo appearance.', ""Christopher Nolan? The man who keeps delivering.. I feel so stupid after seeing his movies the first time, but yet I'm still so impressed. He makes a movie, which I love, but not quite understand completely. I can't stop thinking about it and after some hours, I slowly start to make sense.Tenet was terrific, even tho my brain felt blended."", ""Christopher Nolan's latest head-scratching thriller is a far cry from INCEPTION, although as a blockbuster action film in the Bond mould it's fairly enjoyable.

The story follows two lifelong friends and a beautiful nurse who are caught up in the horror of an infamous Sunday morning in 1941.;"[""PEARL HARBOR is an attempt by Michael Bay to do what James Cameron did on TITANIC: create an epic romance surrounding a real-life historical disaster plot. Unfortunately, the romance takes the form of the cheesiest love triangle ever, with boring Ben Affleck and struggling Josh Hartnett competing for the affection of the entirely wooden Kate Beckinsale. This laborious, badly-written, long-winded nonsense means that PEARL HARBOR clocks in with a three hour running time, but the truth of it is that at least two hours of said running time is pure padded excess. No matter how many famous cast members they add to the mix, there's no getting around all of the cliches and the monotonous nature of the human interaction. The good news is that the attack itself takes the form of a forty-minute set-piece sequence which is quite exhilarating, utilising some very good CGI effects and non-stop explosive stunts to make it a truly impressive and immersive experience. The rest can be safely ignored, and if you're looking for a definitive version of this story, I'd recommend TORA! TORA! TORA!."", ""Unlike some other war movies, Gallipoli, Full Metal Jacket etc Pearl Harbor seems to be more focused on entertaining rather than deep characterisation of a morales tale.So not looking for the answers to those deep questions regarding war, this is a movie of love, loss, action and entertainment.I'm not sure fun is the right word so lets go with enjoyable.Its a long film that keeps you engaged and interested the entire time.What more can we really ask?"", 'Ignoring the claims that this movie was so wonderful because Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are ""so-o-o-o-o hot,"" and that the ""music was so-o-o-o good,"" I want to talk about all the historical inaccuracies about this movie. People get the impression that by watching the movie, they will understand not one, but two historical WWII events: Pearl Harbor and Doolittle\'s Raid. However, this is just not so. While extra care was given for the attack scene (I think WWII veterans would have crucified the producers if this had not been so), the other smaller details give the watcher a false sense of history. For one thing, no Red Cross Army nurses died (as they portray Betty dying). Also, no US soldier would go to Britain to join the Royal Air Force. The US Army Air Force had a unit (the Flying Tigers) in Britain helping out the RAF, but no US soldier would actually leave his unit to join another country\'s military (regardless of allies). It would mean a total US military discharge AND rejecting US citizenship. Ben Affleck\'s character could not have done that, especially when he was not a British citizen. Also, Ben and Josh Hartnett\'s characters were fighter pilots. NOT Bomber pilots. The two are very separate things. Ben and Josh could never switch from being fighter pilots to bombers for Doolittle\'s Raid. The Army Air Force had pilots for all kinds of missions, and fighter pilots stayed fighter pilots, and bombers stayed bombers. Continuing with Doolittle\'s raid, it did NOT turn the tide for the Americans. It was not a military victory, and little in Tokyo was affected. It only served as propaganda to help the US citizens on the homefront (also, Doolittle\'s Raid was long after Pearl Harbor and not a revenge mission). Watch this movie if you\'re into sappy love stories, but NOT if you want to learn about Pearl Harbor (and/or the Doolittle Raid). Few historical facts can be gleaned from this movie.', ""I've never written a review before but after seen how many people are saying this film I thought I better.\nI actually think the film was great the main premise of the film which I feel most people have completely missed is a bond between two guys that is as strong as a brotherhood hood.

And maybe it was just me but I really did feel the emotions that they feel throughout the film.

There hasn\'t been a big-budget re-enactment of the Pearl Harbor attack since Tora! Tora! Tora! in 1970, and, due to the utter failure of this movie on every level, it\'s unlikely it will be attempted again for a long, long time.The writing is ludicrous. It\'s a series of situations and set pieces strung together without a single regard given to character development or even plausibility. The acting is beneath contempt. Ben Affleck should never have been let anywhere near this film, and in the ""love"" scenes between himself and Kate Beckinsdale, it appears patently obvious that the actors completely detest each other. The attack scene is filmed and edited like a Saturday morning cartoon. And...excuse me...in real life Pearl Harbor was a DEFEAT. There was none of the stupid garbage with slick fighter jocks dogfighting Japanese Zeros. This film makes it look like a victory! And, excuse me...FDR could not stand up by himself. The scene in the cabinet room where he rises from his chair was simply laughable.This film is beyond bad. It is insulting. It\'s a 6-year-old\'s coloring book passed off as history. Aside from that, it\'s probably the limpest, shoddiest big-budget ""epic"" produced in the last 10 years. The day it opened in theaters was truly a day of infamy.', ""Contains Spoiler!!

While I don't agree with some of the negative reviews by critics, I acknowledge that everyone has different tastes in movies.

However, I do think that Chris Evans's chemistry and comedy with Jenny Slate in the 2017 movie 'Gifted' was much better. Anna de Armas' acting impressed me, she did a great job playing a spy in this movie and although Chris Evans didn't play a superhero or spy in this movie this wasn't his best performance, he did do just ok. Additionally, I appreciated that the movie wasn't too long and the change of scenes in different countries was impressive. However, I do think the trailer gives away too much, so it's best to avoid it. While the story didn't keep me guessing, I still found it engaging and worth watching. Overall, I would recommend this movie, especially if you're a fan of action, adventure, comedy, and a bit of romance. Catch it on Apple TV+!"", ""Ghosted wrestles with its tone as it decides whether it's a goofy rom-com or a more serious spy thriller. While very much in the vein of Knight and Day or The Killers, Ghosted doesn't stay committed to comedy throughout. The jokes come and go, with Chris Evans taking most of the comedy side and Ana de Armas taking most of the action. The tone might be conflicted, but the fun never stops. Solid action sequences, car chases, exotic locations, and elegant gowns and suits - Ghosted has all the essential elements of a classic spy film. The jokes land better than The Gray Man's quips, and the action is better than Red Notice's set pieces giving Ghosted a slight edge over its streaming adventure competition. It's a flawed movie for certain, with an out-of-place soundtrack and identity crisis, but what it does well makes it interesting enough for a watch and possibly even a sequel. ...maybe."", ""Yet another straight-to-streaming action-comedy-thriller with shoddy action, few laughs, and no thrills.There is not a single original bone in this movie's body. Every plot point, every character, every set piece is lifted from another movie and watered down till there's no distinct flavor.The entire film is really just Knight and Day (2010) but infinitely worse, with stale fights and pedestrian humor.The star-studded A-list cast is left floundering, and they're unable to bring nothing special to their characters. It takes a special kind of incompetent to get bland performances out of these acclaimed actors.The most egregious thing that annoyed me was the music. Whoever this music supervisor was needs to lose their job and be banished from the industry, because EVERY single placement of licensed music was baffling and dissonant with its respective scene.Everyone involved in this movie's production needs to be slapped with a fine and given a sentence of community service, for so shamelessly making content as soulless and derivative as this.The only reason this gets a 2 and not a 1 is because there was one extended celebrity cameo scene that made me laugh and was legitimately clever."", ""Crazy, silly and outrageous!

If you want something to make you laugh, and just to enjoy something outrageous and foolhardy, this is a fairly good movie to watch.The actors do a fairly good job considering the silly characters that they are playing.

This movie is a fun way to spend 2 hours and It is not a movie that you will regret watching. The script is a little basic,sure,but as I have said the movie a typical romance action-comedy with 2 attractive actors,so I didn't expect something wonderfully written and you shouldn't too.My final conclusion is that this a decent movie worth watching and I think you should give it a watch.7/10."", ""Yet another Apple original film flop, where they throw tons of money to an all star cast into a movie that felt like it was written and directed by a fifth grade drama class.

It's frustratingly badly written - hollow, generic, lazy, and contrived. Even the attempts at humor will create more eye-rolls than laughs. I'm shocked how these normally-talented writers came up with such garbage. Even the cheesy dialogue started to become unbearable.Evans and de Armas have zero chemistry throughout the entire film. It all felt fake and forced. I'm a fan of both actors, but de Armas was annoying in this mess. Everything from her demeanor, accent and acting was unconvincing. I'm sure most of the blame falls to bad cast directing. Even Adrien Brody as the villain was laughably unbelievable, and his French-ish accent was cringeworthy and fake. I'm not sure if his character was supposed to come across as funny, but it was all eye-rolls when you hear his dialogue.To make matters worse, the ridiculously long 116 minutes - even with mostly decent pacing, was riddled with plot and technical issues, full of eye-candy filler with very little substance, and the little substance it did have, was all cliched and generic. It literally is unwatchable nonsense you'll struggle to sit through its entire runtime. Do yourself a favor, even if you're a fan of any of the A-list cast, ghost this boring action-comedy-romance-adventure film. It's a generous 4/10 from me, all for pity to the all star cast, and the decent production value - or tax write-off for Apple."", ""All these 1s and 2s are ridiculous. I gave it an 8 rating just to bring the average up, because I'd hate for anyone to miss out on the fun due to the poor average rating. This movie was just fun, silly, and over the top action.

But sometimes you just want to watch something that doesn't challenge your mind in any way, but just provides relaxation and fun.I had no expectations of a great film, just the hope of entertainment, and that's exactly what I got.

John Travolta delivers a charismatic performance as Mason, a seasoned thief attempting a complex score. The heist itself is decently staged, but the plot relies on a predictable twist and underdeveloped characters.While there are some fun moments, particularly the banter between Travolta and his team, the shaky camerawork and forgettable action sequences hold the film back. The biggest missed opportunity lies in the supporting cast. Actors like Kristin Davis and Lukas Haas are wasted in roles that lack depth.Cash Out isn't a complete wash. Travolta's performance is engaging, and there's enough action to keep things mildly thrilling. But for a truly satisfying heist experience, you're better off looking elsewhere."", ""Instead of focusing and just saying how this movie was A fun one to watch, I have noticed that there are numerous reviews that have really brought down the rating of this movie, and let me tell you something about it, -Do Not Believe It-!!

Yeah there are some illogical plot holes, and it does feel like the movie might have been edited A bit to short, but in all it's really A decent movie."", 'After 67 years of life I have to admit to seeing the WORST movie ever produced.Not only is the script utterly appalling, but the acting was even worse.Disbelief that such a character as John Travolta would lower himself speaks volumes to his financial situation, and sadly, desperation to take on such a demeaning role.Generally speaking this movie was appalling and totally unbelievable.The idea that an fbi person would take sympathy on a career criminal stretches imagination way too far to even mention and to which they surely would not go close to agreeing to, let alone sanctioning, amid their disbelief.', ""The movie was full of action. Very well thought out for the Plot. Could have used less Drone Footage, kinda plays with your head, otherwise, yea will watch again. Travolta showing his age, but for Travolta he seems to be Ageless now a days, he's always good in films not matter the genre. This role was made for him and he succeeded to play the hell out of it. Lucas Hass wow from a kid to now, he's come along way in the film industry and did all the characters in the Movie. Will recommend this movie to all my friends and like I said will re watch again which normally i do only for a select few movies, enjoy the Film."", ""There are several points where Cash Out failed for me. To explain that I will have to separate the film into two halves. In part one during the initial heist, Travolta and the cast bring off their roles very well. Each of the characters plays their part with understated humour and panache. The set is stylish and in the fashion of some of the great heist films it fulfills and leaves you wanting more. I would rate that a solid seven stars.Where Cash Out fails for me is setting up the group for the failure leading into the film's second half. The further characterizations and character development needed to set up this part of the film are ignored. Perhaps budget restraints and a weak written plot are at fault. In any event, there is not enough focus given to the love affair between the two many characters. Why is a master thief, and an FBI undercover agent so deeply in love? How did the relationship develop? What was the imperative that made their love so strong? Alongside this is what was going on with the less talented brother that he needed to get his brother out of his slump.I found the direction, and editing to be weak in several areas. There are scenes that for Travolta were obviously difficult, scenes where several characters had to contort to get through several walls. These scenes were clumsily set up and filmed. Yes, it was dark, and it would have been a perfect moment for a character double to show athletic prowess. Travolta may have been slightly miscast for the part. His age, and the fact he appears somewhat overweight, and out of shape to bring off this part of the film seem somewhat implausible. There are also parts of the film where a closeup of Travolta continues too long and just seems awkward.To give Travolta his due, his acting chops for much of the film were on point.As well as these plot black holes many smaller plot holes weaken the story";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It has the perfect balance of action and storyline. It expands the world with more backstory and characters, and the effects were better so it was more convincing and we felt like we were part of this world. The casting was quite fitting.', ""Ever since I first saw it in theaters, Catching Fire has been one of my favorite movies of all time. It's so much better than the first one. It explores the story's political conflict more deeply and greatly expands on the dystopian universe.The new director gives it a fresh and improved vision. The first one had audiences criticizing the shaky and desaturated camerawork and this sequel fixed it. Even though one this movie involves Katniss and Peeta competing in the games again, it never feels like a repeat of the first one. They understand that viewers already know how the games work and take advantage of the chance to explore new concepts with it.Catching Fire should be an example to all filmmakers of how to do a good sequel."", ""From the acting to the sets to the special effects, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is an exceptional film. This movie is long, but it doesn't feel watered down or stretched out - there is plenty of story and action to fill the time. Plus, Jennifer Lawrence doesn't have to carry the movie on her own. The supporting cast does an excellent job, as well. This film can't really stand on its own, but it's still a fun ride and a well-done adaptation of the book."", 'Yes, it is to me. Well, like most of you out there, I was so hyped for this film to come out, but tried to lower down my expectations, and when I finally saw it, it kind of left me dumbfounded, because of the ending. Of course, you can call me unfair in the first place because I haven\'t read the original book, but if this film is truly faithful to the book, either that the novel is not my cup of tea, or that the story elements doesn\'t translate well onto the screen. Yeah, my problem with this film is with some of the plot elements.First of all, some of the scenes in the first half seems to just continue to drag on and on, until it gets boring, or at least, uninteresting. It really affects the pacing of the whole movie and doesn\'t make up for the real deal during the second half, which seemed a little too short, and rushed. The game can be quite intense, but instead of seeing tributes slaughtering each other, you mostly get the tributes forming a nice, friendly group, trying to avoid \'natural disasters\', and then lots of talking. I mean the idea of the clock is unique and interesting, but it is completely missing the point of what the game is, or at least that\'s what the audience is seeing only. Most of the deaths are off-screen, otherwise they are deaths of man-made animals. Before you can say ""Hey! What are they going to do after..."", the plot twists, and it just suddenly ends, abruptly. Its like they are doing their best to remind you that there is another Hunger Games movie in the making, be sure to check that out!!! Seriously? Otherwise, the acting is really not bad at all, and it has some neat ideas. If you really love the book, you would most probably love this too, otherwise, you might not understand.', '(SORT OF SPOILERS...but not really)50 Minutes of 65mm IMAX. The director who introduced the world to serious Will Smith (or re-introduced). And the hottest, most-wanted, A- List actress. And yet......you can\'t help but yawn. More than once, unfortunately. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" opens months after the ""The Hunger Games"" (an awful excuse of an ode to Suzanne Collins masterpiece, even though she was heavily involved with production) as we find Katniss Everdeen suffering from extreme moments of PTSD. We watch her endure the fake, Capitol induced life and the desire for the simplicity of that in District 12. The opening of the film is strong. Actually- almost near-perfect. Much darker and more visually attractive, these sparse moments give you a feeling that the film could actually live up to everything it should be. Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend"", ""Constantine"", ""Water for Elephants"") works hard to undo previous director Gary Ross\' established bland visuals, and succeeds. But the cinematography can\'t save the shaky dialogue and pacing. Watching Katniss and Peeta\'s struggle through the tour is beautiful. It really is. And the revelation of the Quarter Quell plays out exactly as you hope. It\'s after the emotional tension releases that we\'re left with a boring shell of a film. The acting breaks (even J. Lawrence\'s..sometimes), the pacing seems as though the writers gave up, and the visual effects...well, it\'s nice to see that the VFX artists from 1980 wanted to keep the same continuity between the horrid attempts in this film and the awfulness of the first one. But, it makes a comeback...sort of. As soon as the Quell starts- BAM. You\'re back in it. The charming use of 65mm IMAX is a nice touch, but immediately reminds you, ""oh yeah- I\'m NOT watching \'The Dark Knight Rises\'...I should probably re-watch that"". Hawai\'i is shown off beautifully, the VFX, again, are not. And the pacing feels rushed. Then slows back down. And then speeds back up. And then slows...and never finds it\'s balance again. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" reminds me a little bit of when I first watched Christopher Nolan\'s ""The Prestige"". I was left with that ""wait...what?!"" feeling. The difference, however, is that ""The Prestige"" is supposed to feel like that. You want to watch it over and over. Films should be like that. Instead, ""Catching Fire"" leaves you feeling that you just want to move on. It can\'t find that perfect balance between beautiful, tragic, and slow";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When he returns to Gotham as Batman, he must stop a secret society that intends to destroy the ci... Read all;"['Batman Begins was a massive breath of fresh air when it came out in 2005. Coming 8 years after Warner Brothers jumped the bat, as it were, with Joel Schumacher\'s childish mess, ""Batman and Robin"", Christopher Nolan\'s Batman Begins brought a maturity and seriousness to The Caped Crusader that had been absent since Tim Burton left the world of Gotham. While Batman Begins might not boast the visual prowess or rich villains of Burton\'s two Batman movies, it fleshed out the character of Bruce Wayne in a way no movie has since.Batman Begins is an origin story straight through, detailing Bruce Wayne\'s (Christian Bale) emergence from tragically scarred child to a symbol of heroism and darkness. After training with Ra\'s al Ghul and the League of Shadows, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham in perfect mental and physical shape. What Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer do perfectly here, is inject Bruce Wayne with an emotion never before seen in a Batman movie. You can feel the pain and grief Wayne is experiencing and you can see why he decides to become a living symbol of good. The first full origin story for Batman on film, Batman Begins is very much told from Bruce\'s point of view. Earlier Batman movies often focused more heavily on developing the villains, leaving Bruce Wayne in the shadows. The approach that keeps Batman a dark, mysterious figure is a valiant one, and it makes sense. However, context rarely hurts, and Batman Begins provides the character with heaps of context. You can clearly understand the emotions and motivations of the man behind the mask. The origin is also utterly believable. You can see why Bruce Wayne dresses like a bat, why he needs a cape, how he gets a super-car and super-gadgets, and why he hides in a cave. Does it strip Batman of his mythic status? Yes, a bit. Luckily, unlike Nolan\'s two follow-ups, Begins doesn\'t get too carried away with realism, retaining a comic book style that its successor would forget.While it does take a while for Bruce Wayne to fully become the bat, it is worth it. Once Bruce Wayne finally dons the cape and cowl, there are a few jaw-dropping action scenes including a brilliant batmobile chase scene and a thrilling climax on Gotham\'s elevated trains. The atmosphere and feeling of Gotham City is nearly perfect in it\'s own way. It does not have the Gothic beauty of Tim Burton\'s Batman universe, but it\'s blend of comic book dinginess and contemporary sleekness makes Gotham a terrifically realized cityscape. The city feels like what a comic book world would be like if it actually existed. Batman himself is a dark, brooding, wonderfully realized character in his own right and he shares the screen with an ensemble of great actors. Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon are standouts in an ensemble cast that is playing the comic book material straight as an arrow. Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow is an excellent but criminally underused baddie, but on the whole, the supporting cast elevates the material.Batman Begins is still as fresh today as it was more than a decade ago. The origin of Batman is engaging, engrossing, and emotional. The story provides a context to the Bruce Wayne character that elevates the movie beyond its fun comic book plot. The origin is a satisfying and believable one, and once Batman finally enters the scene, the action is unmatched. Batman Begins is a strong, confident summer superhero blockbuster with more maturity and emotional truth than most dramas. I hesitate to call it the definitive interpretation of Batman (Batman 1989 takes that title), but Batman Begins is the best of Christopher Nolan\'s Batman movies, a film that balances gritty realism, human drama, and thrilling comic book fun.85/100', 'I feel like I\'m always one of those people who rolls their eyes when someone says ""Christopher Nolan is such a great filmmaker"". Sometimes I feel like I\'m being a bit mean. Nolan is an acclaimed director because of his vision for big blockbusters that are shot and film and rely on the spectacle of real sets and performances. Nolan exceeds well at what he tries to do, and its a sort of achievement that no director has accomplished. Personally, I don\'t love his style - it relies more on impressive setpieces then the language of film. But it mostly works. Yet I find this movies to be exactly what Christopher Nolan should not be directing - a fantasy. Because of his vision, and the conflicting interests with this story, I find Batman Begins to be an overlong, drab and rather than unengaging affair.Firstly lets start off with the story. I simply don\'t like this story at all. The stories of each of the movies in the Dark Knight trilogy are very loosely based on Year One, Long Halloween and The Dark Knight Returns respectively. I haven\'t read Year One, but Long Haloween and Dark Knight Returns I know are fantastic - and very different to their movie counterparts. So I won\'t blame the scripts fault on the source material. The problem with this movie to me is how quickly the events of this movie occur. In essence, Bruce Wayne changes from a boy, to a ninja, to the batman in relatively short time. So this exciting arc of Bruce Wayne becoming the Batman is lost immediately. In fact a significant problem with this movie is that it really isn\'t about Batman becoming Batman. It\'s more like ""this is what Batman would do to become a hero"". There needs to be a story about him becoming the figure of batman, maybe learning not to murder or become a better vigilante. Yet halfway through this movie he knows what hes doing. The central conflict, that being Batman to become a hero, is kinda mute and as such there isn\'t much of a thread to hold us onto the story other than ""Batman needs to stop bad guy"".And that\'s another thing - too many antagonists. I feel like no one brings this up, but there are essentially three antagonists in this movie - Carmine Falcone, Scarecrow, and Ra\'s Al Ghul. And they aren\'t really teaming up together - each antagonist gets set up, only to be foiled onto the next villain. If there was a constant driving villain as there was in the Dark Knight, this wouldnt be a problem. However Ra\'s Al Ghul, who is essentially the Big Bad, isn\'t established as a villain until the very last half hour. By that point the movie has failed to really connext with me with an opposition. So to me there becomes no real arc for batman and no real threat for the entire movie. As such, I don\'t really have much to connect with this character.There\'s also the style of Nolan. One of the criticisms I have with Nolan is that scenes kinda blend together, so that there is rarely ""that scene"" in a Nolan movie - its more an event that occurs in a movie. In some movies it works, but in this movie because I\'m not particularly invested in the characters I don\'t care. It\'s a sort of thing you need to do in a fantasy. In real life things don\'t just suddenly start - in the Dark Knight for example you might have a quick little scene with Joker and Gambol because it brings a level of realism. You\'re not seeing the Joker comically do something for four minutes as a normal scene. Yet in a fantasy world you need that. You need, for example a four minute scene where the Scarecrow\'s character is introduced. You need a scene where the city is established (as a fantasy city). When you go into realism it makes sense not to sort of overemphasise or exaggerate the world. Yet Batman Begins is a more fantastical story - it surrounds a group of seemingly magical ninjas, a really poorly designed and unrealistic city and a plot in which fear gas is going to be put into the water. To me this is at conflict with Nolan\'s vision. It would be like making a realistic version of star wars - you can make this movie dark, but it becomes difficult for me to assume this world as ultra realistic. I can\'t accept these characters but only as the works of fiction, and thus the movies can\'t try to trick me.It\'s also of note that this movie is just very poorly helmed when compared to Nolan\'s future work. As an action director I don\'t think Nolan is actually that great. In this movie the action is a lot of shaky cam and quick cuts to give the illusion (very poor illusion) that action is occurring. Along with that there is no real sort of danger for Batman. He perfectly rides his Batmobile and fights with precision. But this is a learner, I guy who hasn\'t properly mastered being a hero. An action movie needs the hero to be endangered, especially when there is otherwise no direct threat. Thre is none here, and as such I find this to be boring.', ""A plunge into the depths creates real fear, as out of darkness swarming beasts cause to appear, later at, the opera, you start to tremble, shake and cower, leads to an exit, where the price is quite severe. Some years later and a journey is begun, from the light into the shadows where you run, as Ra's al Ghul becomes mentor, or is he just, a tormentor, the cycle closes, returning to the forsaken. A new friend is made and doors begin to slide, finding technologies, to halt and stop the tide, tools to fight, the criminals, mobsters without principles, a winged vigilante, in Gotham City, now resides."", 'This film easily trumps any live-action incarnation we\'ve scene of the Dark Knight before, borrowing heavily from both the comics and the Dini and Co. animated series. This is a hard, fast, driving, heartfelt epic that draws you into the character of Bruce Wayne and makes you damn well care. Batman doesn\'t play second-fiddle to the villains here like in the other films. It\'s his movie and that\'s the way it should be.Much has been said of the film\'s ""reality"" quotient, and I\'m here to say it works. Nolan talks about how Batman\'s strong because he does push-ups, he gets around because of his gadgets, and by introducing each of them with a plausible explanation, we forget to quibble and go along with it. The technology may be fantastic, but it\'s believable. And, unlike the ""reality"" of something like Daredevil, Nolan doesn\'t forget his ideals halfway though and start having Batman wire-jump thirty feet into the air.', 'We waited for years to get a new and better ""Batman"" movie than the one we got back in 1997 with ""Batman & Robin"" which was a complete disaster. This movie is probably the best of all the ""Batman"" movies to ever be released. Christopher Nolan reinvents this iconic character in the most humane way we have ever seen the character in before. It\'s also the greatest way we have ever seen. Christian Bale is a very good Batman, but I don\'t believe in his judgment all the time, taking a scene where he is about to kill a man, but fails when the same man is killed by another assassin. I didn\'t really get his full emotion in that scene, but he is still very good. Liam Neeson is the best villain for Batman to take on as he inhabits the iconic villain Ra\'s al Ghul who we all know from the comicbooks. This is a great movie that I can\'t help but love even more every single time I watch the movie.', 'The name of David Goyer among the writing credits made me fear the worse. After all those Zig Zag and Blades appallingness you can hardly blame me. So, you may imagine my surprise to discover that Batman Begins is not only better than the previous Batmans but much better. The genesis of the character as well as inedited insights into the seven mystery years in the life of Bruce Wayne makes the whole enterprise engaging even thrilling. Christian Bale is an American Psycho Batman, pouty lips and unexpected sexual presence. Katie Holmes is lovely, with a sharp intelligence and a riveting imperfect beauty. Michael Caine fills the shoes of the butler with wit and charm. Gary Oldman, looking more Oldman than Gary, adds another surprising characterization to his already impressive gallery. So, very nice. There is still hope in hopeless trends. Who knew.', 'Bale is unintentionally funny as Batman doing his, now infamous Bat-Voice. More silly than intimidating.The dialogue has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer and is delivered in the most melodramatic way possible.Take a shot every time the word ""fear"" or variation of it is said. You\'ll be drunk 30 minutes in.Direction is average at best, shoddy at worst.But, at least Batman fanboys got what they wanted.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I thought it was disturbing, stylish and pretty good for the first half, and was enjoying it.And then they get to the Titty Twister, where there are lots and lots of vampires and lots of blood and nudity, and lots of fighting, and, for me, it just went completely downhill. It felt silly and just inappropriate from what we'd seen at the beginning, and I actually got a little bored.That being said, I really liked Harvey Kietel's performance and George Clooney was much better than I'd thought he'd be. Plus, Salma Hayek is one sexy kitten.So yeah, half a good film. If you love over the top vampire films though complete with dated effects, then go for it, because you might just like it"", ""I enjoyed this film, but I was left a little puzzled at the end by what I'd just watched in terms of what type of movie this is.It starts off as a very Tarantino-esquire film, it's clear that he wrote it as his famous dialogue is present. It's an enjoyable crime thriller much along the lines of Tarantino's other works (such as Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs) but with a bit of Robert Rodriguez flare shown during the action sequences.Then with about 50-ish minutes left, the style film changes entirely. It becomes another film, it goes from stylish crime thriller to random vampire action movie. It's almost as if Tarantino left the room while writing the script and somebody wrote the rest of the film for him, it loses it's Tarantino charm and becomes a predictable, gore fest, vampire flick.I'm a fan of Vampire films, so I still enjoyed the movie, but I can see why others don't like it. The acting is of high quality, especially from Geroge Clooney who outdoes himself, and in parts saves the film.8/10 - Watch with an open mind."", 'I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever, as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I\'m giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) Essentially you\'re thrown from one movie into a completely different one, with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant, which I thought was a great idea. Usually, you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it, you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself, but at a more ""meta"" level you know what Frodo isn\'t going to die in the first book/film.This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately, though, the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose, there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift, but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of, and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies, the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without pay-off, and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset. This robs the movie of a connection between the two stories, as well as a proper resolution. Still, it\'s an entertaining 90 minutes and a must-see cult classic.', ""I have to say that this is actually a good movie although it does lose it's way towards the end. The final 15 minutes I thought were a little crappy. I prefer more realism in my vampires but having said that, I cannot fault Tarantino, his is perfect in the role as the twisted Richard Gecko, and although I don't usually like George Clooney he was surprisingly cool as Seth. There are some funny moments that you have to have a slightly twisted humour to appreciate (which I do!) and as long as you don't take it too seriously, it is an entertaining movie. If you like overacting, lots and lots of blood and Tarantino movies then go see."", ""'From Dusk Till Dawn' is kind of brilliant, brutal, bloody, Tarantino, horror, silly and funny. It is brilliant, brutal, bloody, horror, silly and funny the way Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead'-series is all those things, the twist here is a screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino. This means the first hour is just brutal and bloody, sometimes a little funny, in the 'Pulp Fiction' kind of way.We see two brothers named Seth (George Clooney) and Richie Gecko (Quentin Tarantino). They are bank robbers, although they do the occasional killing as well. We learn they want to reach the Mexican border. That the entire state of Texas and the FBI are looking for them is a problem so they force the Fuller family to bring them across the border with their motor home. Father Jacob (Harvey Keitel) used to be a minister but gave up faith after his wife died in a car crash. He travels with his adopted son Scott (Ernest Liu) and his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis).So we have the first hour, filled with Tarantino-stuff in its dialogue and references, and then the party arrives at a bar called the Titty Twister. Not long after they are inside it is revealed that every crew member from the bar is actually a vampire, feeding themselves on bikers and truckers that visit the place. The Fullers and Geckos survive together with a guy who calls himself Sex Machine (Tom Savini) and a guy named Frost (Fred Williamson). Now they are a team and face vampires as their opponents.You see how this movie is actually two movies. Especially the second part will find a smaller audience and in a way I was a little curious how the first part would have ended if they kept it as serious as it was. Still, because the movie shifts the way it does it becomes quite original. We have a crime movie to start and a horror comedy, really in the Sam Raimi way, to end. If you are able to take it the way it comes, not too serious, there is a good chance you might like it. Even the gore is presented in a silly way, making it less gory.Clooney's cool performance, the fitting soundtrack, some hilarious moments, Tarantino's fine touches all make this a highly original, quite bloody, vampire adventure. If you are a genre fan don't miss it, if you are not you might give it a try and be pleasantly surprised."", 'George Clooney should have stuck will this kind of role. He did fine in Out of Sight and Ocean\'s Eleven, but he really dominated this movie with a fury that we may never see again. Almost every line he delivers is memorable and that is not all Tarantino\'s doing. The rest of the cast is dominated by cool cameos and veteran cult and mainstream names. The exception being Ernest Liu who does a good job of holding his own. No Tarantino film would be complete without a good soundtrack. This one, as with Desperado, features songs by Tito and Tarantula. Although I have only heard four songs by them, I consider them one of my favorites. I will never forget what my parents told me after they watched this without me. ""You sure can pick \'em,"" my mother blurted with distain. Do not make my mistake, watch it with your parents to see them squirm.', ""A terrific build up and then .... wham a 180 degree plot twist that really sucks. It's a lost opportunity with such an excellent cast. Still it is entertaining and Salma Hayek is smoking hot!!!"", ""I remember when I first saw this movie, the first hour was awesome, amazing, I was interested, involved, and wanting more. Then everyone turned into vampires and it became an entirely different movie. It was like they took a really good drama/action movie, and combined it with a horrible B horror movie. It literally was like watching two different movies, one that was great, and one that was just plain awful, and they just happened to have the same characters, and both be about an hour long. I wish they had just stuck with the first movie, instead of seeming to say ,after writing about half, you know what would be cool, a movie about vampires that live in a Mayan temple, hey I know let's just turn this movie into that one, yeah... Awful!"", 'In 1960, Alfred Hitchcock did something unthinkable in the film ""Psycho"". Halfway into the movie he killed off the main character (and the film\'s biggest star), thereby shocking the audience through sheer unpredictability while simultaneously changing the expected course of the narrative. A similar trick is employed in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (although the two films are nothing alike). For the first half the film is a kinetic crime thriller, characterised by writer Quentin Tarantino\'s trademark witty, hard-boiled dialogue and a clutch of well delineated characters. At the halfway point, the film suddenly switches to become an ultra-gory, ultra-violent vampire movie, almost a hyperactive homage to ""Night Of The Living Dead""! It is a jarring switch";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Along the way he picks up the slow-witted brother (Robert Pattinson) of one of the thieves. Dystopian future or post-apocalyptic movies kind of blend together after you've seen a lot of them. So when one comes along that feels fresh like this one, it deserves praise for that alone. The acting is excellent. Guy Pearce has long been an actor whose work I enjoy but the big surprise here is Robert Pattinson, who ensures with this performance that he will be remembered for more than the Twilight movies. Taut direction with quality acting, writing, and music. It's a good movie but not for everybody. Dark, gritty, often slow and certainly violent. But it's also very rewarding if you're wiling to give it a chance."", ""The Rover is an anti-blockbuster mainly because of its rhythm : it is very slow, therefore preventing many people to stick to it while watching it. What you get here is not some amusement but rather gives material to think. We're not escaping from existence, like with e.g. Gravity, Hunger Games or whatever acclaimed propaganda. And it is quite disturbing as the more we go on watching the movie, the more we confront with some reflections about our time : there's no more gods, no more laws and we're getting increasingly isolated. Just the gruesome reality. People are striving to survive and protect what is theirs (always material things), though remains some hints of optimism - and Pattinson is playing quite well on this regard."", ""Starts off as a revenge piece about a man losing his car to some thugs in the middle of an unforgiving harsh land. He forms an unexpected allegiance with the somewhat simple minded brother of one of the villains.From here it turns into a road movie of sorts, as the two navigate the perils of the wasteland they're in trying to find his car.The scenery is undoutedly great to watch, but excessive use of it make the pace lagg a bit. Also there is a lot of scentences being repeated or plain staring into the distance long periods of time, which gets a bit annoying.Have to say that the performances of most the actors is quite good, taking into account the scope of the film. Guy Pearce does a good job as the ruthless avenger. Robert Pattinson also ok as the half-wit sidekick.There could maybe have been more nuances to the main character which would have made it easier to understand his violent actions. As it was, large portions of the film you didn't have anyone to root for.The ending worked for me at least to some degree, which in small part made up for the undeveloped storyline."", ""It starts grim, it ends grim. The locations are beautifully photographed, and the minimalist score helps convey the bleakness and isolation of the piece. Guy Pearce growls intensely through his brief bouts of dialogue as Eric, and Robert Pattinson is effective as slow-minded Rey.It is all very one note. When grimness is all there is, and there's no lightness or shocks to break it up, the film becomes sadly dull. I found myself drifting away quite often, and I wasn't given the impression I missed anything.Others liked this, and that's great";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They were able to eliminate the last Deviant 500 years ago and have been waiting to go home ever since.This is a reach for the MCU franchise. I like the audacity but there are issues with the execution. I do like the style and the visual but I find the characters hard to connect with. They are god-like creatures trying to pass as humans. There is something compelling in that but the characters never fully find their human level. There is barrier to these characters that the film is unable to breach. In addition, Angelina Jolie is too distracting in this role. I like Gemma Chan but maybe she should play Thena. Sersi needs an ingenue with star power. In the end, this is a tougher premise to execute than most and the film struggles to give it a human scale.', ""Not really sure why this movie got so much hate. It's introducing a swath of new superhero's and doesn't really converge with any other Avengers plot lines save for a few mentions of Thanos, Thor and some other hero's. That job on its own isn't an easy one and I think they did a fantastic job of giving us a new storyline. The shear scale of the movie was well done both in terms of time periods and in general how epic and massive everything felt. Loved the diversity of the characters - every one of them added something to the story. With that being said - and this is coming from just your average Marvel fan with no knowledge of the comics - the Eternals powers all seemed a bit underwhelming. Maybe it's just that they were trying to display how powerful the deviants were but even Ikaris couldn't take down one on his own. Other than that the movie was absolutely beautifully shot - maybe the best looking Marvel movie to date. Again, I'm not sure what the hate is about but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it."", 'Is this the best MCU movie yet? Not by a long shot. But they manage to establish the Eternals, Celestial, Eros, Black Knight, and Blade and still make it work.', 'I think this movie got such a trash review because people thought it was too ""woke"" with casting. Which is nonsense by the way. That is how the real world is. It does have its flaws but it\'s not nearly as bad as people rate it. These 2 & 3 ratings are nonsense. Those people who wrote those might want to try watching movies from a long ways back were they did put out some good movies but also put out tons of trash. This is most certainly not trash. It\'s pretty good. Decent humor, good action and a good story. Pacing and some of the dialogue is subpar. I will Also say that its run time is a bit much. I actually enjoyed this movie though and I\'m very much not disappointed or think that it was a waste of time. It\'s a very unique take on the internals. I will say that Sercy and Icarus chemistry could\'ve been better. It has its flaws but if you want to sit back and watch a unique interpretation of a comic book Then give it a shot.', ""I like it since the beginning of the story. It's been cool to see eternals through the ages, but the past-to-present contrast isn't that smooth. The characters are cool and their powers are awesome, but it's frustrating in some scenes. But overall, it's actually a good movie, so it shouldn't be underestimated like that, the scale is big, it's epic, the visual work is very beautiful, very spectacular, want to see it again to enjoy the visual work."", ""Chloé Zhao's direction gives Marvel Cinematic Universe a much needed breath of fresh air, but 'Eternals' doesn't quite come together. Despite the fact the film claims to have a far more thought-provoking theme and a plethora of philosophical concepts, it fails to elaborate on them sufficiently to create a more compelling experience. The movie is still magnificent to look but it's pretty much lifeless with boring actors playing boring characters."", ""Shang-Chi gave me hope for Phase 4 of Marvel. Eternals dashed those hopes. This is probably my least favorite Marvel movie. This film is too long and crammed full of overly complicated plot points, yet it's also completely predictable. It seems the filmmakers were too busy trying to check off boxes rather than create a good story. It's also a downer. People watch MCU movies to have fun, not to have existential crises. Perhaps the Eternals should have stood on the sidelines a little longer."", ""I had a good time watching Eternals. It wasn't the best film I've seen, but I have a lot of respect for the effort to make this.Eternals has the humor, top-notch special effects, and references that make it an MCU movie.The notes that worked in this film are the humor, VFX, stunning visuals, and fight scenes. The notes I think need improvement are the character development, the runtime, and understanding of character motivations."", ""It was a great movie overall.Not a typical, colorful MCU movie but good visuals nonetheless. A little too much CGI and VFX but I guess they are eternal so that makes sense i suppose.Had love-hate relationship with lots of characters, mainly Druig.Love a little bit of Bollywood mashup in the movie and funny side character Karun.Looks like MCU is taking a new shape and the new villain is wayyy wayyy wayyyyyyyyy too big (shape, size and power). If i'm not mistaken, the celestial being formed a black hole towards the end, that should tell how powerful it is.Overall, loved it. Will watch it again soon. Not Shang-Chi good, but not Thor: Dark World bad.Giving it a 7 out of 10."", 'The movie goes more into the origins of the eternals and gives you an insight into each of their personalities. Don\'t go in expecting an all out established set of characters kicking ass from start to finish. The story is fairly well told but I must admit that it does lack some action but the action you do get is very well done and visually stunning, especially those that feature Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Makkari the speedster. It is hard to see how these characters will have a future intertwined with the rest of the MCU stories but it does day ""the eternals will return..."" at the end.', ""Ok but how are they speaking english since they are before the time when english language was spoken? I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The amount of plot holes and wasted potential was really annoying and Sersei had 0 personality. The visuals were amazing but it doesn't make up for the lack of logic put into the movie. The powers were so inconsistent and the prime eternal was just wasted after not even putting up a fight. The deviants were wasted as well and the celestials not telling the eternals why they're on the planet made no sense. Just so many reasons to dislike the execution of the movie. This was a lame movie, there is always a useless hero in every show and Thena was this movies useless hero... How tf you let your man die right in front of you. Thanos IS a Deviant-Eternal. So where's the logic. This movie was completely overrated i'm sorry. This film was the worst mcu film. So boring and the plot was all over the place."", ""I don't know why so many people gave it slack.

However, the build up of the film is just too slow and too long, and I lost most of my interest and concentration when the final showdown begins. In addition, the one liner jokes are a little out of place and quite contrived.

The acting in ""LIFT"" is simple and fitting for the genre. The villain\'s role, while episodic, lacks complex scripting or depth. The plot is quite straightforward, lacking the intricacies and captivating scenes that often define heist movies.The film is good for a casual evening watch but doesn\'t have the rewatchability factor. The actors perform pleasantly, and while it incorporates comedy, the number of jokes is limited, and they\'re sprinkled throughout a basic script. The simplicity of the storyline means it\'s devoid of cunning twists or complexity.The ending of ""LIFT"" is satisfying, bringing a sense of justice as those who were wronged find a way to get back at their deceivers.

This movie indeed came out too early.This movie not only shows us the pictures. But also the people behind them.\nWhat I love about Watchmen is that it\'s mature and basic study of how our society is structured. There\'s so many quotes that can be used in todays world. And with Zack Snyders visuals. It really blends well.I gotta say. People calling this movie ""boring"" are the ones watching 4 movies a year. And they\'re all action heavy blockbusters.', 'Some time after ""The Boys"" I decided to give this film a rematch... Back in 2009 it was still a time when there was not that many similar to each other superhero films Watchmen cam out a bit too early..., What makes Watchmen feeling so fresh in 2020 is that it\'s completely different to most of Marvel films.... The characters in Watchmen feel more like real people than idealistic figures you usually get - they age, they change opinions on things, they do wrong things... The world is also much more similar to ours in 2020 that it was in 2009... Brilliant film 9/10!', ""This kind of movie is one that I would normally ignore. My tastes don't go to these big budget special effects things, but it was available and I had heard my son talk about it. It took me a while to get the idea. I don't read graphic novels and so I had to educate myself concerning the characters. Over time I began to realize that this is a telling of history as if it had gone a different direction during the Nixon era. The world changed and not for the better. Superheroes who could only help on a limited basis have been kept from their task and retired into relative obscurity. Everything picks up when a character called the Comedian is killed (and that takes some doing). I was really impressed by the world created and by how these figures (who are really multi-dimensional) start to interact. There are both cosmic and societal forces that are linked and the governments of the big countries have no idea what is going on. That includes Nixon and Kissinger who are odd to look at, especially with that putty ski jump nose of Nixon's. All in all, it works very well and has a lot of suspense and a very satisfying conclusion. At first I thought it was way too long, but I soon came to realize that the complexities of the social milieu and the number of characters, as well as the need to use flashback to show us where these people had been in the past, made it necessary. While it is incredibly violent and unsettling, it's worth the effort."", ""I thought this movie was just OK when it came out in 2009. Now watching it in 2023 I am watching this movie realizing I was an idiot in 2009. I see the Boys and almost every comic movie since in it in 2023. They've all pulled something from Watchmen. Superheroes with real people problems that have real opinions negative and positive doing both good and bad things all the time. It's great and I'm finally seeing what those that got back in 2009 that were way ahead of the curve. Acting, camerawork, effects, costumes, story, nostalgia, all put on full display in this movie. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jackie Earle Haley put on a show in a movie that I felt like everyone was exceptional. That's how good they are. Give this another go if you're somehow here reading this debating on whether you should watch this movie."", ""After 14 years I watched this film again. And after all the MCU shenanigans, I gotta say this film is a masterpiece, from the story to the music and the super heroes. The fact that they are vulnerable makes it more interesting.Like I said in the tittle, the world wasn't ready for this movie, if it had came out in this time it would've blown the front door. The way it was made, special effects, graphic fight scenes, nudity, dark tone and soundtrack, Zack Snyder really knocked it out of the park with this one. This is how every super hero film should be made. Not a blockbuster comedy wanna be.For a super hero film, a true 10/10 in my book!"", 'The times did change.\nAfter so many super hero movies this one has become the best one of them.', 'I recently saw a free (oh yes) early showing of Watchmen and have to say that it was very good. There have been few movies that I have been this excited for. Some disappointed horribly (Spiderman 3), and some far exceeded my expectations (Dark Knight). This movie falls somewhere in between, leaning closer to exceeded what I thought was going to be a hard book to turn into a movie.The first half of the film is extremely accurate to the book and very well done. While there are some differences from the book (for example, Dan Dreiberg goes to warn Viedt about the ""masked killer"", not Rorschach) but almost all of them are excusable and didn\'t effect the flow of the movie or my ability to enjoy it. Even as far as dialog goes, the movie stays true to the book. Towards the middle, some of the differences begin to effect the film. The best example I can think of is how Dr. Manhattan acts during his live interview (I\'ll restrain from giving away any scenes). Not only did the course of events change from the book (which I can understand, given there must be some sort of time limit for a film), but some of what he says was pretty much copy and pasted from other scenes in the book. Nevertheless, I was able to oversee these differences and enjoy the film.The ending of the movie was the biggest change from the book that I noticed. I think they did this for 2 reasons. 1, I had heard that they were going to include an aspect of energy and where we get it into the film, making it more topical. Secondly, I think the ending of the book would have been too out there for most viewers and would have required a lot more explaining (which the book gives) then would have been feasible for the length of the film (it was about 2 and a half hours long). I think if you have read the book, you will enjoy the movie. You\'ll probably spend a lot of time making sure the movie stays true to the book (like I did), but then you\'ll stop and just enjoy it for being a good movie. I think if you haven\'t read the book, you might enjoy the movie even more. As most readers know, it is unlike any comic book and actually answers the question, what would the world be like with superheroes? We see even the ones we like have dark sides and the ones we don\'t have the best intentions. On a closing note, there are some things I would have changed, had I been to art school and had a gazillion dollar budget for a movie of this magnitude. For one, I think making Dr. Manhattan appear nude, while keeping true to the book, takes away from the movie. I heard a lot of snickers whenever you could see his penis, and I even think they may have showed it more than they do in the book (if you\'ve read the book, take note of the scene were Rorschach comes to visit him and Laurie). I think while it was done with good intentions, covering him up would have been acceptable and not have changed anything about the movie. Also, while I really enjoyed 300 and all the fight scenes in it, the style of slowing down a punch or kick and then speeding it up to real time, I felt, didn\'t work for this movie and sort of made it seem corny. 300 the book is written like a comic book. Watchmen isn\'t. The fight scenes, as gritty as they were, still felt like I as watching 300 again. Besides these small points, I thought the movie was awesome and I recommend it to reader and non- reader of Watchmen alike.', ""I watched it again after ten years because I didn't remember it at all. It is nicely done, it is getting nicely set up through the first half only to end up like any other superhero movie, caricature villain, not convincing at all about the utopia he wants to build. Veidt gets no character development and the actor did not do a good job at all. Silk spectre is also very bad and I found it hard to not cringe most of the times she or Veidt were on screen. Especially after watching the series you can see what the movie could do but instead it's just wasted potential. The movie left you no room to really wonder about the things the way the comic or the series did. Could have been better, should have been better."", ""I have never read any comic or graphic novel, yet I have been able to enjoy quite a few movies that were derived from them. This was certainly not the case for Watchmen. Half way through I was left wondering when the good stuff would finally start coming.Maybe you might have some pre-existing attachment to the characters if you have read the books, but if the movie is all you have, the characters are one-dimensional, dull and unattractive. The Comedian is the only one I loved straight away but he dies within 5 minutes. Rorschach is the next best thing but doesn't get enough focus to really capture my heart. The way he is discarded at the end, made me wonder if really he was of any importance. The strength of his character is too strongly diluted by the bad scenes of the Silk Spectre II and Nite Owl II that continuously interrupt the flow. Silk Spectre II was horrible. She seems to have no emotions whatsoever. All she does is have sex with the guys without too much of a pause between them. The fact that the Comedian is her father might have been expected to give her more depth but hardly seems to faze her. Instead the 5 seconds of poorly acted sobbing followed by immediate reconciliation makes it seem like it's no big deal whatsoever. Nite Owl II is a geek devoid of passion and lacking a backbone. He's the kind of classmate who's name you wouldn't remember after 1 year. Dr. Manhattan serves no purpose other than being the eventual deus ex machina that solves everything, making the efforts of all the other heroes look totally stupid and pedestrian. He's disconnected from the world and is typically not the kind of character a viewer would connect with. The bad guy, Ozzy, gets hardly any background or an explanation why he's both smarter than everyone and able to beat up on the Comedian, Nite Owl II, Rorschach and the Silk Spectre II. Or why he can catch speeding bullets... The movie spends a whole lot of time on flashbacks that take out the whole momentum of the plot. Yet, despite all those flashbacks, it does not manage to make me feel connected to any of the characters. This is the main weakness to me.The songs were nice individually but many times seemed wrong for the scene. It's one of the first times the soundtrack really bothered me in a movie, which says a lot. The CGI was too obvious and in some cases obnoxious and overdone, giving no serious added value. Of course they were breathtaking at times but they were awful at other times. I was looking for a dark movie with corrupted morals and realistic heroes who are not perfect. Only Rorschach brings this to the movie. Slow motion fight scenes, open-bone fractures and blood splattering around just made me sigh. There was no x-factor in any of this. No Sin City effect, no 300 adrenaline pace, no Dark Knight madness, nothing. Part of the reason why so many of the fight scenes couldn't interest me is because they occur in subplots or suddenly pop up in the main plot unexpected.As a movie, it failed for me. This says nothing about the graphic novel, which I might one day buy to find out what the characters are really about. They sacrificed momentum and continuity in the main plot to narrate partial backgrounds on too many characters. Often times it's hard to connect your audience to 1 or 2 characters. If you're trying to make them care about 5 or 6 of them, you're bound to fail, especially with mediocre or boring acting. This is why it was probably a hard task to make a movie from this graphic novel."", ""One of the deepest most sophisticated nuanced super hero movies ever. Production quality is amazing. The story is complex and long but worth the payoff. The acting is great overall. The hero's are vulnerable in so many ways. For every ability they have they suffer from even worse flaws. This is an alternate universe that forks from historical events. Rorschach is my favorite anti hero of all time and the end for me is an emotional powerful climax thats always a gut punch. Soundtrack is spot on. Should have won an Oscar or at least a nomination for any number of categories imo. Genre changing idea as profound and well crafted as the first matrix by comparison. Wouldn't be surprised if the MCU borrowed many ideas from this epic. I have no history with this franchise as a graphic novel and can only judge as a fan of the movie."", 'A complex movie with some of the most human characters that i have ever seen and a villain that is also the hero.Tones a bit dark, almost realistic for a superhero movie but it works.', 'The new Zach Snyder film 100% did not live up to my expectations. Before seeing this film I made sure that I would not compare this move to the graphic novel because I knew that no movie could ever live up to such a predecessor. Based strictly on the film it was only mediocre. I was a fan of Zach Snyder\'s ""300"" but that same style just didn\'t seem to fit into the equation if the ""Watchmen"" universe. The movie is full of slow motion effects and random fight scenes. Any scenes that were trying to be presented as serious did not pan out well. The acting was horrible with the exception of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. The story did not flow in movie form and was very out of place and did not leave me craving for more. The biggest problem to me was how unrealistic the movie seemed. I do not intend to compare this movie to ""Dark Knight"" but that movie set a new standards to superhero movies. ""Dark Knight"" felt like something like that can happen in real life. ""Watchmen"" felt unrealistic and simply mediocre. It was like watching a boring slow-motion action film with a lot of frontal male nudity.6 stars out of 10.', 'Zack Snyder did an amazing job with this movie. The cast was great and so was the story. Also this movie has some beautiful shots. Zack Snyder did a fantastic job!', ""After months of anticipation, today I was fortunate enough to be able to attend the premiere of Watchmen over here. Together with a friend, who hasn't read the book, we went to Amsterdam this afternoon. Expectations were ridiculously high and I was kinda afraid to leave disappointed, since I wasn't sure how to possibly film the book that people refer to as not filmable. Zack Snyder appears to have been the right choice to take the job. 300 proved that he has an eye for visuals and knows how to adept a book as faithful to its source as possible, but faithfulness and nice pictures don't necessarily make for a good movie. In order to achieve this he was forced to cut several sub-plots and trim sequences now and then. He made some very smart moves here though, by making up with detail. Every single frame will please fans with in-jokes, or hints at related characters or plots that the unfamiliar moviegoer won't miss. This gives Watchmen the very much needed depth and heart that fans so very much craved for. The overall story is an exact replica from the book, with every single flashback in place and only 1 noticeable change towards the ending. Much discussed by fans, but I'm sure that only the very worst nitpickers or haters might think badly of this. It works perfectly well, so rest assured, it won't disappoint. The movie begins, like the novel, with the Comedian being killed in a long, tense and action-packed scene that sets the proper mood and makes one long for more, which we get plenty of the next 160 minutes. After this scene comes the brilliant intro montage (with 'The Times They Are A-Changin' in the background), which introduces the Minutemen and helps newcomers to pick up on the story. Everything that comes after this is in one word overwhelming. Every character is well cast, takes complete hold of your attention and gets the time for a proper and detailed introduction. After watching it, it's hard to tell which hero I liked best. Patrick Wilson is perfect as Dan Dreiberg, Rorschach a joy to watch and you're watching Dr. Manhatting in awe, which makes sense for his character. Also, I'm sure everyone will secretly fall in love with Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman). The suits have been beautifully changed wherever necessary and also have the right effect. The Minutemen look kinda stupid, which is perfect for the superhero parody element of the book. But not only the heroes impress, the fans will have a splendid time recognizing all the smaller characters, such as the news-vendor and the reading kid, or the shrink with his pills. Although Snyder adapted the book from scene to scene, there are not only passages he had to make shorter, but also those he slightly enhanced. Fights are longer";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There was promise at the beginning with a great opening introducing us to the anti-heroes which was awesome. And then.... Nothing? Stranded such a talented cast fighting comical looking goons and an anti-climax of a villian. The two stars are for Viola Davis and Margot Robbie who give their roles everything. Every other character is disposable and forgettable. And Jared Leto as the Joker? Lets say no more.', 'My god, that was AWFUL. Just random made-for-trailer tiny scenes that add to nothing, have zero depth and don\'t make up a coherent plot. Wall-to-wall inappropriate songs that come at random times. Boring plot (if you can even call it that), boring and indistinguishable flat characters. Harley Quinn was annoying. Jared Leto did his best as The Joker but had absolutely nothing to work with - he just appears at random times for a few seconds and disappears. There\'s no depth and no story. If you\'ve seen the trailers, you basically saw all the one-liners and ""money shots"".If all that isn\'t enough, the last third of the movie is simply unwatchable.I don\'t think David Ayer is a bad director (I liked HARSH TIMES and FURY), but this is definitely his worst movie yet and I\'m pretty sure it\'s due to massive pressure from the producers.', 'Disappointment. That\'s actually far better than what I felt after watching this movie. I wanted to leave the cinema about 30 minutes before the end but that\'s against my personal policy so I tried plan B but found nothing to poke my eyes out so I watched, and cried...-First, where is Deadshot? No, because all I saw from start to end is goody Will Smith playing the good family guy, very far from the cold hearted hired assassin he is supposed to play.-Second, what was that false publicity? The Joker appeared a lot in the trailer but he has absolutely no purpose in this movie apart from being the background story of Harley Quinn. Really, you remove him, you get the same movie but with only half of the theatre full.-Third, while I\'m on her, the guys who made this movie obviously didn\'t get the relationship between Harley and the Joker. The Joker don\'t give a damn about her, she is his tool, he can throw her from a bridge without a second thought while Harley has developed a serious Stockholm Syndrome toward him. In this movie they are all lovey-dovey, at the end of the movie I nearly expected to see them leave in a car with ""Just Married"" written on the back with a ""And they lived happily ever after.""-The first half of the movie is actually not that bad, the villains really look and act like villains most of the time but everything started to fall apart after Will Smith reunite his troops after they failed the mission the first time, each one of them just want to drop everything and leave but then Will Smith says they can\'t give up and of course all the bad guys listen to him because he is Will Smith (God?). That was when I did my first face-palm.-This movie is 50% Will Smith, 40% Harley Quinn, and 10% the others. Really, apart from the first two, the others are just background characters, to make a comparison, in Guardian of the galaxy, you got one hero but you know the background stories of every members of the team, and they get their fair share of screen time. In this movie, they just don\'t care.-The jokes, sorry... The ""jokes"", well, I think the quotes speaks for themselves. Sometimes it\'s funny, most of the times it\'s not and sometimes they even try to explain the joke you understand but don\'t find funny. I think Warner tried to be more funny and less dark in this movie after they got some bad reviews about Batman Vs Superman being too dark but that\'s just ridiculous, they remade some scenes to add jokes and sometimes it even breaks the action.-And while I\'m on it, Batman vs Superman had an impact in the DC Universe, it starts with the consequences of what happened in Man of Steel and at the end of it, the world has changed. In this movie, there is no progression of the DC Universe, it feels more like one of those filler episode you don\'t want to watch in any series.-I won\'t talk about the end of this movie because, as a sadist, I want you to go watch this movie and suffer during the two hours needed to finally reach the end credits. Just know that the last minutes are actually way worse than the rest of the movie. Enjoy ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Mind you, I have actually done just that, but even then with the amount of time that had passed since I watched the other things it was still a little tricky understanding what was happening.Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people, but also attempting to punish Captain Marvel for what she had done to her people. Yeah, as it turned out, when she destroyed the great intelligence it sent the Kree into a massive civil war which basically destroyed their planet.So, if you had seen Miss Marvel, you will know that she has a thing for Captain Marvel, and of course it was always going to be a thing that she was eventually going to be involved in a team up. Also, there were some hints at the end that suggested that there was going to be another team-up film, though apparently that will still be some way off (and the problem will be that, no doubt, when they get around to it, all of them will be too old to be members of a possible Young Avengers - kids do grow up a little too fast).Yeah, I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on. Oh, it also seemed that it felt that it was a bit over the place, no doubt because they wanted to make the film shorter than a lot of the others. Still, it's good, especially if you are up to date on the films."", ""Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly."", ""I really enjoyed this movie it better than a lot of the recent superhero movies in that i didn't start gaming halfway through. Sure there's some clunky dialogue in the last 20 minutes but overall I would watch again. I noticed some were moaning about Miss Marvel being juvenile but that's the point of her she's a teenager. My only eye roll came with the Bollywood world but even that wasn't awful it just felt a bit too unbelievable. Don't be put off by the reviews give it a spin and try and go in without prejudging it I nearly didn't and nearly missed an enjoyable couple of hours so grab a bag of popcorn and enjoy the movie."", ""The movie was somewhat ridiculous, but I found myself giggling throughout it. It was actually quite fun. There were a lot of really charming things about this movie, and while the storyline lacked any real tension, I didn't really care. It was mostly about the character development, and the relationships between the three main characters. Overall, I just found it really fun and just didn't take it very seriously. In a lot of ways, it is a set up for the rest of the series, and is definitely not a standalone movie. And the post credit scene, amazing. Ties in a lot of potential for what they are going to be doing in this franchise."", ""So I believe the movie is unfairly treated and that included me as well. The trailers don't do this movie much justice and the marketing was also poor. Watching it on Disney made me realize I missed out on a good movie with lot of fun moments in the theater. Some portions needed work but overall the movie has a fun tone and good character list.So the plot is very simple and not too interesting. But that's a good thing. They just wanted to bring multiple characters with similar powers together. The villains motive at first seem simple but with complex reasoning. I believe this movie would have performed well if given better promos and more emphasis on the characters."", '""The Marvels"" is the sequel to 2019\'s ""Captain Marvel"", a continuation of the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of ""Captain Marvel"", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It\'s becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through ""The Marvels"", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU\'s future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be ""apathetic"", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn\'t help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original ""Captain Marvel"" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It\'s also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers\'s humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn\'t help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original ""Captain Marvel"" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You\'d expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I\'m not sure whether it\'s Brie Larson\'s underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won\'t be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau\'s contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris\'s performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers\'s orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I\'m afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naiveté made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan\'s human traits from the Disney+ series ""Ms. Marvel"", being that she\'s still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as ""The Marvels"" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn\'t enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people\'s decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series\' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film\'s failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10.', ""Overall I enjoyed the movie and found it a decent watch enjoyable superhero entertainer movie and compared to what the haters and critics were slamming on the movie for no reason. The three main cast of the movie are the highlight and their bonding is superb.I just couldn't take my eyes away from Brie Larson because she looked absolutely beautiful and stunning throughout the movie and her in the princess looks just stole my heart, Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan (Ms Marvel) is by far the best portayed character ever and she does a great job once again doing that character well. Teyonah Parris as Monica Delivers a great performance too and also portays that role well too. The main three cast performance is top notch and so is the rest of the cast. Der Bernn being portayed by Zawe Ashton as the main antagonist of the movie does great by delivering a good performance too. The last action sequence fight by the three main cast joining together was great and was a well choregraphed action sequence which I found good.Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury once again deliveres a great performance too portraying the character very well.Overall The Marvels is a good decent enjoyable movie that may not be too perfect at its best but it's still good.A 7/10 for the movie."", '2019\'s ""Captain Marvel"" wasn\'t too bad, for a superhero movie, but its sequel ""The Marvels"" is an unmitigated stinking disaster - the WORST Marvel movie to date (which is saying something). Set a decade or two after the original, Brie Larson (via Samuel L Jackson) teams somewhat inadvertently with Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani (awful) to save Gary Lewis\' people (what happened to previous leader Ben Mendelsohn?!) from evil Zawe Ashton. Director Nia DaCosta (who also co-wrote this tripe with Megan McDonnell & Elissa Karasik) creates a headache inducing, fast (as if bizarrely sped up), frantic, thoroughly annoying, tiresome piece of garbage. Absolutely dreadful.', ""I didn't get around to seeing it in theaters. I just watched it on Disney+ now that it's available and it wasn't terrible at all.Sure, it was more childish at times (following the theme of the show that includes the same child main character), but over all it was just a more goofy, fun movie. And it still had some great fight scenes. I think edge lords have gotten so used to the dark grittiness of some of the movies and forgot how to just enjoy movies. I gave up on taking these movies seriously a long time ago. Yes, it's not up to the standard of the early MCU, but it's never going to get back to that - if you're going to compare sequels to the same standard as originals (in any genre) you're just asking for disappointment. If you've got Disney+, there's nothing to lose."", 'This is a fun movie, it ties two TV shows into the lore and does a good job of having fun.Does it add anything to the overall Narative, no!Does it highight Ms Marvel as a fun addition, hell yes.

Brie Larson's acting was not robotic like the first movie. This movie was far better than the most recent Thor movie and all the other recent Marvel movies or shows (except for TGOTG 3!)

Superb movie n excellent acting by all actor/actress.', 'Leaving the purported discussions regarding political agendas and propagandas aside, I believe we can all agree on the fact that the abrogation of ""Article 370"" was a landmark in our nation\'s post-independence history.And for a movie to depict every detail about the article, every residue of the said bill, and every strategy that went behind before the final reveal was no mean feat, yet the makers were able to not only feed information in layman\'s terms but also make the entire proceedings enough interesting to keep the audience engaged for the whole two and a half hours duration.Not to mention, Yami Gautam, as Zooni Haksar, merits commendation. Lately, she has been choosing meatier roles, and I couldn\'t be happier, as she tends to shine whenever she\'s given the spotlight, such a bankable performer she had evolved into.', ""I had always a gut feeling that this movie will tell a great story to every Indian. This movie is full of goosebump moments - the moments tell us about what progress and what collectively we have achieved as a nation.

Shameful...shameful..."", ""I can't call this movie good. I yawned my way through the first half and when it finally started telling a story in the second half, I hated the story they told. I shouldn't be surprised from what they did in the previous movies though.I just wish they respected the history of the movies and didn't try so hard to outdo everything that came before."", ""Giving a movie 1/10 means there was absolutely nothing slightly positive about it which is a complete lie.No it wasn't perfect, but if you just sit back and watch rather than spend the 2 hours nitpicking for flaws you will feel it was a movie nowhere near as bad as people want you to think it is. It still baffles me how Star Wars fans are so determined to let the world know they hate it so much.If someone reviews movies with only 1/10 or 10/10 then that says all you need to know about them."", 'There are two ways to watch this film. You can read the negative reviews and go in the theater with preconceived notions. Or, what I would suggest, go into the theater with an open mind. The choice is yours.Honestly, it took some time for me to get into the story of this film. I tried getting in the zone, but it didn\'t seem to click. But then, around 30ish minutes into the movie, it clicked. I\'m not saying that the first half hour was bad, I\'m simply saying it was hard to grasp at first. The cinematography was beautiful, the score by John Williams was beautiful, and the story was incredible. It might take time to get in the zone, but when you arrive, it feels like the first time you saw Episode 4. Star Wars.The story is so complex it will take a while, and a few more viewings, for me to completely grasp everything that happened. And that\'s not a bad thing. The story ties the entire saga together. How you may ask? Simple. Emperor Palpatine. From The Phantom Menace to The Rise of Skywalker, Palpatine is the embodiment of the dark side. Be it through his body or those of others. To see Ben Solo and Rey come together to finally defeat Palpatine is simply incredible.""But Rey wasn\'t in the originals or the prequels. So why does she and Ben get to defeat the emperor?"" Rey was created by Palpatine. She\'s his granddaughter. Ben was the son of Leia, who is the son of Anakin who was created by Palpatine. So in the end, Palpatine was defeated by his own corruption. Good always wins. Light Always removes the darkness.Cameos. Boy there were some good ones. Seeing Harrison Ford Return as Han Solo was amazing. Watching Denis Lawson (Name spelled correctly) as Wedge was incredible. Mark Hamill, Hayden Christensen, Samuel L. Jackson, Ewan McGregor, Alec Guinness, Frank Oz, and Liam Neeson reprising their roles through voice acting tied it all together.I liked the movie. There were certainly things I didn\'t like about it. But the thing that tied everything together was the score. John Williams is a musical master. His score in the movie was purely incredible. As George Lucas once said about the prequels, ""It\'s like poetry... It rhymes,"" is a true statement. The music is incredible.Go give the film a shot. If you don\'t like it, that\'s ok. If you do like it, that\'s ok too.', ""Star Wars: Episode IX is, at times, a decent thrill ride, and it provides us with some satisfying moments, but it fails to tell a compelling story. It feels empty. It rushes through a corporate checklist of must-have moments at a chaotic pace. It manages to thrill with epic space battles, but it lacks a soul. There's no creative vision here, no story to tell. The pressure that comes with making a Star Wars movie seems to have shackled the creators, preventing them from doing anything interesting with the film. It's a shame. The Star Wars universe is one of the greatest fictional universes ever created. It should provide fertile ground for many new and interesting stories. If I were Disney I would take a serious look at the creative process for these films. They could probably learn a thing or two from Marvel Studios."", ""Everything in this movie feels bad. From how they shoehorn the Sith Language into C3PO, which according to their own lore, was made by a nine year old. They also try to play with your emotions by making it look like the walking carpet got smoked. I don't like what they did with Palpatine. They took one of the best characters and turned him into a plot device. Rey turns out to be the legendary Mary Sue. Everybody loves her, and she never does anything wrong, and never needs to actually have a hero's journey, because she is SOOOO amazing. I have even seen the Holiday Special, that has a better plot than this movie. I think the new trilogy was a steaming pile of garbage, and this one is the most maggot filled, rotting, festering piece on the whole heap."", ""Let me say this... In no way is The Rise of Skywalker a perfect movie, it has its flaws. But that doesn't change the fact that I loved it. Yes it has tons of fan service. Yes most of the events were predictable. And still... It was everything I want Star Wars to be. Funny, exciting, a bit odd sometimes but with a group of loveable characters at it's core. Say what you will, but I loved Star Wars since I was 6 years old and this new movie just made me feel like a very happy kid again."", ""Not terrible, not perfect. Going into the theatre without paying attention to reviews allowed me to appreciate what the film had to offer. Make your own decisions, don't let someone make them for you."", 'This movie introduced an absurd amount of inconsistencies, to the point where either they purposely reversed the whole point of the first 6 films to slap Lucas and his fans in the face, or they never watched any of the previous films at all. First I\'ll talk about what I liked.The acting, the visuals, the effects, the amount of lightsaber screen time, racial diversity, and obviously John Williams\' score, were outstanding.Here\'s what I didn\'t like:* George Lucas confirmed that Palpatine had died long before Disney, the whole purpose of the first 6 films was that Anakin Skywalker was to grow up and defeat the sith to restore balance, which he did. And then this movie reversed that entirely* No introductory entrance scene from Palpatine, it\'s just thrown into the opening crawl that he\'s still alive....* Rey has healing powers? RIP Qui Gonn and literally everyone that has died in Star Wars up until now* Speaking of healing powers, that exact kind of power is what Anakin had spent most his adult life trying to acquire, everything he\'s done is to obtain more power and knowledge of the dark side, and then boom Rey just has it all of a sudden.... Anakin turned his back on everything he was taught in an effort to acquire healing powers. Rey is just walking around healing basilisks like it\'s nothing. So you don\'t need to turn to the dark side and kill billions of people? Light side jedis can heal all along? Anakin got pranked! Why didn\'t Yoda and Mace have healing powers or even know of its possibility?* The convenience of the whole dagger thing really took me out of the movie, wait whats that dagger thing? 3-PO pls translate. ""it contains the coordinates of the exact place we are searching for!"" hmmmmm that was real freaking convenient wasn\'t it, also why did the dagger exist? Why would Palpatine make it and write exact coordinates on it?* Apparently all it takes to defeat Palpatine is to have two lightsabers instead of one? You don\'t need years of training or wisdom...?... if only Yoda/Mace had known* The fact that Palpatine was able to conceive means he was able to feel love at some point in his life........ did he have a love interest raise the kids? did he raise them? Rey would have been more interesting if she was a ""nobody"", the fact that she\'s a Palpatine just seems forced and lazy* Rey and Kylo have had absolutely no romantic chemistry ever, their relationship is shown as sibling-like. The kiss was awkward, and totally random. But it\'s Disney, so is anyone really surprised by that?* There was no reason for Leia and Kylo to die, why couldn\'t Rey just use her healing powers to stop it from happening?* The back and forth of thinking people are dead and then boom all of a sudden they\'re not dead was exhausting. Chewey is dead! Nope. C3PO is dead! Nope. Kylo is dead! Nope. Rey is dead! Nope. They keep reviving each other until one of them couldn\'t anymore.* A lightsaber is a sacred weapon only to be used by jedis in self defense. It\'s not a flashlight, it\'s not something you lend to your friend, and there were 2 more scenes of throwing them off of cliffs, did they learn nothing from TLJ? In the movie Kylo and Rey both threw their lightsabers to get rid of them because they didn\'t want to keep fighting or killing...... so basically admitting they don\'t have self control? What kind of jedi are they? A lightsaber is not a killing weapon, it\'s for self defense!* The Rey v. Palpatine scene was so boring. Palpatine gets his full strength back, lightnings a whole fleet, and then is defeated in like 7 seconds... by his own lightning.... again* Kylo turns good? Of course he does. There weren\'t a lot of obvious signs of struggle, and honestly that would have been a much better movie if it was just from his perspective, I wanted more Kylo, but he hardly had screen time and had a disappointingly little amount of lines* Why bring back Han, Leia, and Luke just to kill them all off? Having the beloved three back together again is what was going to make the new trilogy so special, but they never got to reunite* The Knights of Ren sucked! Just kind of hung around and then got killed by Pajama-boy Ben all at once in only seconds of fighting* W. T. F. was that final Lando scene? ""Where do you come from? Lets find out""..... Ummm what exactly did you mean by that?* Palpatine has a new giant fleet? Why not just lightspeed something through all of them, because apparently you can do that now...* Episode 8: Leia sends out a signal to all the systems asking for help... literally no one shows up---Episode 9: Lando flies around to all the systems asking for help.... literally everyone shows up. Not an inconsistency I just thought it was humorous, haha!* What did Finn want to tell Rey? They ended the movie before they remembered to answer that. At this point JJ is probably just trolling us by leaving that unanswered* Kylo should have killed Palpatine, to at least be somewhat consistent with ""I will finish what you started""* Where was Anakin? Did he forget how to force ghost himself? Obviously didn\'t care enough about the resistance. Show us Hayden!* Luke\'s lightsaber just duct taped back together and it\'s as good as new?* A lot of this movie\'s purpose had to do with Rey\'s identity. ""Be who you are, Rey""... cut to the end of the movie... ""I\'m Rey Skywalker."" Nope! you literally just learned that you\'re a Palpatine, nice try though* Leia should have died in TLJ... the unused footage was kind of creepy* It\'s pretty obvious that the trilogy wasn\'t planned out, there is no comprehensive storyline. What the trilogy is about is still a mystery to me* The pace of the first 30 minutes was super rapid, and then didn\'t stay consistent, they just kind of pasted scenes together but who cares, it\'s cool if you have a lightsaber out, right?* Poe can\'t catch a break for the 3rd movie in a row, just for comic relief too* In my opinion the best thing about the trilogy and especially ROS was the force connection that Rey and Kylo had, what they were able to do (communicate remotely, transfer objects to help each other, feel what the other is feeling, etc) was really interesting and I loved it. All of that ruined by the stupid meaningless kiss.Surely there will be people that love this movie, and I will never understand how they can look past all the above mentioned.\nRIP Star Wars, sorry you had to end like this.', 'You should probably disregard any review that gives this a 1/10 or a 10/10. It is not a terrible movie, nor is it legendary. For the average movie-goer I suspect it will fall somewhere between 6/10-8/10. Highly enjoyable in terms of visuals and plot twists, but not enough to stick around with you for years to come like the original trilogy.', 'Three movies in to the final part of what is being called the Skywalker Saga and I have to confess: worse than not knowing anything about these new characters -- Poe Dameron, Finn and Rey -- I honestly don\'t care about them. They\'re ciphers that we only know the barest of things about. Why does Finn have such an affinity for his friends? Why should we care a lick about Poe when he\'s proven to be too headstrong and willing to leave people behind, yet has nothing redeeming to make up for it? And Rey has every single skill of the Jedi near-instantly, almost a way too perfect character to be true.Don\'t tell me I have to read the other books or watch the shows or do my research. Don\'t tell me that the old films in the Star Wars saga didn\'t come out as often or perhaps we cared too much about them. I sat -- well, slept, I\'ll be perfectly honest -- through this too loud and too much installment and I have to tell you my most honest review: Yeah, alright.I don\'t go to blockbusters to walk away saying, ""Yeah, alright.""SPOILER WARNINGObviously, everything after this will contain massive spoilers. You have been warned.The first critical error the film makes is by telling us that a secret message has caused a stir in the galaxy: the Emperor is alive. You know, instead of a scroll, perhaps this event -- probably the most important thing that\'s happened in all three of these post Return of the Jedi films, could have been shown to us so we could grasp just how mindblowing it is. Nope. It\'s in words on the screen. The dead speak! This is lazy filmmaking.Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, who isn\'t howling in a bar or eating ass in this one) obtains a Sith Wayfinder device and travels to the planet Exegol, where the Emperor is recharging. It turns out that everything evil in the past few films has come from Palpatine, including Snoke who is just a clone. Snoke is the most infuriating character in these films, another character who really has no motivation and no reason to exist other than being yet another Star Wars villain set up to be an undefeatable villain only to, you know, by cut in half. See: Darth Maul, General Grievous, Count Dooku.So the Emperor does what has never been done before. He just plain conjures up a million or so Star Destroyers on a planet that has constant darkness and lightning. He tells Kylo to find Rey, who is studying to be a Jedi with General Leia Organa Solo (Carrie Fisher), who is more Force-sensitive than a Jedi, you know, until this movie, which has a CGI cut scene that looks like, well, a video game cut scene that shows her training with Luke and realizing that she\'s going to die and not complete her journey but someone else will. Because man, Star Wars is kind of like Catholicism for people who\'d rather have Carlos Casteneda instead of John the Baptist.There\'s also a spy in the First Order, a subplot that changes nothing in the film other than to remind you that General Hux and Ben Solo probably had a tempestuous affair at one point and there\'s a thin line between love and hate.Rey, Poe, Finn, Chewbacca, BB-8 and C-3PO head out for Passanna to meet Lando Calrissian while R2-D2 stays with Leia in a military base. Soon, Kylo Ben Solo and the Knights of Ren show up just as Rey discovers a Sith dagger than C-3PO\'s programming forbids him to read. Why? Is it because he was built by Anakin Skywalker? Nah -- it\'s just another dangling ""We\'re going to kill off another beloved character"" tease and even when they wipe out the golden droid\'s memory, it comes back so quickly and easily, you wonder why they even teased this moment of sadness.I also have no idea why the Knights of Ren are important other than they will make cool looking toys and fat dudes will dress like them and bump into me at conventions.Speaking of teasing the death of a major character -- Rey uses Force Lightning to accidentally kill Chewbacca, who died way back in the book Vector Prime before the books were no longer part of the real Universe. But yeah, Chewbacca survives anyway. Seriously, they should have called this movie Star Wars: Let\'s with Chewbacca. The dude gets tortured, stripped, Rey uses his gun, one of his best friends dies and oh yeah, he had to be in this movie.Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell, who did Alias with J.J. Abrams) is in this too. She\'s a masked smuggler who had something of a relationship at one point with Poe but they never kissed, which is pretty much par for Star Wars romance. She is not Zam Wesell, so don\'t get that confused. Honestly, her scene about wanting to leave behind the planet Kijimi is about as emotionally resonant as this movie gets.Turns out that Chewbacca is still alive, so there\'s a failed rescue mission on a Star Destroyer that leads to a nice scene where Rey and Kylo have a lightsaber battle between their two worlds. That\'s when we learn that Rey is Palpatine\'s granddaughter, who tried to King Herrod her as a child, as he feared her power.So hey, why don\'t we go back to Endor. Do we have to? Yes, we do. That\'s where we meet a whole bunch of other Stormtroopers who got tired of missing every shot and took off their suits and became dudes who ride yaks. Their leader, Jannah, is not Enfys Nest from Solo: A Star Wars Story, despite similar animal mounts and markings. She and Finn quickly become friends but there\'s not even a hint of romance.Also: remember when Rose Tico was such a big deal in the last movie? Yeah, neither do the filmmakers.There\'s a cool scene where the second Death Star is in the giant black waves of Endor and Kylo and Rey have another lightsaber battle. Remember when lightsaber battles were rad and you couldn\'t wait for them, way back before Yoda zipped all around doing backflips and suddenly, you wondered how and why lightsabers could be boring? Yeah.Man, anyways, Leia dies reaching out through the Force to her son, who gets impaled by Rey but then healed by her before she runs to the Emperor\'s world to kill the old man, because you know, that\'s what he wants. He came back from the dead so the child he sent away because he feared she would kill him can kill him. Motivations are super important in Star Wars.Nearly everyone who Hasbro will sell to idiots like me dies. Star Wars has a fetish for hands getting chopped off, British accents, wipe transitions and killing off fat spaceship pilots.Luckily, Rey and Kylo fight back, but then we learn another motivation for the Emperor: he wanted to leech their youth and become strong again. So, if Rey had just killed him, did this second plan even matter? Well, he\'s every Sith and Rey ends up being every Jedi and they battle and she ends up killing him. However, because she turns his Force lightning against him, she isn\'t killing him like he wanted and this killing is OK because Star Wars.We end up back on Tatooine where Rey goes to hide the last two lightsabers and claim the name of Skywalker. Then we see Leia looking like the Virgin Mary and Luke looking like some dude who\'d go to a comic convention to meet Mark Hamill as ghosts.Question: Remember when it was a big deal that Qui-Gon Jinn didn\'t turn into a Force spirit and disappear and we were gonna get answers on that one? Yeah. Well, both Leia -- not a Jedi -- and Kylo Ben Solo disappear when they die. Of course, he kisses Rey first. And his dad shows up and calls back the ""I know"" line because this movie is fan service from frame one, bringing back holo chess when it\'s not sledgehammering plot points and deus ex machina into your feeble brainstem.This movie is a lot like sugary cereal. Sugary cereal is real good, except for how you feel sick after eating multiple bowls.Also: I kind of hate that new green robot D-O who literally talks like a Donald Trump tweet, saying ""Sad!"" when a scene is upsetting. We get it. We know it\'s sad. You don\'t have to tell us.The movie also feels like one that should pause and flash: CHECK THIS OUT! Like the tie-fighter parked next to an x-wing. We get it. We get the symbolism. Or when Wedge Antilles shows up, that kind of stuff is only for dudes like me that knew the names and call signs of every pilot. And yes, Wedge is Red Two. I was also a virgin until well into my twenties, thank you very much.So what did I like about the movie? I dug those yak creatures that they rode on the deck of the Star Destroyers and yes, I know they\'re called orbaks but I\'m going to keep on calling them yaks. And I adored Lando basically picking up Jannah and saying, ""Let\'s find out where you\'re from."" You know he\'s making her crosseyed in the back of the Millennium Falcon right now while Nien Nunb wonders why there\'s a sock on the door. I also liked the little dude named Babu Frik who wiped out C-3PO\'s mind. And I kinda dug the kintsugi look of Kylo Ren\'s new mask.Yeah, it was also nice that we saw the first same sex kiss in Star Wars between Commander D\'acy and an unnamed character that will surely get a name and a Hasbro San Diego Comic-Con two-pack release that will sell for many times the original price on eBay.Look -- I\'m not going to tell you what to like and be a gatekeeper. Love what you love, enjoy what you enjoy and spend your money where you want. That said, I spent a good chunk of my life loving Star Wars and know more about Dengar than many of the extended family members. I know -- and care -- next to nothing about anything in this film. There are people who are going to go see it a few hundred times and get the sugar rush that this film is and love it because it\'s Star Wars. Again, being a fan of the saga is a lot like being Catholic -- you know the motions, you go through them but after a while, you question why you just don\'t feel the same after Mass.', ""It's not George Lucas' vision. The main crew doesn't have the same chemistry has the original one. It has some loose ends...\nThis why it doesn't deserve 10/10.\nIt's the first (on the new trilogy) with a proper original story. TFA was like a remake of ANH and TLJ was a mix of moments of ROTJ and TESB. This one has its own idea, and it's a good one.\nWe can argue about some loose ends, for sure. But the story doesn't fail our expectations, it respects SW heritage and conflicts (the main one, the inner conflict to go down a dark path).\nIt's frantic and has amazing battles, fine light saber duels, it gives Rey a solid background.\nThere is a lot to like.\nForget about most reviews and enjoy!"", ""I'm sick and tried of bad reviews for what isn't a bad movie given by people who only highlight the bad points. It feels like people believe they're entitled to a movie with a story told exactly how they want it and so refuse to enjoy it. The 1 star reviews are not from true Star Wars fans in my opinion.Star Wars storytelling has never been incredible or even that original. The whole sagas story is as old as time, one of good vs evil. Star Wars has always been fun, sometimes dark and entertaining with a clear message of finding hope in the darkest of times. This movie was just that.I'm more than happy with this latest entry from the Galaxy Far Far Away"", ""I don't understand how the story was a mess, I followed it just fine.\nI don't understand how it undoes things from the last movie.\nI don't understand how call backs and fan service is a bad thing, I enjoyed them all and could picture many scenes across the series.\nI watched it a second time last night and still enjoyed it.

I don't hyper analyze.\nThe movie was fun and the story entertaining. Isn't that the point of going to see cinema created for entertainment?"", 'The good:\nCinematography\nMusicThe bad:\nNo storyline. Palpatine came back somehow, was confronted by Rey and died again. It took her less than 2 minutes to finish him in the end all because dead Jedi suddenly decided to talk to her, comfort her she wasn\'t alone.The ugly:\nPoe\'s speech before going into battle reminded me of every medieval movie I can remember. Then, 2 minutes later I saw a bunch of horses running across the deck of a Star Destroyer, freakin HORSES!Rey dies (why??) then Ben resurrects her (how??), they kiss (why??) and then he dies (vanishes), how&why??The RISE of Skywalker?? The 2 last remaining Skywalkers DIE!! There is NO Skywalker left.PLOT-BLACK-HOLESI remember downloading the storyline of all 9 chapters 16 years ago. The final trilogy was supposed to be about Leia & Han\'s kids, Luke\'s kids, a cloned version of Luke, a cloned version of Vader/Anakin and Luke eventually becoming the most powerful Jedi of all time after finally defeating the Sith in their ancient temple. The entire trilogy felt mystic, dark and after reading all 9 chapters the final 3 were undoubtedly going to be a ""save the best for last"" scenario. I am so disappointed. Star Wars is dead. Count me out.', 'I\'ve been reading some of the reviews of this film on idmb. I was pretty taken aback by how many negative reviews there are I mean a LOT if bad reviews a lot of 2 and 3 out of 10! Really? You people thought it was that bad? Well I liked it it\'s definitely the best of the trilogy. While I agree this trilogy has been pretty disappointing, I believe this film stands out. It was a really inventive storyline and the performance of the actors was emotionally charged. Good Acton scenes as well. As far as these really bad reviews, you people seriously need to lighten up you define the phrase ""tough crowd""', 'This movie was vastly better than many of the reviews say. Was it a cinematic masterpiece? No. Was it an enjoyable movie? Yes.', 'A tragic culmination of the flaws of the previous 2 films. Whether due to his own lack of imagination, studio meddling, or the previous abomination that Rian Johnson directed, JJ Abrams has wholly and utterly failed to deliver a satisfying end to this abysmal trilogy.The storyline is a nonsensical mashup of bad original concepts and stolen ideas, the writing itself is hamfisted, and the climax is a laughable double ex-machina. The main plot point of the film is directly lifted from a 1991 comic series call Dark Empire, except the film did it badly. It comes off like a fan fiction story with a hollywood budget.Any praise I could lay upon the actors themselves was wasted by the director and producers. Ultimately this film (and the Trilogy as a whole) is confusing, unsatisfying, anti-climactic, and wildly inconsistent with the original 6 films.', 'Excellent visuals,a good story,a few pacing issues,plot holes but\nOverall a good conclusion to the trilogy\nMust watch', 'So much fun.

Loki was a fun villain ngl. It was when the Avengers first assembled so it's a pretty important movie. Nothing can replace it."", ""This might be controversial to say but this is my personal favorite MCU movie. Up until this point, nothing had been done like this in film and it was executed magnificently. Going into this movie in 2012 (having only seen Iron Man beforehand) I was skeptical and not interested. Then my brother took us to the theater to see it and it was one hell of a blast. I was blown away and wanted to watch all of the other Phase 1 movies and learn more about these other heroes. The casting and chemistry between them is on point, the villain is compelling and gets under your skin in the best way, and Robert Downey Jr.'s humor all around is unforgettable, and how can I not mention that glorifying theme song?? Not to mention Stan Lee's perfect cameo!"", 'Ugh! ""Avengers"" wore me out. Lets begin with this spoilfest review. The character I was most looking forward to being fleshed out was Hawkeye, who starts out as a zombie.... Loki has a good entrance, but his alien-buddies are never fleshed out, named, or given any character development whatsoever. Apparently, their ""advance warfare"" includes just really-drunken aerial driving. Thor was a pure letdown. He had no swagger, wasn\'t boisterous, and his costume changed without rhyme or reason. PLUS, he just *poof* appeared, and this killed the beautiful and tragic unrequited love ending of ""THOR"". PLUS, PLUS, he didn\'t even try to find Jane, or even pound her with a hailstorm or anything! Maria Hill was just annoying eye-candy whose stunning visage countered her lack of plot-points. And Captain America was lackluster. Black Widow was okay. Hulk was funny, but it was kind of creepy how he went after Black Widow. He spends half the movie telling everyone not to bring out the bad guy, then he kind of reveals in the movies silliest moment that, oh, golly gee, I can do this anytime I want to. And Pepper Potts as a daisy-duke wearing penthouse babe? I don\'t think so. The worst continuity of the series fell on Iron Man. At the end of ""The Incredible Hulk"", it was setup where Tony Stark was forming the Avengers, then we find out in ""The Avengers"" that he wouldn\'t even be accepted? No Odin, No Jane, No tender flashback scene for Cap\'s love-interest... I felt the movie really could have benefited from some roller-coaster ride, instead of all peaks. I was surprised to see ""Jenny Agutter"" listed in the credits, apparently she was an unnamed council-member who was so poorly lit she didn\'t stand out. The best part was Agent Coulson who died (wtf?). And who was the rogue pilot who took it upon himself to nuke New York? No hints at future teammates.... No real philosophic underpinnings like X-Men had... It was kind of just DisneyWorld on Crack, but it was fun to see on opening night....', ""I have never reviewed anything here on IMDb but after watching the Avengers for the second time I just felt the need to say something. Very well, after watching the Avengers in the cinema you don't reflect very much of the bad things, it's all special effects and 3D stuff going on. But after watching this alone at home, I just felt it's not that good. The story is cliché as many has mentioned, but I felt that there are a few things that are unclear.I just can't figure out how strong are the asgardians, they are supposedly demi-gods. Still the hulk threw Loki around like nothing, I just felt that scene was unnecessary. I don't want the bad-guy to look so crappy. I just couldn't take Loki seriously he got tossed around a lot. Don't get me wrong I enjoy some of the humor added to this film, it's just sometimes it's not timed right it just seems wrong to me.The most annoying part about The Avengers is that the Bad Guys didn't stand a chance. And I didn't like Loki for being a bad guy again."", 'Have movies become so bad these days that a merely well-executed totally formulaic film, like ""The Avengers,"" is heralded as an exceptional film?Sure, this film hits all the marks and has some good one-liners, but once we expected films to be refreshing and new. ""Star Wars,"" while having obvious flaws, provided us a totally new universe with its own unique political conflicts, worlds, and even its own theology (the force). Its first twenty-minutes is mostly watching the story of a robotic English dandy (C3-P0) argue with a chirping rolling trashcan (R2-D2), but amazingly enough Lucas made that unique and crazy idea entertaining. The plot of ""The Avengers"" is just your run-of-the-mill comic book story-line. Compare its plot to that of ""Inception"" or ""The Matrix"" or even ""Back to the Future"" or ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" Much of what makes those films so great is that their plots are highly innovative. You have no idea where they are going. You always know exactly where ""The Avengers"" is going. Along these same lines, ""Psycho,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""The Matrix,"" etc. provide classic twists--Norman has gone insane and has, in his mind, become his mother, the film\'s apparent killer";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I found the movie to be very good. If you are a fan of the X-Men and/or enjoyed ""Captain America: Civil War"", you will likely enjoy this film.Instead of offering my own review, I am going to respond to the ""top critics"" from Rottentomatoes.com:""It\'s basically a closing chapter to a feeble trilogy that started out pretty well and then ran out of gas... Oscar Isaac wasted in the role of an invulnerable ancient supervillain who becomes vulnerable just in time for the final showdown."" Andrew O\'Hehir (Salon.com) Clearly this critic is biased against the comic, for he refers to it as a ""feeble trilogy"". And if he paid attention (and didn\'t look forward to his scathing review), he would\'ve seen that Apocalypse was not vulnerable, but a ""back door"" access was made to begin defeating him via Jean Grey in his mind (something that wasn\'t possible earlier in the film).""Mutants galore infest ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" but the pile-on quickly becomes wearying....but the storyline, such as it is, would have benefited from major pruning."" Peter Rainer (ChristianScienceMonitor) A pile-on of mutants? There are possible three additional mutants added, with only one being introduced for the first time (Nightcrawler). Inclusion shouldn\'t be an issue, it\'s time taken for backstories that become clutter. And, ""pruning""? This is a very simple story, only the characters are given a little more dimension beyond simple cartoon characters. And my response to Rainer, applies to Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine, as well (""Enough already. Singer throws so much mutant at us that nothing sticks. I was almost rooting for Trump to impose a quota."") Jean Grey, Cyclops, Mystique, Quicksilver, and Nightcrawler, with the last one being the only new character (though, he did appear previously). Mr. Travers, the movie is not called, ""X-Man,"" and per your complaint, like O\'Hehir from Salon.com, it appears you don\'t like this comic series. Well, I could go on, but, you get the point. The story is good -- and not convoluted. The acting is good. And, of course, the directing is good. If you liked the other ""X-Men"" movies, you like this one. And, personally, I found this one better than ""Days of Future Past"", which was a bit convoluted for my taste.', 'This movie\'s all about \'out with the old/in with the new\', starting with James McAvoy taking over Patrick Stewart\'s voiceovering duties. In ancient Egypt, En Sabah Nur\'s old/dried-up body\'s getting the boot as his consciousness is transferred into a new vessel (Oscar Isaac). Evidently, protestors are just as annoying/much of a nuisance back then as they are today, wanting to disrupt the Four Horsemen of the Apolcaypse\'s ceremony as they endeavor to protect their leader...but because they suck, they\'re easily defeated (even whilst possessing neat powers such as folding people like origami). Luckily, good ol\' reliable Death manages to place a protective shield around Smurfpocalypse (after the transfer\'s completed) before he\'s buried underneath rubble until future idiots inevitably revive his blue arse.While some may\'ve loved the journey-through-human-history that makes up this movie\'s opening credits sequence, I myself found it a bit much (everything zips by SO fast you can hardly follow what\'s appearing onscreen). The WTF-ery begins with a young Angel (no, not the dragonfly-winged-one-played-by-Zoë Kravitz...she *dead*, remember? The *other* one) CAGEFIGHTING young Nightcrawler (yes, REALLY. I guess DoFP\'s timey-wimeyness is to blame for why Angel\'s completely different to The Last Stand\'s version) until human-looking Raven/Mystique (clearly J-Law renegotiated her contract to have her appearing in blue scaled back), wearing a booby purple dress, liberates her fellow blue mutant after Angel\'s wings get singed.Unlike her First Class introduction, Moira MacTaggert\'s (returning so the issue of Charles wiping her memory can *finally* be addressed) the MOST-clothed she can possibly be as she witnesses worshippers revive Smurfpocalypse (told ya!), causing an earthquake everywhere, which leads to Erik/Magneto (who\'s laying low/living regular-person life with a boring wife and kid) saving a colleague at work by using his power...and soon the cops are after him. In a scene mirroring his own separation from his parents, Erik\'s daughter displays her power (summoning birds to attack). His obviously-doomed-from-the-start family prove super-unlucky, both getting offed with a single arrow (the cops were actually smart enough *not* to have any metal on them...though that doesn\'t do them much good, since Erik takes them all out using his dead daughter\'s necklace).Erik\'s not the only one having a sucky day, as young Scott/Cyclops unintentionally manifests his powers at school...giving it a new sunroof. The WTF-ery continues with a young Storm (just when you thought her hair couldn\'t get worse...she\'s got a mohawk), who\'s a thief, taking Smurfpocalypse HOME with her like he\'s a stray dog (despite witnessing the messed-up stuff he does to people), introducing him to TV...which is how he \'learns\' about humanity, and she\'s the first in his recruitment of a new Four Horsemen, soon followed by Psylocke (the sum-total of her unexplained powers we see is a glowing pink sword and whip), Angel (whose burned/broken wings are replaced with new blade-shooting metal ones. They should\'ve named him \'Archangel\' to avoid confusion with the previous versions) and Magneto, who\'s now p.o.\'d at the world after his family\'s demise.Meanwhile, Scott\'s brought to Xavier\'s school by his older brother Alex/Havok (who, like Storm, sports some seriously questionable hair), he meets young Jean Grey (GoT\'s Sophie Turner, only succeeding about *half* the time at sounding American. Two things you can always rely on from the X-films: dodgy hair and accents) and then, along with Nightcrawler and Jubilee, they go to see Return of the Jedi...which leads to the writers\' attempt at self-referential humour regarding movies (was Jean\'s line about how \'the third one is always the worst\' intended to warn us about *this* movie\'s quality?). Fortunately, they\'re away from the X-Mansion when Smurfpocalypse and his B-team of Horsemen invade. Unfortunately, foolish Havok (not listening to Charles) gets himself/the X-Mansion blown up.Fortunately, Evan Peters\' Quicksilver happens by at the exact right moment, rescuing everyone (well...except Havok, of course, who\'s no longer needed now Scott\'s around). Clearly this slow-mo/super-speed sequence is intended to replicate the one from DoFP (which, unlike most, I wasn\'t particularly impressed by). Prior to Havok\'s immolation, Charles ordered him to \'wreak havoc\' (in a rather forced attempt to have their own ""Hulk? Smash."" moment), destroying Cerebro when, once again, the villain intended to use it for EVIL (by now Cerebro\'s about neck-and-neck with the X-Jet for which one\'s been sabotaged/destroyed the most). When that fails, Smurfpocalypse simply has his Horsemen kidnap Charles (so he can amplify his power/connection to everyone and control them). They then proceed to mostly stand around/do nothing until the film\'s climax.Sadly, Mystique doesn\'t kick much butt (just gets strangled), so it\'s up to the new crew to handle the Boresome Foursome and Smurfpocalypse, who is the only real match for them, growing HUGE at one point during a Battle-of-the-Minds with Charles, thoroughly thrashing him after a failed attempt to make him the new vessel (causing his hair loss in the process...as apparently baldness is a prerequisite for the role) until Jean *finally* lets loose her \'Phoenix Force\', making short work of Smurfpocalypse (maybe next time LEAD with that!). Angel\'s dead, Psyclocke skulks off, and Storm\'s welcomed into the X-Mansion (despite aiding the enemy), which Jean rebuilds with Erik\'s help (the last exchange between him and Charles is just their dialogue from the end of the first film being reused/recycled), then Mystique gives a pep-talk to the newly-formed team of young X-Men now dressed in what resembles their comic-book costumes.Speaking of costumes, Olivia Munn looks good in her boob-windowed outfit (oh sure, NOW you go for comic-book accuracy!), but like the majority of the new actors (whose performances range from average to pretty bad, while the returning actors seem to have lost enthusiasm) in the movie, her character\'s hardly developed. While nobody can ever equal Alan Cumming\'s Nightcrawler, I felt Kodi Smit-McPhee did the best out of the new additions taking over previously-established roles. Despite the film\'s attempted \'epic-ness\', it mainly feels like a bunch of random/questionable ideas (including extraneous Wolverine cameos) thrown together. Oh well, if nothing else, at least they gave us plenty of boob...I mean blue!', ""This was a truly great film, that has to be said. I was never massively captured by X-Men films in the past but since I watched Days of Future Past I was immediately captivated. I went back and watched all the original films and am now a true fan of the franchise. This film had everything as it takes you back through the origins of the cast of the first X-Men film. Perhaps the best origin story of them all, and there were a lot to follow believe me, is that of The Wolverine. Now when he was first shown in the trailer I was hesitant as to his role but as it turns out it was the best role they could have given him.*This where there will be some spoilers*. Wolverine makes his appearance when a group of the mutants are captured by Colonel Striker. Jean Grey, Cyclops and Nightcrawler are roaming around the base when they come across a highly guarded crate which seemed to have some sort of animal in it. It was Jean Grey who identified that it wasn't an animal in the crate, she then continued to open the crate just in time for a group of guards to arrive, before being torn to shreds by a rather angry and distressed Hugh Jackman. During his 5 minute screen time we get to see the aftermath of him being tested on. This isn't linked to the abomination that was 'X-Men: Origins' but a link to his over solo film 'The Wolverine'. Then right at the end we see Jean Grey tap into his memories and give him some back so that he calms down and is able to be that extra 1% happier. The last we see of him is as he goes running off into the cold snowy mountains, a familiar setting to where we see him in 'The Wolverine'. It was a truly fantastic cameo appearance and really acts as a great prequel.I wasn't surprised that this film was great but there were some real stand out performances, McAvoy and Lawrence are no surprise but I was very happy with how Oscar Isaac portrayed the character of Apocalypse incredibly well. We were also able to see the wrath of Havok only shortly before... Well lets not spoil the entire movie. Unless you've read the comic books go and see what happened.Honestly can say this was a great film and was plenty to watch, loads of action and some great story telling. The visual effects were phenomenal although the only downside would perhaps be Psylocke's outfit, wouldn't say it matches her comic book outfit that well but you can easily get over it.Enjoy the film and I hope you agree on the Wolverine cameo scene."", 'Maybe it\'s because I had a bigger expectation for this film, but it was aiight. In the movie there is a scene where mutant students come out of the theater after watching ""Return of the Jedi"". And says something along the lines of the third installment being the worst. And that basically applies to this film, because in my opinion it\'s the weakest compared to the previous two X-Men movies. It\'s in no way a bad movie, but it just wasn\'t anything all that amazing either. Because the editing and progression of the story just wasn\'t all that compelling or interesting. Watching this movie was like watching ""Rocky 4"", it\'s alright but just not good as ""Rocky"" and ""Rocky 2"". The plot is basically about Apocalypse getting resurrected, finding his four horsemen while the new group of students get recruited into Xavier Institute. With it focusing in on Magneto the most next to Apocalypse with his side story and what makes him tick. It really did show how how much of a human character Magneto really is. I mean even the kindest people out there has a breaking point when you push them to their limit. I guess the human side of Magneto and the understanding of where he is coming from to a degree is what makes him one of the most popular comic book villains out there. The other horsemen that Apocalypse chooses just seemed to be shoehorned into the movie. There is few scenes that did stand out and it\'s basically the super action sequences. There is the introduction scene, Quicksilver to the rescue scene, Wolverine going berserker rage mode, Quicksilver fighting Apocalypse, Professor X going Freddy Krueger and Phoenix Force. So overall I don\'t regret seeing this movie in the theater, I do however regret seeing it in 4D. Because I personally thought it just wasn\'t worth it for this one. You can tell a lot about a man if you give him the crown and what he chooses to do with his power and how he treats people that are less fortunate. And I liked that type of message in this movie. Although the whole thing of the team getting together and bonding like a family isn\'t anything new but was nicely done. So I give this movie a 7.4/10.7.4/10', 'I personally thought Days of the Future Past to be the best of the series. And as it turns out, Apocalypse is the worst one to date.The only bright spot in all the awfulness is Quicksilver, whose slo-mo scene is at least as good as in the previous movie, if not better. Other than that, everything else goes from mediocre to outright terrible.The main villain\'s motivation is bland and stupid. (Yeah, he just wants to kill everyone and rule the world.) The way he ""persuades"" other mutants to join him is absolutely unbelievable - he basically just offers to increase a mutant\'s power and in return demands help to kill billions of people. Sounds like a fair deal. What\'s offputting is that the extent to which he augments his followers\' powers is not constant. Like, Magneto gains the power to control pretty much all the metal on the planet at once, while Psylocke gains another special effect on her CGI laser beams or whatever it is that she emits. Apocalypse\'s abilities in general are largely undefined - at times he is shown pulling matter from objects around him to construct something, and then in the next shot he just makes solid objects like armor out of thin air. Another ridiculous thing was that they tried to make Isaac more intimidating by giving him thick soles so that he\'d look taller, which is noticeable. What is more, his lines are cringe-worthy, but the problem is, so are everyone else\'s. Same boring cliché dialogues like ""It\'s your home. We will help. Join us, Eric. I see good in you.""Yeah, forgiving Magneto like it\'s nothing after he helps to kill millions of people and destroy entire cities is included in the package. Also, he changes his mind about the whole ""destroy the world"" thing after Mystique tells him for the 100th time that he is her family and she still sees good in him.Some of the characters\' looks are still beyond ugly. I can actually see why they chose to try to keep the Beast and Mystique in their human forms more, except for saving the actors from the extensive make-up procedures. The thing is, these characters look absolutely god-damn atrocious and are painful to watch. I mean, Lawrence is annoying and redundant when she is on screen anyway, but when she is also blue, it just becomes vomit-inducing.Recent 2016 comic-book blockbusters also did not enjoy good scripts, but at least they had high-quality gripping action scenes. This is not the case here, as fighting is mostly goofy and bland, and at times it is clearly visible by the actors\' motions that they are being pulled by the strings. Or being drawn in cheap CGI.This is actually sad. Singer\'s previous movie, DotFP, was outstanding. The recent Deadpool, who ostensibly shares the universe with the X-men, was awesome. And now we get a horrible, outrageously stupid and pretentious CG-overdosed mess. Let\'s hope the next one will be better.', ""Apocalypse who was the first mutant ever, is from the Egyptian days. Awakens in 1983, he is more powerful than ever, and puts together his own band of mutants in hopes of world domination. It's up too Charles Xavier(James McAvoy) and his band of young mutants in hopes of stopping him.The well known characters like Cyclops and Havok and not to mention Beast don't really stand out as much they should. McAvoy is okay as Professor X, but it's Michael Fassbender as Magneto, that really takes the film, showing more Lars to the character, I was really liking his story arch. Jennifer Lawrence is alright here as Mystique. But Oscar Isaac has Apocalypse is creepy but no so much menacing, the animated Apocalypse was way more menacing. The effects are pretty descent, battle scenes enjoyable. I wonder there gonna be any more X-Men films, for me it ends with me not wanting anymore."", 'So after loving DOFP, circumstances (eg: Holiday)caused me to have to wait several weeks after the release date to watch this movie and before showtime I had heard mixed reviews, but with most of them leaning towards a poor one I went in without any expectations so that I may avoid any potential disappointments. Now firstly let me say I wasn\'t disappointed, I found this film to be a decent enough entry in to the Xmen universe, certainly better than some other notable entries (Origns - I\'m talking to you...). There was lots in this film that I liked, mostly as it seemed more loyal to the cartoon I watched back in my youth that I loved so much. There were plenty of characters involved in the film, comic book style action sequences and the always fun quicksilver scene, such a welcome addition to the xmen movies, and something that maybe points out one thing Marvel have done wrong with a character in their films... The Weapon X ""cameo"" - I enjoyed this but think it would have been so much better had they not spoilt this in the trailer, it fitted well with the story and you knew you were going to Alkali lake so it would\'ve been nice to have had the anticipation of whether you would see Wolverine, but it was done well done and I liked that this was all we saw of him. Now I like the Wolverine character but personally felt that the original trilogy suffered due to an overdose of Wolverine, yes he was the main character of the first films but none of the other characters got developed which I felt made the films suffer, this is why I liked that Cyclops had a much more prominent role in this film and enjoyed that it seemed to focus more on him and Jean Grey and his rise to becoming a leader of the X-men.Now this wasn\'t the perfect film and there were bad points that I found to it. The pacing of the film was a little strange at times, it was a shame that Havok\'s death seemed to be almost glossed over ""He was closest to the explosion"" ""Oh, I thought I got everyone"" ..... ""Oh well, never mind...!"" Bit of a shame as we never got to see the ""Bad ass"" he was made out to be in the previous outings. Speaking of deaths I did have a sneaky feeling there may be another one in the film and almost expected Mystique to die in the final battle, especially with her being built up as a hero all the way through the film, but then wondered if Quicksilver might perish when taking on Apocalypse on by himself - in another fantastic sequence, but this was not the case.Whilst it was good to see a big cast, The horsemen seemed to just be ""there"" and with the exception of Storm (slightly) were not fleshed out - Angel is seemingly built up as some seasoned warrior and is introduced with a cage fight scene having just beaten the blob and having gone 10 fights undefeated (Which we don\'t see any of) before he meets nightcrawler where he promptly gets his ""ass handed to him"". Even in the rematch at the end of the film he still struggles to put up any kind of fight. Psylocke was just sat in a room with Caliban evidently as his bodyguard, and for no real reason just decides to join Apocalypse, though this may be to save Calibans life?? But it would\'ve been nice to have spent a little more time giving them some character - especially in a 2 & 1/2 film.My biggest problem though which I had ever since he was announced was Oscar Issac as Apocalypse. Whilst I have no problem with him as an actor I just never saw him as being that character and wasn\'t convinced of him at any point through the film. Apocalypse is a hugely overpowered mutant who has a deep booming voice and should be menacing and instil fear in to those he meets, yet Issacs is tiny and had too much of a softly spoken voice in the film and I just found he didn\'t fit the part at all., he just looked like one of the gang when stood with his horsemen. Now whilst I\'m not saying he should\'ve had the part instead, I think someone like the Rock, with his build, would\'ve been more visually suited to the character, but that\'s just my opinion.Whilst this does almost wrap the whole Xmen story up I do hope there is another one after this, they have after all teased the Phoenix saga again so can see this being the next big thing, though I think the next film will be too soon for this story to resolve as it will need fleshing out more first, but the end credit scene leaves a couple of potential movies, with a potential creation of X-23, or hopefully Mr Sinister as the next big bad. But overall it\'s a good enough entry and I don\'t think it\'s as bad as some people have said, it\'s certainly not worthy of the 1\'s and 2\'s out of 10 that some people have given it??? But again it\'s the nods to the comics and cartoons which I liked about the films, with the scene at the end with the team in their cartoon costumes in the training room a brilliant way to end the film.', ""In this case, It was not the worst one in my opinion. The film was really solid and I thought that it was good. While it was not in my opinion better than DOFP it still had a great story and lots of cool sequences. I am glad that they did not go overboard with this one like they did in The Last Stand. I think most people that like x-men well still think that it was a decent movie. Unless they just don't like the superhero thing. All the new actor and actress'd did a great job. There were though some parts in the movie that i thought should have gone by faster. Like some of the shots where a hero does something cool and we see him or her stand in glory is getting old and may have been over used in this film in my opinion. I liked the inclusion of history and the scenes with erik are my favorite.Micheal Fassbender stole the show for me again. As well as the new Scott and Jean Grey they did a marvelous job. There were some continuity issues that i saw with Storm but, whatever. Ill accept her accent for now. I do wish that i saw more from Olivia Munn's character, i felt like she was just there. I also wish they set up or fixed the passing of getting all the four horseman together. In this case the third one was not the worst, but it was still a great addition to the X- Men universe."", ""According to critics at Rotten Tomatoes listen, I got out expectations for this movie, but Bryan Singer managed to silence the haters, with a funny and straight out of the comics history. I love the reinvention of the X-Men young and costumes are the best I've seen. At last we see a villain who will wreak havoc in the lives of these mutants although would have been better as their best moments were when he was white eyes. Another thing I do not like anything was Angel. Okay, I know it's difficult to put it blue but that Miley Cirus hair. Wolverine's cameo was impressive as we see with that Weapon X suit.Well, after the end of this movie is a reminder because we already know where the story part. As Hank said, time is like a river, you can have stones then return to normal.The movie is good and I recommend it if you're a fan like me of the X-Men"", ""Okay i have no idea what these critics are smoking..same people who thought deadpool was a dead and pg13 superheroes don't make it..anyways..XMEN great film the best out of the series if not right up there with Days of future Past. story was pretty close to Apocalypse story line, exception of Psylock being cast out of time..she was still amazing to watch..Olivia munn did a great job i think as psylock..and yes psylock was originally a villain and later became an xman..or woman..Apocalypse character was best villain adaptations in any comic book to big screen transfers in a long time..character, demeanor and abilities was very close to comics..last battle was bit stale..didn't feel like a epic last confrontation with a god..but overall pretty action packed not as much as civil war and not as much as i would liked..but it was good. Quicksilver was amazing as usuall better than days of future past.wolverines quick cameo was a nice bonus and ties into the overall plot line. storm was done even better here i think than holly.b version, which i never thought they did justice. Here however she feels and acts more like storm. overall amazing movie. one of the best in the series and contender against any movie out there..so go see it and decide for yourself.."", ""Okay, this is already the fourth superhero film we have gotten so far this year. The fact that it's this good blows my mind, it's the sixth entry in the main X-Men series, and it might be the third best after X2 and Days of Future Past. Oscar Isaac gives an outstanding performance as the mutant menace: Apocalypse, he was the highlight of the film right next to Fassbender's Magneto (who never fails to deliver). In a year with pathetic and disappointing superhero film villains so far, Apocalypse gives us the layered and threatening performance we want from our villains. Evan Peters returns as Quicksilver once more to give us an amazing scene that tops the one from Days of Future Past. The newcomers are fantastic and exciting and we will certainly see them again in the future. They also finally got Cyclops right! Forget about Rotten Tomatoes and go see this film opening weekend, you won't regret!"", ""I've got to be honest. This was the comic book movie I was least looking forward to this year but I went to see it anyway because the trailers made it look decent. I didn't go in expecting much but I was surprised when I really enjoyed this movie. It is no where near as good as First Class and Days of Future Past but it is still worth your time. Apocalypse was a great villain and Oscar Isaacs played him brilliantly. I also didn't mind the costume that much (It could have been better though). Most of the cast was really good in the film (My favourite being Evan Peters as Quicksilver). However unfortunately Jennifer Lawrence was not at her best in this film. She just didn't have the enthusiasm and looked bored for most of the film. I also didn't really like the actress that played Jean Grey. I'm not sure what her name is but to me she was just kind of wooden and boring to watch. I do wish that they could have developed the horseman though (Not counting Magneto) because it seemed like they didn't have much reason to suddenly be bad (Especially Psylocke). The things this film sets up also gets you quite exited for future instalments. I definitely think it is a good thing that they seem to be re-doing The Dark Phoenix Saga and possibly introducing one of my favourite X-Men villains: Mr Sinister. Overall this film is enjoyable and any comic book fan will most likely enjoy it because it is still better than Batman Vs Superman."", ""Wait a minute.. just wait a minute...A bloke with superpowers does a lot of damage.. sees the light.. tries to be a good bloke in Poland.. tries to help someone.. gets found out.. wife and kid are efficiently skewered by a single arrow.. he gets all moody and turns into a bad bloke...Then.. this bad bloke with boiling blood.. murders millions of people ..

Definitely up there with 'First Class', but falls short of being better. Apocalypse is a great villain, but doesn't get enough screen time. Quicksilver's scene is nothing short of epic. I never thought they could surpass his scene in DoFP, but somehow they have. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are also great as Professor X and Magneto. The only major gripe I have is Mystique: I do feel like Jennifer Lawrence at this point is phoning it in, and her disguise gets way too much screen time. She's only really Mystique for like 2 scenes (not even for any full scenes).Overall though I really enjoyed 'X-Men Apocalypse', despite some small issues."", ""Younger versions of the iconic X-Men: Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm and Nightcrawler finally make their debut. We also get introduced to young Psylocke and Angel since their big screen debut in the travesty that was, X-Men 3: The Last Stand. Some characters shined brighter than others, leaving the rest in the dust. There is a lot of fun action, easter eggs and nods to the comics. This film was the first in the X-Men series to truly cater to comic-book fans rather than the casual movie goer, which ultimately is the reason behind the flak director Bryan Singer is receiving.Sophie Turner, Tye Sheridan and Kodi-Smitt McPhee really delivered as the iconic young X-Men. Turner, who played Jean Grey, really stood out as the breakout performance of the movie. Her being branded as an outcast amongst outcasts due to her lack of control. There was so much power in Turner's performance of Jean Grey that will surely give way to future films for her. Sheridan gave us a rebellious Cyclops unsure of his role in the world, until the time came for him to step up, where he showed subtle signs of becoming the leader we know him to be. Kodi Smit-McPhee was a promising Nightcrawler. All of the horsemen aside from Apocalypse were mere action pieces. It was fun to watch, but such a let down as a core comic book fan. Storm once again was underused for the other characters to shine.Lastly, Oscar Isaac did a pretty good job with what he was given. At times he was repetitive and monotone, but his charisma as an actor really shined! All in all this movie was made for core comic book fans.

y touching a TV. Yes yes; it is not the internet; but it is such a concept. Anyway; Apocalypse learns all the languages this way and sees the atrocities of humanity. What kind of powers did he have? He came from the beginning of mankind;" and then jumps to the """"present"""" where he magically has a mutant power that lets him access """"technology"""". Anyway"; awful! Reading minds would have been better. 3) The Angel transformation scene is simply stupid.. rock music; alcohol;" a cool pose.. Apocalypse\'s way of """"convincing"""" others into joining him is as bad. He says """"come with me"""" and that\'s it. What does he want? To kill all! Sure"; I\'ll join. 4) Apocalypsis takes Magneto to his conncentration camp (which is intact after who knows how many years) and somehow knows about Magneto\'s past for some reason. Knows his name; knows how he feels. 5) X-Men insults the Star Wars trilogy; calling the third (Return of the Jedi) as the worst one. Why? 6) Oh yes; Magneto lost everything; again. For some reason; he hasn\'t learned his lesson; and continues to hang out with women and have children. Then they get killed and he blames everyone! 7) Stan Lee\'s cameo is.. nothing. Him looking at the sky as a civilian. 8) Somehow; aside from being somewhat telepathic; or so I understood; Apocalypsis can also teleport for some reason. But then he states he needs Xavier\'s powers! So; which is it? Do you have all powers or don\'t? If you can do most of what it is shown you can do; why do you need 4 horsemen; or other mutants? 9) Quicksilver\'s scene; while awesome; is super coincidental. No reason why he should have saved everyone from an exploding mansion. He isn\'t in super speed 100% of the time! Nor he knows the place is exploding! Yet he walks right to the center of the mansion and sees and rescues everyone. Ugh. 10) So;" a """"psychic event"""" destroyed all the world\'s nukes"; and Colonel Stryker tracked the source to Xavier\'s mansion.... suuuuure. 11) Wolverine shows up and kills people;" retconing his origin. He then runs in the snow. Fine. There is no real """"Berserker Rage"""". Anyway"; sucks and unnecessary. 12) Psylocke uses a whip to fight; instead of her psyonich blades. 13) Magneto goes all-out-destructive with little reason.. but wait;" he becomes good with even less. 14) Mystique turns into Psylocke and for some reason she has a blade. It was a """"twist"""""; if you can call it that. This scene; where she attempted to kill Apocalypse is the closes the writer could come close to a surprise situation. 15) Apocalypse turns big; yes; in a mind sequence. Looks bad by the way. Apocalypse does little to no shifting actions. He remains as seen in the pictures. 16) Quicksilver DOESN\'T tell Magneto he is his father. The reason? There isn\'t one.They said Lawrence didn\'t do much in the movie; that it was the kids that did.. but ultimately; nobody really does anything. The fights are not even 2% of the movie; it\'s mostly talk (some bad lines; nothing mind bending). Mutants underused; which is the biggest let down. The movie is a lot of nothing! Oh; and the X-men have Sentinels now; for some reason.. Lots of stuff; lots of nothing. Not even a good waste of time.'; 'X-Men: Apocalypse was very fun; but got quite messy at parts. X-Men fans will like this just like I did. it is a huge step down from Days of Future Past and has a pretty clichéd villain. I forgave the clichéd villain because of how cool and how frightening he was. Oscar Isaac did so good as Apocalypse. The characters are well developed; but some of them do not get enough screen time and some get to much. Angel; Psyloche and Storm have no motivation; there is no reason why they agreed to help Apocalypse destroy the world. What would they gain? Overall I thought the movie was good;" I had a blast watching it and will be watching it again.']"""

BUT *spoilers ahead* I had so many issues with the basic logic in the plot. Once future Muri dies, basically nothing made any sense to me. Chris Pratt bringing the toxin back in time would erase future Muri\'s timeline regardless of what he did with the toxin so he was never going to be able to go back there. I had assumed the whole time that their plan was to bring the toxin back in time and then just kill the aliens with it when they showed up in Chris\'s timeline and then just solve the problem for humanity as a whole because of course Muri\'s timeline will never be saved because that\'s not how the writers decided time travel works. But of course, then Chris Pratt just kept telling us how he\'s going to go back to future muri and save those 500,000 people instead of the other 8 billion, or about how ""he\'s running out of time"" to stop the frozen aliens who we very well know aren\'t going to wake up for another 30 years, and god damn him just running in to their space ship blindly and trying to take them on with their small ragtag crew instead of spending some portion of their next 30 safe years planning how to deal with the aliens safely just was like wait what!! Stop! Bring more people at the very least! Everyone in the world was convinced that ""people from the future came back and need help fighting aliens"" but they\'re not going to believe that you found those aliens in a glacier??????????????? And I love how the toxin that was supposed to save humanity killed like 6 of the aliens in total, and they wound up just blowing the spaceship up instead.', ""This is the best worst movie I've ever seen.SPOILERS-FREE:The good: Great CGI, great action, good performances, entertaining, some interesting plot twists.The bad: Most jokes are a miss. Clichés everywhere. Chris Pratt's hairdo and wardrobe. The script's plotholes were covered with play-doh.Don't get me wrong. It was entertaining and good CGI. 90's vibe was so strong and there were so many cliches, at times it felt as a parody. At this point I am not sure if it was or not.The falling heroin reaching out dramatically while falling to her death in slow motion, probably there are enought secenes like this to make a short compilation.A slow motion body hitting a car which was completely unnecessary.HERE COME THE SPOILERS\nThis is what I mean by play-doh:The wife's realization of the one thing that will let them find the aliens was just lazy writing.They needed a Volcano expert and the best they could do, with humanity's future at stake, was a high school volcano aficionado.The hero's father happened to be a government-hating airplanes pilot, just because one of such will be needed near the end.The toxin that they worked so hard to get killed like 5 of the aliens, the rest were just blown up, that was hilarious.After finding the alien ship, they couldn't wait a couple days to make a plan, or at least get enough people and toxins for all the aliens in the ship, instead of storming inside and killing half of them.

It's formulaic, it's predictable, and it has holes. I admit, I don't always watch movies for fine storytelling. If a quality story is your overriding interest, you should look elsewhere, because The Tomorrow War doesn't really have one.What it does have is time travel paradox, awesome action, great special effects, cool stunts, killer cinematography, an everyman hero, and the most creative monsters I've seen in a while. It even takes a stab at character development, and deals with father-daughter and father-son relationships in a way a lot of people can probably relate to.I think truly entertaining movies are pretty few and far between, so I was pleased to see this.

But I just can't.The script has no soul, like it was written by an android, and if it weren't for the A-list actors elevating (just a bit) the material, this movie would be suited for an awful SyFy original.If you've ever seen Edge of Tomorrow, this movie feels like the dollar bin version of that, made by some terrible production company."", 'Nothing fancy here, no wow factors, no unexpected scenes, infact we have seen this all many times in many movies but you know what, its still managed to keep my interest for over 2 hours.So get some popcorn, get your gang together, sit back and relax on your couch and enjoy some brainless action because we all need some entertainment in these times.Much Love to you people.💙', ""It's an entertaining movie with a story that makes you scratch your head because it just doesn't make sense.

A lot of money went into this and it is clearly well made.Unfortunately it seems to have been written by people who were either joking or morons.I don't need a movie to be brilliant to enjoy it. I don't even need it to be plausible. I do however need it to at least look like it's trying to give me the outline of something that could make sense.There is too much stupid in this movie to give an exhaustive list but my top 3 annoyances are:1) With the benefit of 30 years notice of an alien invasion and a time travel portal that can seemingly transport an unlimited amount of people and material both ways, we are meant to believe the best solution the entire world could come up with to fight the aliens is to hand civilians with no training guns and then batch drop them into the alien hordes in their hundreds of thousands to be slaughtered.2) When the aforementioned civilians are being slaughtered 10 mins after arriving in the future, instead of being struck dumb with terror, they still have time for plenty of wisecracks.3) The ending... oh the ending. Just when I thought peak stupidity had been reached, after consulting a child in high school class (I kid you not) for the solution the 'heroes' decide not to involve governments of the world and end the alien threat all by themselves with Chris Pratt killing the final alien in hand to hand combat."", ""The space time continuum would've been broken and rendered the entire story impossible at multiple points. As much as I love Chris Pratt, the writing in this wasn't great. Go watch Looper if you want a fun Sci-fi time flick."", 'I\'ve never written a review before but after watching this movie I just had to.No amount of CGI can make up that stupid nonesense of a plot. I did not except much from this movie beforehand but it managed to get even worse.Poor story, one-dimensional characters.There\'s an alien invasion in the future and the only solution mankind comes up with is sending untrained civilians that don\'t even know how to load a gun into the future.Half of them die on impact, the other half mysteriously survive falling 500ft from the sky into a shallow pool on a rooftop.They manage to secure some samples from a laboratory by having unlimited ammo.After that, they do some research on a female alien only to be completely destroyed by a horde of male aliens. Chris Pratt\'s daughter, a military biologist in the future, is able to find a toxin that could potentially kill all aliens.However, Chris Pratt almost kills himself in a stupid act of trying to save his daughter because he clearly does not understand the logic of time travel.If he can go back in time with the toxin, the war would likely never start and his daughter would never die anyways.The soldiers come back from future with a possible solution to everything and are told that government don\'t want to spend roughly 5,000$ of ""tax payers money"" for a flight to Russia when they\'ve already spend billions of dollars to make time travel possible in the first place.Why Russia? They have asked a 15 year old boy from high school who is interested in volcanos and he came up with the solution to end all of this in a matter of seconds.Now that they know the possible location of the aliens AND have a toxin to potentially kill all of them 30 years before the war even starts, they surely would wait and think this through for a couple of years right? Nope.They just stupidly break into the alien ship, mess everything up completely, kill about three aliens with the toxin, only to blow up the whole ship before hell breaks loose and they\'re very close to waking up all of the aliens in the presence.If this was enough already, Chris Pratt uppercuts the last female alien in a hand to hand combat to finally kill it.I can understand how you give this a 6/10 if you can shut off your brain completely while watching this movie. Everyone giving this a 8, 9 or 10 is completely crazy or has never ever watched an actual good movie before.', ""Yoooo - Pretty decent film all things considered.Chris's Pratt - does a good job, as expected.Story has a few holes but nothing big enough to dampen the overall enjoyment.6.5 stars for me.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Generally when there's movie franchises they make movies in the form of trilogies. But later this year when Fast and the Furious 6 comes out it'll be the sixth movie in the series which shows the level of box office appeal the series has to be able to pump out an average of 1 movie every two years is quite impressive. The only other series doing that kind of productivity with different directors on basically a once every 2 year rate is the James Bond series.Vin Diesel who outside of his other series Riddick movies generally puts out mediocre to bad performances was basically made to play the role of Dominic Torretto. Same goes for Paul Walker, normally when I see he's going to be in a movie I don't bother watching it. But somehow when these 2 guys get together in a movie about driving fast cars with hot girls it turns into a guilty pleasure."", ""The Fast and the Furious is not a great movie by any means, but it is very entertaining. It's definitely a turn-your-brain-off-for-two-hours flick, a nice popcorn flick. The plot is your basic undercover cop conflicted by his attachment to those he is infiltrating kind of thing. No real surprises here. The acting is quite good. I'm putting my money on Vin Diesel becoming the next Arnold Schwarzenegger. Michelle Rodriguez, who was just amazing in last year's Girlfight (she is why I saw this film), is extremely sexy in it. Oh yeah, she gives a good performance, too. I hope she gets some great roles after the success of this movie. The other performers are all relatively good. There aren't any weak spots. The action, which is why most will see The Fast and the Furious, is very good. Although one might wonder why it takes five minutes, even in slow motion, for cars that go 150+ MPH, to travel a quarter of a mile, it doesn't hurt the flick too much. I generally don't like car chase movies. The Mad Max films and this are probably the only exceptions. I was clenching my teeth during several action sequences. 7/10."", ""This was an actual 'movie'. The sequels were just entertainment takes. People forgot about the actual contents of this movie.The main part of the movie is the trust-and-suspect-relationship between (undercover agent-) Brian and Dominic with his team.

You want Brian to get into the group and be with the beautiful cute girl. It is about 'the family'.It was also about Dom being a unique character who tells you about his past, his father's race, the 10-second-race story and all. It was exactly how a movie about cars, races and action should be. Simple but powerful and beautiful.This was all build up really well. In a cool traditional (unforced) way, we were introduced with cool cars, cool people, street-racing and stuff.Before the end, a series of events happened that made you very excited. These events that happened are somehow connected and brought a sort of realistic thrilling experience. Here, the acting skills were superb and the drama in the scenes were pictured in a pitch-perfect traditional way. Brian was a lot tougher here than in the sequels where he was like Dom's slave or something.It's beautiful to see Brian and Dom at the end: Brian betrayed him and should arrest him but instead, they do the 10 second-race and don't know what to think about each other. This race was one of the most memorable scenes in film-history. After Dom hits the truck and survives the air-spinning of his car, Brian gave him the keys of his car, his car that has just also finished the 10-second-race. So, he finally gave Dom a 10-second-car and by doing that, he officially shows that he is not going to arrest him anymore.Somehow, he knew that Dom should not be sent to jail all along, even though he appeared to be a trucker-thief after-all......"", 'I won\'t say: \'What were you expecting, an Oscar performance?

And despite having only worked on a few projects involving the Maya, I am well aware of the vast cinematic license used in Apocalypto - as well as the many aspects of Mayan life that the film's creators got right. My purpose however, is not to discuss ANY of this. Rather, I want to appreciate the film for exactly what it is - an entertaining and heroic story set in ancient Mesoamerica with the usual Mel Gibson attention to atmospheric use of details. The actors speak Mayan, but this is not The Passion of Kukulcan. The script nicely shows the range of customs and culture that actually thrived in Post-Classic Mayan times, and for once, depicts Native Americans as people with senses of humor! The costuming and sets are amazing and the warfare is honestly and brutally depicted.Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is the son of a chief in a small Mayan lowlands forest village during Post-Classic collapse. These Maya may well be ancestors of the contemporary Lacandon. Refugees have been seen in the forest and foreshadow a coming disaster. That shadow is a merciless battalion of mercenaries working for the patron god of a nearby urban center. They are seeking slaves and sacrificial victims. What can Jaguar Paw do to protect his young child, his pregnant wife, and his beloved village?Unlike some of Gibson's recent films, Apocalypto is a fairly straightforward adventure story with a lot of brutal action. It also hints at subtle but intelligent critique of religious fanaticism, elitism and classism, and displays a great respect (though not exaggerated, worshipful or patronizing) for the living culture it loosely portrays.Acting: ADirecting: ACinematography: A+Sets: ACostumes: A+Story: BScript: BHistorical Accuracy: C- (but who cares?)Worth seeing for adventure fans, and fans of ancient warfare films. But turn to Archaeology Magazine or Latin American Antiquity if you're too concerned with facts to enjoy prehistoric fiction."", ""I really don't get some of the comments, rating it one star because it didnt depict true mayans... There are obviously flaws in historical accuracy but who cares? It's a movie.. and it's brilliant. In another multiverse the Mayans probably did human sacrifice. The cinematography in this is outstanding, the acting.. costumes are all so good! There was a subtleness behind this genius screenplay, it didn't try to hard on the plot. One of my all time favourites of its kind!"", ""Without wishing to fall into the trap of critical hyperbole, I can honestly say that this is the most original and impressive American film that I've seen this decade, more so than the highly acclaimed likes of The Departed (2006) or No Country for Old Men (2007).

The liberals are over the top. The conservatives are over the top. Cliché after cliché, and they all seem silly. And they should: Clichés only become real after they are manifested too often in the world.The more subtle point is Crystal, the protagonist of the story. She represents the rest of us. Just an average person caught in the middle. She doesn't have a side. She doesn't deserve the injustice of her circumstances. She trudges on against the adversity. She's endowed with her own, potent wisdom, jaded by a world-weary point of view. She's just trying to survive. She's bemused by the insanity of the game, yet sober because her well-being is at stake.Crystal is an avatar for the average American who simply wants to survive, avoid ruin, and maybe have a chance at happiness, despite the crazy people with megaphones and power trying to do them in."", ""It took me a while to watch this based on reviews and all the political nonsense, but I am so happy I changed my mind. One of the most entertaining movies I've seen in the last year. While there are political undertones and references, they're not over played and it adds to the entertainment. I highly recommend this movie. It's good for some laughs, and isn't light on the action."", ""It had similar vibes of Ready Or Not, ideas and themes of The Purge and the unpredictability of The Cabin In The Woods.\nThe first act is pretty strong and it really throws you off course as to who you think the main protagonist will be. That just set me up nicely for not having a clue of where it could go next.\nIt moves at a good pace, the violence is brutal but cartoonish in its execution, the gags are solid and go down brave but potentially dangerous routes. I was fine with them. But it wouldn't surprise if some might offend the SJW cinema-goers.\nWhile the end was the most formulaic part of the film. The journey getting there made it a worthwhile watch."", ""A familiar but efficient action comedy with an extremely brisk pacing and some good satire aimed squarely at American politics. There's an anything goes policy here with every political position a target and that makes for good humour, at least as far as I'm concerned. It's noticeably violent, kicking off with lots of shock deaths and scenes, before turning into a female-led revenge thriller towards the climax. Aside from Hilary Swank, most of the cast are unknown but they do a pretty good job here. It's not an amazing film but it did entertain me throughout."", ""It's Battle Royal, meets Hunger Games meets Dodgeball meets Qanon.I'm not sure how seriously anyone should take this film, the comedy cartoon violence is closer to Tex Avery than Texas Chainsaw massacre.The underpaying theme of America's divided social class, conspiracy theory nut jobs and elitist middle class aren't really explored any any significant depth and perhaps that's the point.Escapist violence with a sick sense of humour. Watchable nonsense."", ""I know that none of the bad reviewers even watched this movie. It's not really a left or right movie but it shows how bad both of those sides are and the hero actually seems to be like most of us, somewhere in the middle. I hope people will give it a watch before passing judgment on it."", ""I'm open minded so I stuck it out. I wish I'd bailed. So many reviews on here and so mixed that I read a lot. I was hoping.....It has a few good moments but Hillary Swank doesn't show up until near the end and the ending isn't that good. Yeah, don't waste your time."", ""I love Betty Gilpin, this is the first time experience her acting talents and yup I want more :)\nShe's very good in action scenes and her facial animations are awesome.\nGive.her.more.work. 👍🏼"", 'Greetings again from the darkness. Let\'s face it. It was a brilliant marketing strategy. In the wake of mass shootings, the release date of this film was delayed when its subject matter was deemed controversial, even scandalous The film\'s new marketing slogan became, ""The most talked about movie of the year is one that no one\'s actually seen."" Of course, it wasn\'t really true, as very few were actually talking about it. But that\'s what made it genius marketing ... they created interest amidst controversy that has since proven unnecessary. Director Craig Zobel (Z FOR ZACHARIAH, 2015) has delivered the least controversial, non-polarizing film of the year. It basically laughs at extremes on the left and right, and reminds us how laughing at something can often take away its power. And regardless of your ""side"", you\'ll find some laughs here.If you\'ve seen the trailer, you know that the premise has a group of liberal elites hunting a hand-selected group of social media-active MAGA deplorables. It\'s a twist on Richard Connell\'s 1924 short story ""The Most Dangerous Game"", although the modern day rich aren\'t hunting for sport, but rather for political affiliation - gun lovers and climate change deniers. That may sound politically charged, but in fact, it plays as more comedy than comeuppance. Sure, the violence is over-the-top and often quite graphic, but this is a skewering of both red and blue.Preventing the project from falling into B-movie muck is a standout performance from Betty Gilpin (""Glow"") as Crystal. She\'s a Rambo-type who speaks (with a southern drawl) only when necessary, and seems to have learned a lot while serving in Afghanistan. Most of the time she looks like she has ""a pinch between her cheek and gum"" (a tip of the Stetson to Walt Garrison), and she also hums to herself and tosses down some unusual facial expressions. This is a seriously oddball performance that is the film\'s highlight.One of the best sequences of the film comes quite early as the dozen or so \'deplorables\' slowly wake-up and find themselves gagged in a field. A container of weapons leads to an early massacre that allows the filmmaker to tease us with numerous familiar faces taking turns as the heir-apparent lead. Some of the faces that pop up include Ike Barinholtz, Wayne Duvall, Ethan Suplee, Emma Roberts, Christopher Berry, Sturgill Simpson, Kate Nowlin, Amy Madigan, Reed Birney, Glenn Howerton, Hannah Alline (flight attendant), and Usman Ally.Of course we know this is headed to a showdown between Crystal and Athena (2-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank), the ringleader of the hunting party. A fight scene reminiscent of the KILL BILL movies (sans Samurai swords) takes place at Athena\'s ""manor"", and it is stunningly staged and executed. Unfortunately this scene also highlights the mostly inadequate dialogue that exists throughout the film. Some of the quips click, but many fall flat - surprising since the co-writers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof have previously collaborated on ""Watchmen"" and ""The Leftovers.""Blumhouse Productions keeps cranking out these offbeat genre films, and this one likely benefits from a misplaced scandal, and it strives for self-importance by comparing itself to George Orwell\'s ""Animal House"" and with an obscure reference to TEARS OF THE SUN (2013). It\'s not at the level of last year\'s gem READY OR NOT, and it missed the opportunity to make some political points, but it\'s a hoot to watch and as an added bonus, Hilary Swank teaches us the proper way to make a grilled cheese sandwich!', 'This movie is improperly categorized. It\'s entirely satire/comedy, and because of that, the violence is over the top. It pokes fun at both the ""ruling class""/elites who think they know what\'s best for the masses, and the those who rebuke that idea and want to live in the land of the free.', ""This movie was awesome! It's listed as horror, but there was plenty of action and comedic moments as well... will be watching this again soon!"", ""The witt with this movie comes from the fact that the smart ones play stupid and the stupid ones play smart. Imagine The Hunger Games with a bit of Hide and Seek. And that's what this movie is. The liberals play the bad guys, and the conservatives play the good guys. Which was anything BUT how the right wing media outlets portrayed it as. The acting from the protagonist Betty Gilpin is one of the best things about this movie! She took her role and absolutely ran with it. Where the film does fall flat is from it's extremely predictable plotline. Which copies from various thriller films made in the past. Overall I liked this movie! It was dark comedy with a strong politically charged twist."", 'How interesting that so much controversy would be generated by a film an inherently, and deliberately, silly as this one.A group seemingly unconnected Americans, of various ages and genders, awake to find themselves on a strange compound with the only clue to their situation being a large crate nearby. The crate contains a variety of weapons. Once armed, the people are then picked off by an unseen enemy.I don\'t know why I\'m being so coy in my synopsis, as you\'ll know from any of the advertising that the film is about ""liberal elites"" hunting ""deplorables"". What you won\'t get is the tone of the film, which is pretty much a comedy. A black comedy at times admittedly, but occasionally just an out and out comedy. The film I\'d most compare it too is ""Cabin in The Woods"" - as it takes a similarly well worn premise and manages to do some different and new things with it. However, ""The Hunt"" doesn\'t have ""Cabin\'s"" rewatchability. Once you know the plot, I can\'t really see another reason to come back to it.I\'d also say, the trailer for the film really does the movie a disservice, as it gives away a couple of the films secrets, including revealing who the lead ""Liberal"" is played by - which the movie goes to great lengths to keep concealed. The deaths are nicely done though, and often come out of nowhere, with a wonderful practical feel to the effects and it\'s a funny film, occasionally laugh out loud so. Betty Gilphin is great, as ever, in this.The controversy that\'d dogged the film seems pretty silly once you\'ve seen it. - although the advertising has played into it too - so they only have themselves to blame. I felt the film not only attacks both sides in equal measure but has an overall message of once you scratch the surface there being more that unites us than divides us.It\'s a solid, entertaining film - just not one with much replay value.', ""I expected nothing from this film I went there without waiting. It was good entertainment. I liked the satire, the humor and the fight scenes.\nOther than that, the acting has nothing breathtaking, but hey it's a horror movie."", 'This movie is an equal opportunity offender and it\'s hilarious. It pokes fun at everyone and says ""don\'t worry you can laugh, even if it\'s at your own expense"".I think the controversy around it makes it even funnier because I didn\'t find anything to be offended about in this movie because it\'s a satire, it\'s saying things with a wink and making fun of the characters saying these things. (I think anyway).Betty Gilpin is great in this and she really knew what movie she was in.It also has a way of keeping you on your toes especially at the start and was kind of refreshing.', 'Major spoilers alert.This film is great escapist fun that also satirizes the our bizarrely extreme cultural divide. It is refreshing to be able to bring gonzo humor and over the top gore as a way to step back from the mindless anger and group think. On top of that, Betty Gilpin\'s brilliantly played Crystal Creasy is something unique to film. While ostensibly written as a familiar Mary Sue able to kick any ass and beat down any threat, Crystal is a sardonic participant in a mad mad world. Highly intelligent yet without affectations, she really does not give a damn why everyone is trying to kill her. She is also the one character in the movie who does not comfortably fit into the extreme left or right stereotypes in spite of all the superficial appearances to the contrary.I also credit the writers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof for being willing to subversively skewer their own. Their sharpest barbs are reserved for their fellow Elites while the Deplorables are mostly just one dimensional cartoonish characters rarely provided with more depth than the aptly hilariously named Yoga Pants or Shut Up Gary.On the other hand, the elite hunters characters are fleshed out with many little details and conceits familiar to those who travel in similar circles. Athena babbles on tritely and unoriginally about the singular importance of cutting tomatoes with a bread knife and using Gruyere in her grilled cheese sandwich speech which takes place in the mansion she keeps insisting is NOT A MANOR! She and her compatriots toss off Animal Farm Snowball references as a sort of intellectual adornment, insult, and shibboleth while revealing that they understand next to nothing about a book they were probably once forced to read in some boring English class.The film\'s conflict originates with one of the Elite characters being found out sleeping with his wife\'s oncologist which leads to his dismissal from his charitable foundation. Another talks about his dubious devotion to a peasant lover he has inconveniently knocked up. They all look down on the hired hand Sargent Dale who is only allowed the smallest modicum of respect for having a small part in the Bruce Willis movie Tears of the Sun - ""why is the sun crying?"". Even the choice of having the action set in Croatia in something of a inside joke as that has recently been a preferred destination for the fashionable set seeking to avoid the common company of the hoi polloi.The movie starts with a turtle and ends with a hare mirroring the awesomely twisted and violent bedtime story that Crystal says her mother used to tell her. That story serves as a sort of explanation of her uniquely detached outlook and her singular ability to spot deadly threats based on the smallest of tells.At the film\'s conclusion, Crystal echos the story arc of the Napoleon Animal Farm character. She transforms from her deplorable self by donning Athena\'s signature red bottomed stiletto pumps, slipping into her stylish black dress, commandeering her plane, while tossing back Athena\'s prized champagne and caviar.Why it\'s a Cinderella story!Highly recommended if you have a sense of humor and can enjoy a stupid fun movie.', 'I could not believe how much I loved her in this movie. Her character alone is worth the watch. Some good kill scenes and a fun ride throughout.', ""All of you NEED to stop by the theater (be sure to avoid Covid-19) and watch this, because it is amazing! I don't think you understand. This social satire dark comedy psychological thriller is clever and takes good turns at the most. Betty Gilpin and Hilary Swank's performance is perfect and makes the experience even better. Yes, many characters are killed off quickly, but it all helps the story develop. You see, the writers have you think the movie is one thing, but it then changes frequently. It is a great must watch.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The cinematography and color choices are good for the film's setting and story. However, I had a hard wanting to care for the characters. They are barely developed and indistinguishable. It's hard keeping track of who's who. The story is simplistic and one-sided. A bit insight into the Somali's point of view of the event would have help the movie to be much more intriguing.

Everything unfolds in predictable fashion, but this B material is a fantastic showcase of wicked humor and misanthropic violence. Dan Stevens is in excellent form here, as a mysterious soldier who shows up unannounced at a family's home of a fallen soldier he served with. He's all smiles and very polite, but people with a usually negative connection with this family start meeting grisly ends. Like in his previous film You're Next, Adam Wingard approaches plotting you've seen a million times and wittily turns it on its ear without ever being too self aware. It's a shame Picturehouse who acquired the US rights dumped the film in a handful of theaters without trying to capitalize on the strong reviews and never bothered to expand it theatrically. The Guest is a quick fun time that knows exactly what it is and delivers without overstaying its welcome."", ""It feels almost inaccurate to refer to this movie as The Guest when in reality it was entirely carried by a wonderful performance by Dan Stevens. I enjoyed it thoroughly, which isn't at all to say it's what I would normally call a good movie. The movie is highly campy, reminiscent of '80s-'90s action movies / thrillers, and Dan Stevens brings in an excellent all around tongue in cheek tough 80's anti-hero performance. Stevens' acting is well matched by strong action that is to the point and not drawn out, as well as superbly chosen music, particularly in the climactic scenes. For any gamers out there, if you enjoyed Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon for the nostalgia and humor, you'll likely love this movie as much as I did."", 'I went in to the cinema with no expectations with this movie. I watched the trailer and assumed it will be some average movie but I was totally mistaken. The film is very fast paced with surprisingly some humor throughout. There was a lot of gruesome fight scenes (I personally jump watching violent scenes) but I get the reasons why they were there. Dan Stevens was a complete shocker with his performance. If you remember him from Downtown Abbey, his performance here is amazing! He portrays a brilliant character and he does an amazing American accent. All the actors were perfectly cast for this movie. I loved Maika Monroe, she reminded me a lot of Brittany Murphy and Gwen Stefani. The ending was totally not expected and I loved every bit. The music played reminded me a bit of Drive soundtrack but worked brilliant with this movie. I truly recommend the movie!!', ""Laura Peterson is home alone when a stranger shows up at her door.

The incident with the football team at the bar is perfect. I'm rolling with a slow descend into a dysfunctional family chaos. Instead, the movie adds an outside military story. I am less impressed with turning this into a shoot them up. By doing that, David's interesting psychological disturbance becomes an experiment gone wrong. In some ways, it's less scary. This is good but it could have been great."", 'I am mystified by the high score for this movie.

So you cannot go in to it thinking in a literal sense. You have to accept that it is not going to be some ground breaking epic and that it is just a bit of fun - but at the end of the day that doesn\'t matter, because if you go in with the right attitude and you enjoy it, then what does it matter that it is a bit ""off"" in places.

Van Helsing's search to find Dracula and complete his mission is not only bold daring, but full of great creature moments and awesome action.  David Wenham (Lord of the Rings) does a great job as the comic relief Friar who aids Van Helsing and Anna in their fight against Dracula and the other creatures they face.

'Kingsman' is an extremely quintessentially British flick full of over-the-top yet hilarious comedy, brutal violence and a quirky image of England. Since James Bond's debut in 1962, a number of films have attempted to reinvent the genre, with films like 'Johnny English', 'Get Smart', 'This Means War' and many more, however, none have come close to displaying the perfect blend like 'Kingsman' has. Matthew Vaughn has become renowned for taking on action-comedy projects, for instance 'Kick-Ass' (which is still stronger than this but only just), and along the way has kept that feel-good British aspect to it that makes our greatest secret agent (James Bond) such an icon. All-in-all 'Kingsman' is a brilliant, well-executed film."", ""I just came back from a pre-screening of 'Kingsman' and let me tell you: if you liked the first Kick-Ass, you are going to LOOOVE this film! I would never have thought that a stiff Brit like Colin Firth could pull off action - but boy, does he whoop ass in this one. I thought the story was rather original (don't know the Comic), it's a bit like an ultra violent James Bond parody. Or better: a crossbreed of Bond and Kick-Ass. Finally an action movie that doesn't use kiddie-gloves. The kid who plays the recruit is also worth mentioning. I've never seen him before but he really nails it. There's a lot of humor in this film, it really doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not overdone. And Sam Jackson finally found something he hasn't done yet. I guess his role was already spoiled a bit in the trailer, but believe me: you haven't seen Jackson in this kind of part before. This is an excellent, over-the-top bloody and sexy film for fans of old-school action films. I give it 10 stars. Highly recommended!"", ""Kingsman is a secret spy organization not connected to any government working in the shadows with no rewards and no fame.

Super billionaire villain Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has vicious hench-woman Gazelle and a devastating plan.It's fun, ultra-violent and expertly made. Matthew Vaughn delivers a sharp product.

Matthew Vaughn has given the punk genre a new flame with his new film ""Kingsman."" While many will see this movie expecting a poorly done money grabber that\'s riding the coattails of YA movies and James Bond. What ""Kingsman"" delivers instead is an action packed, in-your-face, anti-typical, punk rock movie (just without all the drugs and the angst... oh, and the music).Vaughn does not care if you like his characters, he does not care if you support their causes, and he does not care about your political stance. Vaughn only wanted to make a movie that was anti-stereotype, and he succeeded. This is even referenced in the dialogue multiple times throughout the film. While the movie could do without several scenes that only serve to add extra time to the already long duration of the film, there are almost no points in the film where an audience member should be bored or confused.

No academy awards here but that's nothing any sane person is expecting."", ""There were a few laughs and maybe one twist, but otherwise there just wasn't anything special about this script. The main thing that was special was having that many fabulous actresses in one film."", ""**Spoilers**Literally. Their jewellery heist is so perfectly planned after 5 years 8months and 12 days give or take for nothing to go absolutely wrong. \nLike this is not a action or crime movie. \nIt's a drama with an all star female cast that work well together so they don't have any problems...Recommend just watching it when it comes to DVD or Netflix"", ""If I were to compare it to the other Ocean's movies, I'd rank this as the second best amongst them all. It's your classic heist movie with wit and humor done really well with an amazing cast. Not sure what others were expecting to lambast it or the female casting so harshly."", ""Why do people dislike Ocean's 8?I believe this can be explained with Danny Ocean's 3 rules:\n-Don't hurt anybody.\n-Don't steal from anyone who doesn't deserve it.\n-Play the game like you've got nothing to lose.Upon being paroled, Debbie Ocean immediately steals a bagful of items from a department store and then commits credit card fraud by re-booking a hotel room after the couple have already left.The latter breaks rule number 2, the couple didn't deserve it. They were just innocent people enjoying a holiday.This sets the tone for the whole film. Debbie Ocean is a common thief who is smug, entitled and not very likable.Danny Ocean would be ashamed."", 'During more than five years imprisoned framed by her boyfriend, the con woman Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock) plots a scheme to heist the US$150 million Cartier necklace Toussaint from the Met Gala. She is released on probation and meets her former partner Lou (Cate Blanchett) and together they recruit a team of hacker, thieves, forger and swindlers to steal the necklace. ""Ocean´s Eight"" is another film of the exhausted franchise ""Ocean´s Something"" with famous cast and cameos. The predictable brainless story has plot holes and is reasonably entertaining. Further, it helps to sleep. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Oito Mulheres e um Segredo"" (""Eight Women and a Secret"")', ""It's not funny, the characters aren't charming, and worst of all for a thriller - there's no suspense. Even the sound tracking lacked punch. The characters also lack believability - they don't convince anyone they are criminals, hackers, grifters or anything of the sort. I can't really think of anything good to say about this film - it'll genuinely put you to sleep."", ""I think it's stars doesn't give it justice! Yes it is not like the original Ocean's movies don't expect that , but it is entertaining and the cast is fabulous. So go enjoy the movie and don't mind it's ratings."", ""The recent American heist film of Ocean's series. Ocean's Eight is different from the previous series which lead by an all-women cast. Compared to Ocean's eleven, this film does not pull out the original sense and rule as I expected, so don't be shocked that there are a lot of negative reviews from the fans. However, if we did not compare it to the previous series, the movie is not that horrible as the other reviews mentioned.The beginning of the movie has caught my attention with interesting theft tricks of shoplifting and re-booking hotel room after Debbie(Sandra Bullock) got out of jail. The film is not as thrilling as the heist that I expected, however, it's not too boring, the film flows exceptionally, it's not too intense, it's easy to watch and understand. Sadly, the plot is predictable and has the twist and end like the other Ocean's series, nothing could blow your mind on this Ocean's Eight. The movie leads by eight actresses with remarkable characters, each character has their areas of expertise. The cast is most of Hollywood and oscar-winning actresses such as Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and Helena Bonham. Surprisingly, the unexpecting cooperation of Anne Hathway at the end. I recommend to watch this film only for entertainment and watch it without the expectation of the original Ocean's series."", ""Fun moments in this movie, but overall things happen without much of a reason for us to care. It's a fine movie. Just fine."", ""I love Sandra Bullock who doesn't. But still like one reviewer says Cate would had been a great leader. And really a great actress who was there as Bullock's sidekick.Along with Rihanna a tech whiz, Helen Bonham Carter as a designer who has seen better days, Mindy Kaling looking to escape her overbearing mother in a store, Awkwafina as a car shark who steals stuff without anybody knowing, bored mother and profiteer that plans to split among themselves over in a $150M necklace worn by Anne Hathaway actress character.Over at the Met Gala aka the First Monday in May in NY. As Bullock's Debbie Ocean who had spent five years and eight moths and twelve days in prison. Over being a scapegoat to a former boyfriend, Richard Armitage and had a lot of time to plan this heist.Unlike the other male version George Clooney Ocean's 11-13 movies. The male supporting leads were only there used as props and given nothing more to do than just that. But these actresses are giving more to do and make you like them despite doing what they are doing in the heist.In case you all are wondering, Ocean is the estranged late brother of Danny played by Clooney who has since died for reasons unknown in the film.At least eight actresses get to show their skills unlike the male cast of the Clooney films. Fun loving movie."", ""This is one of those awful films consisting of too many famous people acting out a plot that has no backbone in the vain hope that their collective fame will patch the holes in the story. I wouldn't wipe my ass with this script."", 'It is suspenseful, intelligent, cerebral, and captivating. Casting eight women in the major roles is refreshing. This definitely proves that the prominent casts do not have to be incorrigibly masculine and aggressive. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.', ""Yes, it started out a bit slow, but gathered momentum w/how this strategically planned & rather clever steal and replace caper progresses. Well thought out, and scripted creative ways to fool the system and escape w/the loot. \nThere's some criticism about characters not being developed, but when you have eight stars in a movie you can't spend a lot of time on that aspect of the script. It's all about keeping the viewer guessing as to whether the planning is a success (not that I support crime) in this fantastical crime. A little predictable at times (not unexpected given how often this theme has shown up in movies) especially the laser trap avoidance.

It is also the best film in the series. Indy is hired by the US government to track down the sacred arc of the covenant. While he is on his quest the Nazis are also searching for the arc. This is a wonderful adventure story that covers many countries. Harrison Ford was born to play this role, and he does it with flair. After having seen this film quite a few times, you also get to pick out the Easter eggs that are scattered around. One hint is be on the lookout for two well known Star Wars droids.\nI do not think that there was a better combination in the 80's than Lucas and Spielberg. This in everything you would want from an adventure movie and more."", ""Loved the whole concept, it took me a minute to realize that the movie was set in the early 1940's, yeah I know, I'm a bit slow, but eventually I did catch on to what was going on.Harrison Ford did an outstanding performance as Indiana Jones in search of the Lost Ark. Loved the action packed scene, especially when he took the statue off of the mantel and that huge stone began to roll chasing him out of the cave. The movie had a lot of twist and turns and the comedy scenes were great even though I don't believe that it was intended to be funny, but it added more of a flavor to the movie.

Exiting and amazing through out the whole movie. Harrison Ford plays the role Indiana Jones amazingly. George Lucas and steven Spielberg did an amazing job as well and for me this is the best movie out of the whole Indiana Jones trilogi.', ""This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If that doesn't sell it, then look no further than Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun."", 'Original, exciting, and lots of fun. Spielberg directed it and Kasdan and Lucas wrote it. Without it, we wouldn\'t have had ""Romancing the Stone"", ""The Jewel of the Nile,"" ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Empire"", and many others too numerous to list. They were all more or less rip offs of this one. Of course the original was highly successful. I dragged my lugubrious ex to the theater and even SHE enjoyed it. For a while there was an attempt to merchandise Indiana Jones\' leather jackets, fedoras, and bull whips but they didn\'t get far.The fact that this was such a commercial blockbuster raised the inevitable question, which may be roughly phrased as, ""What do I do NOW, Ma?"" What you do is produce sequels: ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Amazon Women of the Moon,"" and so on. Each imitation, each sequel, was less innovative and more desperate and sloppy, but that\'s in the nature of decadence.Harrison Ford, whose career this put the stamp of approval on, is an archaeologist who is recruited to find the Ark of the Covenant hidden somewhere in the Middle East. It\'s 1936 and the Nazis are after it and who knows what havoc they might wreak with its powers? Jones drags along Karen Allen, a former lover and assistant, to provide a pulchritudinous sidekick with whom he can exchange insults. Anything resembling sex is out of the question, though, just as it would never have been considered in one of the 1930s Saturday afternoon theater serials on which this kind of story is based.Here\'s the schematic diagram of the plot: Introduction, suspense, action, suspense, action, suspense . . . n. Then the climax -- a really BIG action scene.But the thing that made it successful and keeps it so enjoyable after thirty years is that the action wasn\'t of the usual sort. Oh, sure, Jones and his girl friend are threatened with immanent death lots of times -- involved in comic fist fights, shot at with poisoned arrows. That\'s de rigeur. But how often does a hero find himself dashing through an underground tunnel downhill pursued by a three-ton rolling marble? Another element that contributed to its appeal was its reconstruction of the period, 1936. The exotic settings of 1936 aren\'t just rebuilt. They\'re lovingly reproduced. The ordinary set dressings are there to suggest the exotic -- always look for beaded curtains -- but the men don\'t waltz around in immaculate double-breasted white suits and pith helmets. The settings are overblown, to be sure. I strongly doubt that in all of Nepal there was a saloon with the size and atmosphere of Karen Allen\'s. I\'m not at all sure there were ANY saloons in Nepal in 1936. But they\'re meant to suggest authenticity, not embody it, and they succeed in an creative way.Finally, the characters are kind of enjoyable in themselves, from the often frightened and only barely willing Indiana Jones himself, through the cartoon Nazis with the monocles and Swastika armbands. Oh, boy, watch the ark of the covenant MELT them down to nothing while they are frozen in place and screaming! The force unleashed.', 'Then they do about an actual good movie. This movie is not good, at least not anymore. I saw this, and the subsequent sequels, in the movie theatre as a kid. I quite enjoyed it. Action, adventure, super-natural elements. It had it all...that is until I watched it again as an adult. It still has action, adventure, and super-natural elements, but what it doesn\'t have is a good script, good acting, good editing, and good flow. My God, the way this movie jumps around is insane. Characters like Sallah had no introduction. None of the characters had an ""arc"", which is fine by me as I don\'t think it\'s a necessity, but they had no depth, which is hard to get past. People complain about movies like John Wick being unbelievable because he gets beat-up, shot, etc., but the same thing happens to Indy. Over and over.I know some people find the introduction of Marion and her line ""I was a child"" a little ""rapey"", but it was a movie made in 1981 set in 1939. Back then, it wasn\'t that rapey. That\'s not what bothered me. What was is that she makes a huge fuss about how it\'s her bar and she worked hard to make it, etc., and when it burns down she\'s just like, whatever. I\'m your shadow now.And then when Indy thinks she\'s dead when the truck just rolls over and explodes (uh, what?), it cuts to Indy drinking with the monkey. The evil monkey that turned her in. Again, what?And then Indy and Sallah just walk all around the Nazi dig site and no one questions them? Even when they find the right place and a crew goes up there and digs, in plain sight, and no one questions them? And then the temple with the snakes. This is supposed to be a temple sealed for like 2000 years, yet somehow all these snakes are surviving? And coming out of a wall? What?Ok, then they get on a boat and a Nazi submarine finds them. Indy hides in a pipe. Then cut to him climbing onto the sub. The sub submerges and travels by map to some Nazi island only to show Indy already out of the water up high? What? Did the sub not go under water? Seems unlikely. Just too convenient.And then the ending is just awful. I thought it was cool as a kid, faces melting, yay, but it just kind of negates Indy\'s journey. He didn\'t do anything to win other than close his eyes. What a cop out. Also, how did he know ""not to look""? Again, convince.I am 47 and looking at this movie again through the lenses and mind of a 47 y/o there were parts that were still enjoyable, but the overall whole of the movie does not stand the test of time.And the irony is I see peole complaining about current movies that suffer from the same issues this movie does, giving them a 1 star rating, yet still give this movie a 10.Like I said, nostolgia holds more importance than an actual good film.', ""This movie has everything: action, a good cast, humor, a wonderful soundtrack (John Williams) a good pace and a good script. I watch this movie like 2 or 3 times a year and it still fascinates me. Thank you for this masterpiece mr. Spielberg! They don't make movies like this anymore!"", ""'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a good film, but nothing more than that for me.Harrison Ford does a sterling job as Indiana Jones, even if his performance does constantly remind me of Steve Martin for some reason. John Rhys-Davies, who I like in James Bond's 'The Living Daylights', fits in well as Sallah. Apart from those two, I don't think any of the others have anything major/memorable about them here - I would've liked to have seen more of Ronald Lacey's Toht.The adventure side is enjoyable, though everything else is missing a spark in my opinion";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The final scene of the movie (will try to avoid spoilers) really questions the ethics of the protagonist. Unlike most reviews I think this is a good thing.

And normally I get tired of reading subtitles but this film just pulls you in and doesn't let to go until the end when the screen fades to black. Yes it's that good! I'm so not a fan of the academy awards but without question this would easily be a contender for an Oscar for best picture. This was truly a fantastic film. Kudos to the entire cast. I mean really. Great work.... everyone."", ""The Promised Land takes place in 1700's Denmark and tells the story of a retired military officer who wants to settle and farm in an inhospitable area where no one else has been able to survive. He has visions of making a great success, and being greatly rewarded by the King and other noble people. That is just the vaguest outline of the story but the film goes deep into the characters involved and becomes unexpectedly dark, much darker than I had imagined. I will not say more so as not to spoil it, but this is a truly great movie. The main character is played to perfection by Mads Mickelson. The associated actors Amanda Collin, Kristine Thorp, and the young child actor Melina Hagberg are very much up to the task of making their characters come alive. A great film that I could not recommend more."", 'Possibly one of the most engaging and powerful European movies of the year. Great storytelling, acting, directing, cinematography, art direction, costumes, make up.This film uses all the tools of the western genre. Wide landscapes, settlers developing harsh lands, the fight against greed, injustice, cruelty and impunity of the ruling class, a stubborn loner who learns to follow his heart and old vs. New technologies, in this case agricultural, settlers fighting rich landowners, racial prejudices and of course a showdown with a powerful obligatory scene.For the longest time I have been waiting for a period piece set in Europe with the look and feel of epic westerns. There have been a few efforts so far and they all failed on me in one part or another. This one could be leading the pack. Do yourself a favor and go see it on a very, very big screen.', 'I\'ve been waiting on this film since it was under preproduction and it was worth the wait. The acting from everyone was fantastic. Mads Mikkelsen went deep into his character and it really showcased his acting skills. He was amazing.It was witty, brutal, beautiful, funny (I give credit to Anders Thomas Jensen for that) and nail biting. It had a great flow to it.Nicolaj Arcel filmed this one and he also did ""A Royal Affair"", but I really can\'t compare the two of them. Two completely different stories. ""A Royal Affair"" had more of romance story attached to it, but this goes a bit deeper and darker.Please do yourselves a favor and see this in the theater if you get a chance. You won\'t regret it!', ""I love Mads' work, ever since i first saw him in a 007 movie, and he always delivers. I'm no movie critic, just a guy that loves to watch a good flick, but Mads always delivers intense performance, no matter be it a comedy or drama. Every character in this movie, as soon as they are introduced on the screen, shows layers and layers of their persona and its just incredible how they do it. Acting, by all of the actors, was absolutely superb! Within first few sentences of a character, you feel like you know their past, what drives them, why are they the way they are etc...just incredible. The whole movie is heavy with emotion you can cut with a knife, and I felt sucked into the story from minute 1. Thats what we need in a movie, engrossing entertainment, great acting and great stories, not agenda pushing. No sub-story here, just good 'ol acting and entertainment."", 'This film is as good as they get and has everything anyone could ever want.

As someone who goes to the cinema a LOT to watch all genres of movies from all over the world I feel I should add that - yes, they are right and i agree - this is the best movie I have seen this year.Treat yourself and go to see it. Magnificent.', 'In my opinion, every single actor in this movie deserves huge credit for trying to bring a horrible script to life. Because of the bad script writing all the characters come across as extremely wooden and/or one dimensional: the silent, determined hero, the proud uncompromising peasant woman, the extremely evil and extremely powerful nobleman, the charming and exotic gypsy girl etc etc. There\'s very little actual development of the characters - the story just jumps a few years and then claims that characters have changed their mindset. Add to this that all the Danish actors talks as if the movie takes place in central Copenhagen in 2023. Curiously, the plot is also extremely similar to classic westerns such as Shane. That\'s not bad thing in itself, though. I would greatly appreciate a Danish 18th century ""western"". The cast could certainly have delivered that - and more - if the script writer and the director had been more honest and ambitious.', 'Anchored by an emotionally arresting performance from the ever-reliable Mads Mikkelsen, The Promised Land (Bastarden) employs the expansive canvas of an epic to narrate its small-scale, intimate human drama and expertly balances the heartwarming with the harrowing to deliver a consistently engaging Jutland western. The story at its core is about family & togetherness yet brewing beneath the surface is an escalating tension that often unleashes scattered scenes of violence when the ambition of a nobody collides with the greed of a madman, thus making this steadily paced & brilliantly crafted Danish historical drama one of the better surprises of 2023.', 'In a pile of all sorts of (mostly bad) films, a film like this emerges, without an agenda, without forced scenes and characters, a real film and a real story, which does not lose its depth and essence from beginning to end. Fantastic movie. Finally, to watch something meaningful. Mads Mikkelsen masterfully portrays an honorable man, consistent in everything, a strong-willed man dedicated to his goal, in which he stronlgy believes, but not because he is arrogant or unrealistic, but because he possesses knowledge and abilities. In addition to being a brave, modest and disciplined man, Ludwig Kahlen is an emotional man who makes essential and human choices, facing great challenges, losses and rewards during his difficult life journey. A historical saga with strong characters, without unnecessary dialogues and with a lot of emotions. Bravo.', ""Great period piece,set in Europe,remincent of American pioneering epics. Beautifully shot , sharp direction and matched with amazing acting. This movie captivated me from the beginning and did not let go till closing credits.I'm not sure how the director managed to tell this story so seamlessly but imagine the artist he was working with had alot to do with it. From Mads to the background actors the movie was perfectly cast. To nail that is a miracle. Also, I usually complain about,not providing enough charactor background, but amazingly I did not need anymore than they gave! I felt emotionally invested.Best Movie I've seen 2023."", 'I loved it, a historical and biographical film full of feelings. A heartbreaking story of a cruel and classist Denmark, which reveals how social classes divide us and bring out the worst in human beings. A character who does not allow himself to be intimidated and undertakes a battle so unequal that he will put not only his life at risk, but also the family of marginalized people that has formed around him. Ludvig Kahlen is an outcast, a bastard who longs for a noble title, a title that is far from giving him happiness and, above all, dignity. A Mads Mikkelsen who perfectly embodies a man devastated by poverty, misunderstanding and disdain for a solitary life. A man who only hopes to live his dream...serve the king!', ""Great acting from Mads Mikkelsen, he is perfect in everything: being James Bond villain and kicking balls, drinking professor with great dancing skills, or growing potatoes on lifeless Utland swamps.No surprise, the whole drama is around whether will potato grow and it's quite boring. A kind of agricultural drama in the middle of nowhere.Mads is good, judge is bad, king is drunk, poor peasant is bitten and punished to death. Oscar worse performance from any point of view with gipsy girl as a little bonus.Making mashed potatoes will never be the same after this great piece of drama with magnificent Mads!"", ""Well as a Dane you sort of have to go see a film directed by Nikolaj Arcel, one of our most successful directors, and starring Mads Mikkelsen our most internationally celebrated actor. Now, in Denmark it's common knowledge that Mikkelsen has a tendency to mumble and can be hard to understand without subtitles, and alass no exception here! I wish I had waited for this to appear on Netflix so I could've turned the subtitles on. But HOW is this even possible? With all the post-production options there are of retaking lines? And Mikkelsen wasn't the only actor allowed to mumble.I also felt that in the direction the actors' choices could have been a lot bolder. And the delivery of lines was often flat and lacking real intention, and real infusion of emotion, as if the director thinks 'flat' equals quiet and intense.All in all pretty damn underwhelming!""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Very underrated, thoroughly enjoyed!"", 'But it is mine.All HUGE heart, loyal friendship and REAL character WITH real characters. And a whole lot of fun and good laughs.Just, love it for what it is.', ""Heath Ledger is Will, a peasant who dreams of being a glorious and great Knight. After the death of his master Will takes on the identity of Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein and enters a tournament were he finds love, friendship and a sense of identity.I'm a little late...well years late at reviewing this but its one of those films you like but never get around to reviewing...I watched this and found it to be quite funny and thrilling. Heath Ledger provides a great performance about a young man striving to grab his dreams and make them a reality, but prevented by rich snobbery. Paul Bettany is marvellous providing the adrenaline pumper that excites the crowd and drives their cheers across the country. His words sway the audience into bettering their English.... and I love his remarks towards the angry Wat.Brilliant feel good movie that drives you to obtain your dreams in one fell swoop."", '""A Knight\'s Tale"" reminded me a lot of ""Shakespeare in Love"", not by storyline, but by mood and whimsy. Here one of the characters is Geoff Chaucer, just in the dawn of his literary career. The story in this film could very well be one of his ""Canterbury Tales"" which somehow he had never gotten into print, as were about 80% of his tales. In fact he mentions using some of his road encounters for future stories. This is a fun, entertaining film, set in the 1370s, but with modern music and, in some cases, dialog.July 2008 edit: I saw it again last night, almost 6 1/2 years after my first viewing. Still a good, entertaining movie. I bought the DVD in memory of Heath Ledger who died a few months ago of prescription drug accidental overdose.SPOILERS AHEAD - Although most of the film is funny, not to be taken too seriously, there are a couple of scenes nearer the end which can easily bring a lump to your throat and tears to your eyes. The first is when William (Heath Ledger) returns to his humble home (Cheapside, London) after 12 years, to see his now blind father. William had ""changed the stars"" by becoming a champion jouster in spite of his non-royal background, and he and his father embrace. The second is nearer the end, after William\'s fraud is exposed, he is thrown in prison, is in the public stocks, subject to the public\'s jeers and veggie toss, when the prince comes forward, recalling their earlier encounter, and knights him.William eventually defeats the dastardly knight, and wins the beautiful Jocelyn, played by first-timer Shannyn Sossamon, a beautiful young girl originally from Hawaii, and a Terri Hatcher look-alike. She has a great screen presence and I predict we\'ll see her, as well as young Heath Ledger, in many more films soon.I saw this on DVD. It is up to the usual high DVD standards, and has a nice collection of very interesting ""extras"", many of them showing the making of the film in the Czek republic. One of the better DVDs, overall. Anyone still watching movies on VHS are for sure living in the ""dark ages"" of home cinema. DVD is so much superior, what more can I say??', ""Wow, A Knight's Tale has over 650 user reviews!!! Such is the testimony of this fine movie that is directed by Brian Helgeland, who also wrote the screenplay for Nightmare on Elm Street 4. One standout performance in my humble opinion is Nick Brimble as Sir Ector. I first saw Mr Brimble as the Prime Minister's security head in House of Cards (the original British one) and he has to be one of the most underrated British actors of our generation. His scene in A Knight's Tale where he takes on a young William Thatcher is a masterclass in acting. It needs to be shown to all aspiring actors, now!"", ""OK, no-one in his right mind will believe this is a historically correct movie. The world tournament games in London, pop-hair make-up, dancing on bowie's golden years, hahaha. There is not much that should be taken too seriously and because it is so clear this movie does not pretend to be historically correct it simply works well. It is written by someone who probably had a lot of fun doing so. All the actors clearly also have fun with the role they are playing and all together is movie is just fun to watch. It is regularly shown on TV and each time again I start with thinking, no lets not watch it but somehow always end up watching it and each time with fun.It is a movie that will never stand-out or get a real cult following, but it is good for an evening feel-good entertainment. Watch and enjoy"", ""I didn't know what to expect, but I really loved this cast and the soundtrack. This is what you call pure fun. Tudyk and Bettany are such a great addition and Heath Ledger has one of those faces you just can't resist. I am glad I finally got to watch this!"", 'This comment is to counter those who have issue with modern rock and other time problems being in this movie. This movie was designed to entertain. It was NOT a historical piece and nowhere does it claim to be one. This is the story of a boy who aspires to be more than what society set out for him. The movie uses odd references to history\'s great figures and humor to bring its story across to the viewer. So I say that, for those of you who cannot enjoy a piece of entertainment due to its well placed use of anachronisms, I strongly suggest you stay away from any of Shakespeare\'s works. (Not to say that this movie was on level with Shakespeare...) The makers of ""A Knight\'s Tale"" set out to entertain, and did so dutifully.', ""While there are some cheesy parts in the script and Shannyn Sossamon while beautiful with a magical smile not quite convincing as the fickle love interest, there is a lot to enjoy. There is constant wit and energy, and the soundtrack is marvellous. The opening scene with We Will Rock You brought the house down when I watched it with my family, and that scene was one of the more exhilarating moments in the film. The dialogue is modern, but there are some flashes of authenticity. One of two of them come across as cheesy but others work surprisingly well. There is a lot going on in the story, sometimes this can be a problem, with the length the film is at nearly two and a quarter hours, my feelings were mixed here. The side story about William's blind father was touching, but for my liking there were too many jousting matches. I will say the acting is very good, with Heath Ledger dashing, Rufus Sewell seedy as the Count and Paul Bettany stealing the show in a wonderfully comic turn as Geoffrey Chaucer. Overall, entertaining and fun, doesn't always work but I liked it. 7/10 Bethany Cox"", 'As soon as I saw the fans singing and clapping to ""We Will Rock You"" I thought ""this is not very realistic"".  Of course, that was when I had gone in expecting a film like Braveheart or The Patriot, with real historical lessons.  A Knight\'s Tale was nothing like either of those. After you get past the first one or two scenes, everything really grows on you.  The humor is, yes, cheesy at times, (the Nike armor) but I still laughed.  Chaucer was great, the villain was definitely evil, and the jousting/action scenes were very well done.  Put all that together with some other funny sidekicks and a little romance and you\'ve got a pretty good flick.  Definitely a must see more than once, and a must buy video/DVD when it\'s out!']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was good to laugh at the movies again. Pedro Pascal and Nick Cage somehow made magic together. An unlikely but very effective duo. Even the action scenes were well done. Awesome cast and stunning location. A hilarious and fun ride.', ""The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. Nicholas Cage movie, about Nicholas Cage and his fight between his artistic aspirations and his chasing of the big bucks as a movie star. In other words there's lots of over acting, lots of action and it's very very clever and funny. A wonderful movie and well worth seeing . 8/10."", ""It's fair to say I haven't always been the biggest fan of Nicholas Cage, but it's not the talent, it's often the film choices, similar to Michael Cain, he really has made some shockers. What this film does however is poke a little fun at his past, it's tongue in cheek, but it's a cracking movie.It's funny, it's energetic, it zips along, there isn't a single dull moment here, you don't need to be a fan or a critic, this movie is just really worth your time.Loaded with irony, it's plain to see that Cage has a sense of humour, this really is a winner for him.It wasn't what I was expected, but I am so glad I went to see it, I'd really recommend it. 9/10."", 'This is one of those self aware comedies and its actually ok in terms of entertainment but thats kind of it. Dont get me wrong, it got a smile here and there and the interaction between the two main characters was fun at times but it had long stretches of boring nothingness. The entire kidnapping arc was a drag and the fact that the movie is aware that its a drag really isnt all that impressive... this has all been done before and I am no longer in high school. So that leaves us with the comedic aspect and thats where if fell short. Again, Cage and more so, Pascal were decent but Laurel and Hardy they are not... not even close.', ""This movie is a blast of entertainment a perfect spoof of Nicolas playing himself with great references, wackiness, and brilliant surprises! A treat for fans or not a The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a well constructed delightful experience. I love how everything plays out if I could be the equivalent of Pedro Pascals character I definitely would I'm a huge fan of Nicolas's films and this one is a ultimate fun! The action is badass, dialogue is well written and hilarious the bulk of the duration."", ""First of all, it is great to see Nick Cage working with such actors like Pedro Pascal who can not only keep up with Cage's screen presence but also enhance it. Secondly, as I have stated in the title, you'll enjoy this experience regardless if you are a fan of the man or not but if you are a fan, then you'll be very glad to see that the film has many nods to Cage's evolving filmography throughout the years. In the end, movie is both a cheesy (and well aware of itself) and a special thing that's not like any other comedy movie."", 'I don\'t see movies in theaters very often, but this looked well worth it. I\'m actually glad I went to the theatre for it because had I paid to stream it or waited for Redbox, I may not have finished it (or may have split it over a couple days). I love Cage, but this was just not as good as the current score here on IMDb (7.8 as I write this) says it is. The high ratings must be from people who can\'t separate the older Nicolas Cage flix from how this movie actually was. Maybe those who want to say he\'s ""back"" - not that he went anywhere - want to rate this higher than it deserves to ensure that he returns to the ""A"" list. It was ok, but lacked something. I liked the alter-ego character of Cage that other reviews say was Sailor from Wild at Heart. Initially I thought it was Randy from Valley Girl. It would have been cool to have a few of his old characters sprinkled in as the alter-egos, but that wasn\'t the case. Overall it was a bit dull and drawn out.', ""Massive disappointment in this film. My own damn fault as I built it up in my head too much. When it was character-centric I enjoyed it a lot more, but the more action and generic it got my interests waned exponentially. Also too much 'hey this cage movie, memba that moments."", '""It\'s grotesque, I\'ll give you $20,000 for it"". That\'s such a Nic Cage moment in a movie about Nic Cage starring um, Nicolas Cage. Oh and there\'s a couple of scenes where Cage sees his Wild at Heart persona as a sort of kooky hallucination. Oh man, that hair.Anyway, Nicolas Cage appears in 2022\'s The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, a rather dry action/comedy in which Cage plays himself (apparently in the same exact way he plays all his other characters). Cage\'s performance is good because well, it\'s no stretch. There\'s the overacting, the crescendo yells, and the massive craziness. This ""cage"" as usual, has been opened up and let loose.Self-parodies and self-deprecation-s begot, ""Talent"" gives the audience those cultural references that any Nic Cage fan could salivate over (like myself). There\'s that famous line, ""why couldn\'t you put the bunny back in the box?"" (from Con Air of course). Then there\'s that ""not the bees!"" quip from The Wicker Man. Finally, there\'s a clip from Guarding Tess that Nic watches solemnly from a TV set in a hotel room. You think taking in The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent would be the ultimate Nic Cage experience but it doesn\'t quite reach that plateau. It\'s almost underwhelming espy if you put it next to his best flicks (Con Air mentioned earlier, The Cotton Club, Face/Off, Leaving Las Vegas).Like I said in the second paragraph, ""Talent"" is billed as an action/comedy. Well there\'s not a whole lot of laughs and the action scenes aren\'t really that bracing (you\'d think with the R rating there\'d be a little more something something). If anything, The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a gimmickry vehicle in the Cage canon, a possible out of the box attempt to jump-start Nicky boy\'s iffy career (he\'s made some questionable stuff in the last couple of decades). Would I recommend ""Talent?"" Probably not. Hey at least it wasn\'t ""unbearable"" after one showing.', ""Caught an advance screening tonight and I thought it was super fun. I'm a huge Nicolas Cage fan, and it was over the top and crazy and chaotic and heartwarming. And there's definitely some cuckoo stuff mixed in, I'm actually a little surprised he didn't take the weirdness even further. And he yelled a lot but I would've taken even more. Haha Definitely a light silly night at the movies :) LONG LIVE CAGE."", '6/10 - after seeing the trailer and hearing the raves out of SXSW, I was expecting the cult classic successor to Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, but sadly this film lacked few if any true punchlines and was quite the slog.', ""Watching this film I was unsure if it was a comedy, a farce, or Nick Cage's personal fever dream, but no matter what it was, I loved it! Clever and compelling, this film weaves a tale that results in laughs both hearty and wry. A+"", 'Nic Cage plays a fictionalized version of himself in an enjoyable action-comedy that also stars a brilliant Pedro Pascal. Writers Tom Gormican and Kevin Etten strike a solid balance between fanboy moments and telling a fairly engaging story. While Cage excels in his dialogue-based humor, Pedro Pascal (who gets nearly equal emotional footing in the story) plays perfect foil to him. The underlying kidnapping plot is something that typically works in a Nic Cage action film, though Cage playing (a version of) himself makes all the difference here. The Easter eggs are organically placed, and the beautiful Spanish locales and production design present themselves as positives. The supporting cast also pitch in when needed, but Cage and Pascal do most of the heavy-lifting from a dramatic and comedic standpoint.', '""Paddington 2"" has a perfect 100 score on Rotton Tomatoes and is the most adored film of all time.This film stars Nicolas Cage is the title role which clues you in to look for irony. Cage is down on his luck and agrees to travel to Spain to meet Javi (Pedro Pascal) a major fan who wants Cage to star in a film for which he has written a screen play. The two start a bromance and then the CIA contacts Cage and informs him Javi is a kidnapper.The film is smartly done especially if you are familiar with the various films done by cage. It seems the French, who loved Jerry Lewis also love Cage. It was an unexpected joy.Looks like I have to add Paddington 2 to my watch list.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.', ""This movie was actually a pleasant surprise.I mean, it's Nicholas Cage. It was so great to see that he knows, what people actually think about him. It was really refreshing. It wasn't breaking the fourth wall like Deadpool, but it was really self-aware and I liked this better TBH.Pedro Pascal was amazing!This two really made something that is thoroughly enjoyable.If you want to see a nice action comedy, which is not stupid, but feel good, with decent plot and good acting - don't look further."", ""Five out of 10 stars is an accurate rating. The lofty reviews and ratings just set you up for disappointment and looking for a refund. I'm not saying don't see it but DO NOT expect a cinematic masterpiece, a knee slapping comedy , a jaw dropping action movie or a really clever idea for a movie.... My pal Gary referenced Tropic Thunder which came closer to hitting the previously mentioned expectations.Take my advice. Don't let your friends blame you for picking this movie. I'm not sure when I'm gonna hear the end of it.Instead...\nI recommend staying home and renting Adaptation if you want to see a movie starring Nick Cage in 2 roles. While you wait for this to hit cable."", 'This is a love letter to Nicholas Cage that I never really saw coming, but left me thoroughly entertained. He is a ton of fun in this movie, fully embracing the off-the-wall concept and sharing a delightful chemistry with Pedro Pascal. A good deal of the film is spent on the aimless conversations between the two, and these scenes are a joy to watch.The story is chock full of goings-on, and while the midsection does sag a bit, I loved the overall vibe and the transparent celebration of Cage\'s ... *checks notes* ... ""nouveau shamanic acting ability"". The marketing for this movie may have been a head-scratcher, but I had a lot of fun with the end product.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.', ""Here comes the sequel to an epic. Steven Spielberg is back and what we get is a mixed bag. I saw it as a kid and naturally loved it. But as we grow older, so do our knowledge and need for probing. Some cast members did not return and weren't even referenced to at all in the story but other aspects in this film make up for it. Jeff Goldblum does reprise his role and I'm quite happy about that. Julian Moore and Vince Vaughn star here, but to me the actor who really caught my eye was Pete Postlethwaite, as Roland. In terms of story this film was definitely built as a thriller. A lot of the story is non-sensible, as I'm sure you've read. The boat somehow guiding itself back to the exact spot where it was destined via no pilot (or maybe auto-pilot\x85), an experienced mercenary on an island full of flesh-eating dinosaurs wandering off just to take a leak, with Juan listening to his MP3 trying to catch a baby dinosaur when I'm sure you heard its enraged father is right behind him\x85eh, the list goes on give or take. Basically this purely a money-shot type of film. We do see a bit of a deeper side to Goldblum's character and that does add a bit of zest to it all. A lot of the other characters are mildly gone into, just barely enough to get a sense of who they are. But suckers like me to this day end up caring for them. Ha-ha Decent characterization at best.Once again a riveting score by John Willams, but in all fairness we get no real time to appreciate it. The SFX of course good as can possibly be, but we established that in the first movie. In America what movie doesn't have good SFX? That's why I don't care when people say Godzilla films SFX are terrible. Because I LOVE dinosaurs I give it a 7.9, around a near B-, but no doubt still a keeper by far. I proudly own the DVD as part of my collection."", 'The Lost World is Steven Spielberg\'s follow up to the innovative Jurassic Park, so how does it\'s sequel measure up by comparison? Well it\'s far better than most have given it credit for. The Lost World is a flawed film, but it\'s a film that set out to be different, and not just a rehash of the previous film, something the newest film in the franchise Jurassic World has done. Many seem to like Jurassic World for how it ""recaptures"" the feel of the original film, but by comparison, comes off as a pale soulless imitation of Jurassic Park.The Lost World however, gets away from the theme park idea, and does something that wasn\'t expected. In The Lost World it is revealed that there was another island called Isla Sorna (Site B) that had dinosaurs that were bred, and raised before being brought to Jurassic Park, on Isla Nublar. The film starts with a wealthy family yachting, and stumble upon Isla Sorna, where their daughter is severely injured by little dinosaurs called Compsognathus that act like land Piranha.Jeff Goldblum reprises his role as Dr. Ian Malcolm, and is summoned by John Hammond for reasons unknown. Ian Malcolm is still a sarcastic character, much like he was in Jurassic Park, but his character is visibly different after the events of Jurassic park, he rarely laughs, or smiles, and Ingen has made Ian a laughing stock, after trying to create public awareness after what happened to him at the park. Hammond is also losing his credibility, after the incident at Jurassic Park, and Ingen has taken control away from Hammond, and given it to his arrogant nephew, named Ludlow, who Malcolm has clashes with.Hammond tells Malcolm that he has been trying to preserve Isla Sorna, and protect it from human interference, but implies that the island is in danger of being pillaged for it\'s assets. Hammond say\'s public opinion could keep exploiters from removing the dinosaurs, but that in order to gain such support, a photo record must be obtained, which means sending people in to research, which Ian immediately disapproves of. This is until he finds out that his girlfriend, Sarah Harding a Paleontologists, has already gone to the island. This gives Malcolm as reason to go to a place he would rather never revisit again, as this dinosaur island has no fences of any kind, and the dinosaurs are free roaming.Ian arrives to the island with two other companions Eddie Carr, a field equipment expert, and Nick Van Owen, a video documentarian as well as Malcolm\'s daughter Kelly (a unneeded character) who sneaks aboard the ship in one of the team\'s vehicles. Soon they find Sarah, and come across a herd of Stegosaurus, where Sarah has a close encounter when she gets to close to an infant Stegosaurus. The Lost World focuses a great deal on the nurturing habits of dinosaurs, which expands upon the first film, which tried to portray dinosaurs not only as movie monsters, but as animals. This film carries that idea further, and delves into how these animals act in a more naturalistic environment. The T-Rex\'s also have an infant, that gets injured by Ingen\'s team. Sarah, and Nick repair the baby\'s leg, but when the T-Rex\'s show up, they\'re less than appreciative, and wreck the trailers/vehicles, believing they have to defend their territory further. This forces Malcolm, and his companions to join forces with Ingen\'s team headed by Ludlow, but lead by Roland Tembo, played by the late Pete Postlethwaite. Of course since both teams have different agenda\'s this leads to conflict. Regardless they come together to try and reach a communication center to get off the island. Of course along the way dinosaurs show up, resulting in casualties. After the group gets separated by the T-Rex\'s, Roland tranquilizes the male T-Rex. Ludlow then want\'s to bring it to San Diego, where a facility has been built to house the dinosaurs, since the dinosaurs captured earlier were released by Sarah, and Nick. This is where many people are left divided, some liking the T-Rex running around San Diego, and some hating it.There\'s no denying that the way the T-Rex gets to the mainland isn\'t well executed, and makes little sense. It also may feel tacked on because it was, the original ending was different, but Spielberg felt the The Lost World needed a bigger ending, just as he did with Jurassic Park. While it may seem out of place, the entire film teases the idea of bringing dinosaurs back to the mainland. Malcolm, and Sarah find the infant T-Rex that was also brought back, and use it to lure the adult T-Rex, back to the cargo hold of the ship, where they both could be contained, and be brought back to the island. Not before the T-Rex causes some dino-damage down the streets of San Diego, which admittedly is neat to see. The Lost World isn\'t as good as Jurassic Park, but it isn\'t as bad as critics, and ""fans"" alike have made it out to be. The Lost World has it\'s issues, such as underwritten plot elements/characters, and unneeded characters like Malcolm\'s daughter Kelly, but also has a strong cast/performances, and the effects are even more believable looking than in the first film. The animatronic dinosaurs looked even more convincing in The Lost World, especially the T-Rex\'s that had subtle changes made mechanically, making them much more lifelike. The CGI is also impressive, especially during the Compsognathus sequence that required the animation of several little dinosaurs. John Williams provides another great score for The Lost World, adding more tribal melodies to go with the mood, and look of the film. The Lost World may not be Spielberg\'s best film, but it\'s hardly his worst, and it\'s a decent, well made followup to a film that never really needed one.', 'Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned...Good sequel has equally effective F/X and terrifying story, though a few too many characters";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much and I have fun watching it so much. I have to talk about this movie: It is one man army fighting against a team of terrorists with automatic weapons and plastic explosives. Bruce Willis performance was excellent in this movie John McClane is his best role ever. It is my number 1 personal favorite action movie of all time, I love this movie to death! It\'s stay in my heart forever. To me it felt this film realistic and it makes you think that you are alone trapped in a building against bunch of terrorists what will you do? This film has heart and soul. A lot of movies have try to do that premise since, but no movie has nail it like ""Die Hard."" This is a modern day action film of the action genre. I watch this film as a teenager I even watch it with my mom it was ultimate thrill ride. I love everyone in here all the characters and the lead character. I love that McClane is alone he has no help, all telephones doesn\'t work he is barefoot with his gun and the only help has is from Sgt. Al Powell down there who didn\'t even see him at all but were both talking on a radio from cop to cop. I love that bond between those two lead heroes. I always love when McClane talks to himself whenever he was about to do something crazy. It is going to be 30 years anniversary this summer 20th July. I love this film to death I am hugh fan of Die Hard films I love this film so damn much. I would really love to see this movie in a widescreen in a movie theater. It was directed by brilliant John McTiernan it is is based on a novel Roderick Thorp Nothing Lasts Forever. This is a masterpiece action film that started all action genre one man army types battling terrorists while trapped in a confined space. It was arguably the first one in the action genre. This movie has everything . It has intense Action, Drama, Thriller, twists, great dialogue, explosions, fights. Exploding building, great helicopter explosion action scenes. John McClane is one man against a whole team of terrorists. A cracking Action Thriller from beginning to end, Die Hard explodes with heart-stopping suspense! It has great cast, great plot, great explosions, no shaky cam, doesn\'t deal with CGI, but real actions real practical effects. Great Direction from John McTiernan, great dialogues, great acting from everyone. Everyone does an excellent job. Bruce Willis is a bad ass action star as John McClane. It has a great bad-ass action hero who does impossible buy stopping the terrorists who were actually a real terrorists who try to steal the money in a vault 640.000.000$ in bearer bonds stored in the building\'s vault. My favorite action sequences and the best part of Die Hard: McClane grabs the fire hose, ties it around his body jumps with the helicopter about to kill him. Then Gruber blows it a second after McLane jumps off the roof! It was an incredible explosion that totally takes out the helicopter. But McLane is falling down the side of the building and needs to get inside quickly this is the best scene in the movie my favorite. McClane climbs in the elevator shaft escapes Karl and his men trying to kill him. McClane shoots on the table with his gun killing Marco. (According to the director, the proximity of the gun to Willis\' ear during this scene caused permanent hearing loss for Willis.) \nMcClane shot\'s Hans and Eddie ""Happy - Trails, Hans..."" Incredibly satisfying action in a brilliant action movie! McClane try to save Ellis when Ellis try to save him self. McClane was afraid of flying and he always carry gun because he was afraid someone would have hijack it. The fight between Karl and John was excellent and well choreographed. McClane drops C4 down the elevator shaft and destroys the entire floor where the terrorists are firing from, giving the cops a chance to retreat. I love The broken glass scene. He shoot\'s and kills two terrorists with his machine gun to escape Hans and Karl, John McClane is forced to sprint over broken glass while barefoot the best bad-ass scene in the movie my all time favorite. Three terrorists are shooting on McClane on the roof chasing him in which he escapes in the beginning of the movie awesome. Karl shoots in an elevator shaft in which McClane is hiding a real kick-ass scene I love this film to death! I love the characters in this movie: John McClane a real action hero to me that does something that no one can he stops a team of terrorists. Hans Grubar the German mastermind he was ruthless and brilliant and he would do anything to steal the money even killing people and get what he want\'s. Alan Rickman\'s performance was excellent I love him to death in this movie. I really miss the actor he was the best villain of the whole world. The LAPD Supervisor (Diana James) I like that girl she was so good when McClane call\'s her for help, I love it. I love Sgt. Al Powell how he stand\'s up and defends McClane against his supervisor. Reginald VelJohnson does a brilliant performance as a great supporting hero in this movie. I love Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson to death he is my favorite character in here. Paul Gleason was so good I love his performance - ""kick ass."" I love how he tried everything to safe the hostages including SWAT team who were badly hurt. I like Richard Thornburg in this movie who is annoying reporter but I still like it. Bonnie Bedelia as Holly McClane\'s wife was great.John McTiernan directed excellent this masterpiece Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza wrote a script that it delivers. The helicopters in here were models in this movie delivered, to me the action scenes felt realistic. This movie has ton\'s of action and you never get bored with it. Michael Kamen made a music score and you never get bored with it. You\'ll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you\'ll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody rated R with real blood squibs. 10/10 it is my favorite action film in the action genre I love this film to death it is my personal action favorite film. I miss movies like this I miss action movies like this one today I want them back. It is a shame we don\'t have movies like this today.', ""Of course the Action Genre existed before Die Hard. After all you had The Terminator, Commando, Top Gun, Roadhouse...but didn't Die Hard absolutely revolutionize the eighties action Genre. It came like a savior and encompassed everything that would blow you right out the back of the theater and made Bruce Willis an absolute idol in the Action world and for good reason. Die Hard had pointless nudity, scores of bad language, bloody death, guns, explosions, a gritty, tough as nails, sweating, dirty hero that takes on everyone with nothing more than a hand gun and his brains. If you watch Willis in Die Hard it's a thing of beauty. His shirt torn off, bare foot, wounds all over him...he looks like he just crawled from a war rather than stalking terrorists through an enormous high rise office building in L.A. The script was so dead on...it was basic, it was to the point, it has great sarcastic humor and one liners that could never be forgotten. And Willis was the man to pull it all together. Add a decent supporting cast, a guy on the ground who is like his partner and a MacGyver style of killing bad guys that will go down in history...THIS IS DIE HARD.Bruce Willis was brought up right in the Prime of his TV Series Moonlighting where his irresistible charm and personality made him a hit. John McLean was David Addison but with a lot more guts and a lot more ammo. That only made the film more exciting to fans of Willis already. Willis has a way of just making everything edge of your seat and everything believable. Who else could make you smile in fear when he's diving out of a 30 story window attached to a fire hose while the roof of the building is exploding. He really doesn't single handedly make the film...the supporting cast is terrific. Bonnie Bedelia is great as McLean's straight laced, professional and estranged wife. They make an odd yet touching couple. They have some electricity and it's ironic and yet sensible that they don't end up together throughout the series. Still Bedelia is a great female lead and her character is strong and not at all misused in the role. Alan Rickman is just one kick ass bad guy. Can you say anything else?? As terrorist Hans Gruber he is terrifying, evil, brilliant, and you just despise him and you can't wait to see him go up against Willis and he does. He doesn't stand a chance but Rickman is still brilliant as the bad guy. Reginald VelJohnson plays a small yet very important role as Willis' guy on the ground on the other end of a walkie talkie. They don't know each other, and barely know each other's name but yet they become as close as partners and they too are odd together and yet fit. William Atherton has to be mentioned even though it's a very small role, it's Die Hard history that he plays slimy, tabloid reporter Richard Thornburg who gets his just end by Holly McLean's fist which becomes a running joke in the series.Die Hard is everything that people would look at in disgust now in the new millennium and yet it was everything the eighties stood for when it came to action and heroes. McLean has a cigarette dangling from his mouth, blood pouring everywhere, and a happy ending despite all the destruction around them. If you haven't seen Die Hard you can't ever proclaim yourself an action fan because Die Hard IS action. It's the film every action film strives to live to and will never meet...whether it was before 1988 or after. We won't ever get something like this again. It's an absolute 100% classic!! for all the wrong reasons!! 10/10"", ""Worth watching from the golden area of moviesYou won't regret it"", 'Every Christmas, there are 2 movies that I have to watch: ""National Lampoon\'s Christmas Vacation"" and ""Die Hard"".Every guy that I talk to about this agrees that ""Die Hard"" is a classic Christmas movie.

When John does get to his destination, it\'s a good-old-fashioned Christmas office party... everyone is in good spirits and sharing some cheer.Sure, there\'s lots of killing later in the movie, but that doesn\'t take away from the Christmas feeling that I always have when I watch this movie.If you celebrate Christmas and you haven\'t yet incorporated this movie into your Christmas ritual, do so this year.', ""Yup. That's the title I'm giving this short review. Nothing else comes to mind that would do it more justice.

It's not perfect. It's got its flaws. But to hell with those, this is just too much fun to not be watched, and even if you're the intellectual kind, if you like cinema, check this out as it is a lesson on how to make a campy, action-filled thriller the right way. It's a bit long, and yeah the relationship with the black cop is a bit rushed during the ending scene... but the cunning intelligent villain is here, vs the anti-hero, guns, big explosions, the cops, the mischievous lines Willis delivers...this is fun man.

As straight as he plays it, there's a manic energy to the proceedings that others in this genre can't match. With Christopher Lloyd and RZA."", ""I've been patiently waiting for this film to come out streaming without a fee, and HBO Max has stepped up to the plate. When I saw it in their menu this morning I didn't have to waste time choosing what to watch. I enjoyed Bob Odenkirk in 'Breaking Bad' and 'Better Call Saul', but knew his role here had to be entirely different based on the previews and trailers. Quite simply, the movie is a blast, and even though I usually qualify these kinds of flicks by saying no one could possibly pull off the things Odenkirk's character does here, it's just too much of an adrenaline rush to see how he puts away bad guy after bad guy.Following an opening sequence in which Hutch Mansell (Odenkirk) appears to have wimped out during a home invasion, the story line gradually reveals his dark past as an 'auditor' for the government's three letter agencies. Retiring when he had enough, his life eventually mellowed out as a family man in a stale marriage and a daily routine that would sap the energy of most. But then, when he found out his daughter's kitty cat bracelet went missing during the home assault, the old itch returned, and Hutch goes on a mission that lands him smack dab against a Russian mob enforcer (Aleksey Serebryakov) with a penchant for making the night club scene at the gangster owned Obshak.The story is predictable enough. I knew for example, that hidden voice Harry (RZA) would eventually make an appearance, and there was something about Christopher Lloyd's role as Hutch's Dad David that made it feel like there was more to his character than a mere nursing home resident. During the gun battle at the warehouse, the film makers threw in a great sight gag when Hutch erased the number of days without a lost time accident (204). Technically, he didn't have to do that, because what was going on was no accident, but it did provide a bit of humor amid the violence. I also thought the choice of songs in the soundtrack were a perfect laid back complement to the mayhem on screen. 'I've Gotta Be Me' epitomized what Hutch Mansell was all about, while 'What a Wonderful World' and 'You'll Never Walk Alone' were also suitably placed. My son, who watched this film a couple times on separate occasions didn't care for the older tunes, and could only relate to 'Heartbreaker' during the car chase.

Unfortunately Marshall didn't contribute the script, which is undoubtedly the weakest thing about this generic offering, and despite copious amounts of his trademark gore and bloodshed, this is a film that doesn't amount to much. Ron Perlman didn't come back either, and David Harbour is a weak imitation, his Hellboy lacking singularly in charisma and feeling more like a heavy metal band member more than anything else. The film offers endless spectacle and action heavily dominated by CGI effects, but the mish-mash of plot and forced humour, while watchable, doesn't have the same love and care that went into the two prior films. Put it this way: I can happily re-watch either of those, but I won't be re-watching this one."", ""During the time of Camelot, King Arthur dismembers the evil Nimue (Milla Jovovich) and his knights carry the remains to far off hiding places. In the present day, Hellboy (David Harbour) is battling evil under the command of his adoptive father Trevor Bruttenholm (Ian McShane). Alice Monaghan (Sasha Lane) is a close companion on the team who has clairvoyant powers. Team member Ben Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim) distrusts Hellboy and takes mysterious injections.All the fun seems to have been drained from the franchise. Everyone is playing a singular tone of sarcasm and anger. There is plenty of splatter as the movie seems to be leaning towards the horror genre. It's not horror in terms of being scary. It's horror in terms of having some of the visual language without the effects. The story telling is rather flat. I expected this to be a scavenger hunt for the parts of Nimue but that's not the case. It becomes a series of events and battles with sound and fury signifying nothing."", ""Even though some critics thought it might. Now this had a bad standing from the beginning. And while the actors are quite nice and the R-rating was secured (something fan boys really wished for), it did not make nearly as much money as it was supposed to. Or rather as much as the producers and the studio hoped for overall.And while this is layed out to warrant sequels, this probably won't happen. And it's almost a shame, because it isn't at all bad. The effects are good, the new Hellboy managed to stay afloat (which is quite an achievement if you think about the shoes he had to fill - or is it the horns?) - the story made sense too. But I guess there is a comic book fatigue to a degree. There are so many movies out there, that people pick and choose. Maybe there were other reasons too, but in the end it doesn't really matter ... speaking of endings: there is one mid credit scene and one after credit scene. So if you watch it, watch it proper"", ""Story was rushed, very little character development, and the climax was disappointing. They should have funded a 3rd Guillermo del Toro movie instead.

The source material is SO rich, but they only skimmed the surface of it, focusing on broad ideas so much that I couldn\'t really care about any of the characters or even the fate of humanity. The writing is bad and feels like a Jr. High boy\'s creative writing assignment, full of fantastic concepts that have all been done before. There\'s a lot of explaining about past events and scene setup that should come from situations and dialog, but instead is given to us in a ""Oh yeah, forgot to tell you..."" fashion. Then there was the editing... Scenes were mishmashed together to tell the story loosely. I\'m not an editor, but I even noticed scenes that would have been better left out or rearranged in a different order.

There's almost nothing to like or admire about this compared to the great 2 previous hell-boy movies directed by the great Guillermo del Toro.

The horde (audience) wins over the others who appreciate really good things I guess!!!"", ""First the bad and they aren't that bad. 1) While David Harbour does a pretty good job as Hellboy. But he lacks the natural charm that Ron Perlman had in the title role. Not to say that there aren't times that he comes off prefect for the part. 2) It is a well made film. But it doesn't have the spit and polish that Guillermo del Toro put into his film duo. One the good side Neil Marshall and the writers stayed true to the story Hellboy. The role of the big bad was beautifully played by Milla Jovovich (fair warning on this part I have been nursing a 20 + year crush on her). Daniel Dae Kim and Sasha Lane were great in their roles of Domino and Alice. They add a little more depth to help flesh on the new world created for the film. And the adding of Church as Lobster Johnson was great. On a whole it was a solid film. If you like modern fantasy, and want to move away from the Marvel/DC fight of which is the better superheroes. You could do worse than Hellboy."", ""I really like the character of Hellboy with his little John McClane side, i.e. « I did not ask to be here, but as I am stuck here, please let me smash them all, one by one, just to have a little fun », and the dark atmosphere. The soundtrack is punchy and punk rock. At last, the Computer Generated Imagery is globally successful. For now: that's heavy! Nevertheless, the story is so predictable and terribly far-fetched. In short: desperately annoying. It's really an uninterrupted series of dismemberments, decapitation and eye-gouging delights during manifold battles against apocalyptic monsters. These scenes are strung together at a blistering pace for one disappointing purpose: make you forget an incoherent script full of moronic plot twists.

I was entertained."", ""I love the Hellboy comics, the novels, the short stories, all of it. Hands down my favorite comic book character ever written, and not likely to change.They got a few things right, fair credit where its due. The Hellboy in Mexico story was spot on and well done, Daimio and Gruagach were both fairly accurate, and the Baba Yaga's chicken leg house was just about perfect. They NAILED the Osiris Club and the Wild Hunt, which got a huge smile from me.But... Man, the rest of it? Why is Hellboy suddenly at odds with the Professor, who is suddenly a foul-mouthed monster hunter? Why rewrite the details to the origin? Why so dramatically change Alice?The sad fact is that this movie tried to do WAY too much in adapting The Storm and the Fury, which is essentially the climax of the entire Hellboy saga. There are too many moving pieces to that story, too many callbacks to previous stories, and truthfully its way too big a scope to try and cram into one story, even if the script and director were up to the challenge. And unfortunately they were not. The story is all over the place and rushed, the dialogue is really hackneyed in spots, and overall it just ends up a mess.David Harbour really does a great job in making Hellboy his own take on the character, but the script does him no favors in giving him very little room to work.

""Titanic"" was a long movie that was as exactly as long as it needed to be. ""Gone with the Wind"" was a really long movie that was exactly as long as it needed to be. ""Dances with Wolves"" was a long movie that I wish had been even longer when I saw it in the theater. But ""King Kong""? Phhewww...this sucker clocks in at least 30-60 minutes longer than it needs to be. While it played, I kept inadvertently thinking to myself, ""Boy, we really should be out to sea by now...they haven\'t reached the island yet?...man, are they EVER gonna find Ann?...jeez, when are we gonna go back to Manhattan already?..."" and so on. Hand to God--I actually yawned twice during the last third of this movie. I even closed my eyes for a second before I realized, \'hey...you can\'t just rewind this when you wake up!\'Sure, many scenes in ""King Kong"" were thrilling (e.g., LOVED the T-Rex sequence) and, yes, I even teared up a little a couple of times. And I must say, Kong himself was beautifully realized--he looked and acted like a REAL gorilla (albeit a tiny bit anthropomorphized)! But I gotta tell you...I was more relieved than exhilarated when this movie ended. (If I saw one more flyover of the native village, I was gonna scream!) Peter...baby...why spend so much time developing all these extraneous secondary characters if you don\'t really have much closure with them by the end. For example, the ship\'s captain and Jimmy...once we leave Skull Island...pfffftttt...we never them again. Why all the backstory scenes about them? As with the original version, Jackson should have concentrated simply on the four main characters throughout: Kong, Ann, Driscoll and Denham. Period.The problem is Jackson tried to make an epic out of a thriller, when these two approaches are generally exclusive to each other. The original ""Kong"" MOVED because it was simply a thriller and content to be so, but Jackson\'s remake starts and stops, and starts and stops, and starts and stops, merely frustrating the thrillseeker in us that wants to keep going every time Jackson establishes some momentum. But instead Jackson pauses to ""delve"" or ""explore"" or ""elaborate"" a la David Lean or something like that. One can excuse Jackson for shooting so much material for the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy--consider the rich source material . But how anyone could have taken the 100-minute original and nearly doubled it for a remake has far too much memory on his Mac. He should have saved all the extra footage (and I\'m betting there\'s a LOT more we didn\'t see in the theatrical cut) for the DVD release as he did for LOTR. Mr. Jackson\'s first priority as a filmmaker (well, all filmmakers) is to present the most appropriate cut for THEATRICAL audiences during the film\'s initial exhibition in theaters. In this case, more WAS less. Much shorter movies in the past have had intermissions!Honestly, though I certainly enjoyed ""King Kong"", I really have no desire to see this movie again--I just couldn\'t bring myself to sit through all the filler just to get to the good parts. How I wish Jackson and/or Universal would consider releasing a 2-hour DVD version. Hey, it\'s happened before, so what\'s the harm? Inside of a year there\'ll be 17 versions out on DVD anyway...what\'s one more? But having to sit through a 3-4 hour DVD version someday? I\'ll take a pass.Do I recommend seeing ""King Kong""? Of course. You\'ll probably enjoy it immensely, despite it\'s overlength. But if you do go, by all means lay off the Jumbo Coke until at least 90 minutes in! You\'ll thank me later.', ""Just want to comment on some of the jungle scenes where the crew gets attacked by insects: These scenes make Alien look like sesame street! I'm not prissy, but that was truly repulsive and had nothing to add to the movie.In Germany, this movie is rated suitable for children age 12 or older - I don't want to know how many of them had (or still have) nightmares.Apart from that, it really was a nice movie...But I still can't see why this much of violence and gore had to find its way into the movie. Next time I'd like to see either less gore or a clearer rating."", 'WETA has once again raised the bar in CGI. With the arrival of Peter Jackson\'s King Kong, we\'ve come to a point where CGI can be 100% believable throughout the film. During the action-packed 3 hours you don\'t even stop to think ""wow, that\'s some good CGI"", but instead you recognize Kong as a personality. I\'m talking about the real star of the movie, and that should not come as a surprise. Naomi Watts is indeed an excellent Ann Darrow, Jack Black fits in Carl Denham\'s boots superbly, and Adrien Brody isn\'t half bad as Jack Driscoll. But, the star is Kong himself... and of course the man \'behind the mask\', Andy Serkis. The realization of this giant gorilla is nothing short of perfect. In fact, the only CGI in the movie that\'s not amazing hasn\'t got to do with Kong.Peter Jackson has turned this classic story into a slam-bang spectacle, with more action than many could\'ve predicted. King Kong is also way more emotional than I personally expected. Ann Darrow\'s relationship with Kong is depicted in a superior way to the original movie. Despite the unbelievable stop-motion effects in the original, I always thought Kong lacked in persona. Well, that has changed. The audiences will have no trouble seeing what Kong\'s going through, and those eyes of his are probably the saddest sight in any movie this holiday season.While being a loud and big popcorn-movie, King Kong succeeds in reinstating the original magic related to this tale, and is surely going to be a huge worldwide hit, that\'s best viewed on silver screen. I don\'t think many people could expect anything more from this movie than what it is : a professionally crafted, impressive piece of commercial cinema.', 'First off, let me say that I\'m a huge Peter Jackson fan. I loved the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy, and consequently, I was really looking forward to seeing this film, too. Unfortunately, my admittedly high hopes were not fulfilled.On the plus side, and most importantly, Jackson does an amazing job of portraying Kong both as a wild beast and a caring, compassionate creature. Hence, the end is particularly powerful and touching, and I truly did sympathize with Kong and feel his tragedy. In fact, I was in tears.On the downside, however, the film has a number of big problems.First of all, the film is too long. Jackson and his cohorts (Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) spent too much time trying to build up a multitude of characters (namely, the shipmates) who, ultimately, don\'t matter much, and whom you really end up not caring about, despite all the time spent on their development. Focusing instead on the handful of main characters would have allowed at least a half hour of the film to be trimmed from its needlessly bloated 3 hour length.Secondly, the action scenes are so over-the-top that they become absurd. Painfully absurd. If you\'re familiar with the Lord of the Rings films, then recall Legolas\' single-handed downing of the Mumakil in ""Return of the King."" It was a fun scene, but it stretched the bounds of plausibility, almost winking at the audience in acknowledgment of its self-indulgence. Now, imagine that scene amplified ten-fold in both length and brazenness, and that\'s the kind of nonsense in Kong that had me rolling my eyes, and that had the audience around me audibly groaning.Compounding the absurdity of the action scenes was the total disregard for plausibly in scripting the actions of the scenes\' main participants: the creatures. Simply put, animals just don\'t behave as idiotically as they do in this movie. I\'m no zoologist, but I\'m confident that a predator with its mouth full of a huge dinner does not bother to chase after additional prey, especially when it\'s a mere fraction of the size of its current meal. Moreover, a large herd of gigantic beasts doesn\'t stampede away from a handful of predators that are comparatively minuscule in scale. For that matter, beasts that gigantic simply don\'t stampede, period";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The two films that come to mind, obviously, are ""Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight"" with Billy Zane (rated a 6.6/10 here) which tackled the whole ""end of the world/standoff in diner/lone hero fighting alongside the little guys against a legion of bad guys"" thing 10 times better and ""The Prophecy"" with Christopher Walken (also rated a 6.6/10 here) which tackled the whole ""good angel versus bad angel/showdown on earth"" thing 10 times better. Both came out in 1995 and while they didn\'t have the special effects that this one had, they had a cohesive story, GREAT acting and believable characters.The internet is going to crucify this film, so I\'m just going to break it down simply: The first hour or so is pretty good, and if it had stopped at the 70 minute mark, it could come close to the 6.x rating it\'s getting now. The last 30 minutes is a rushed, hatchet job that will make you regret seeing this film. Also, SHAME on the editors of the film trailer for spoiling the two best scenes of the film (the old lady ""reveal"" and the ice cream man ""reveal"".) I hate when you do this. You stole all of the impact those scenes had and lowered my rating by a point.Don\'t pay to see this film, rent ""The Prophecy"" and ""Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight"" instead.', 'I\'m not sure what most of these people writing bad reviews wanted out of this film......were they expecting some religious aspect of the whole ""apocalypse"" genre or something?anyway, Legion is a movie you either love or hate, no doubt about it, but it sure as Heaven (cough) doesn\'t deserve the bad reviews.1. the gfx weren\'t bad, or too much, they were there to show what they had to and thats it.2. this movie isn\'t JUST action and blood and guts, it had a story and i liked the writers idea to pause the fighting after the first wave of the possessed to dwell a little more into the emotions of the characters 3. bad acting? not really, while Micheal might have had better lines he still accomplished his role. 4. some parts were funny like ""they aren\'t our regular customers"", why you ask? well the look on his face was ""i cant believe I\'m saying this"", which any NORMAL person would think at such a sentence. 5. GOD was portrayed as a human, with a heart and a mind that contradict each other, also he was depressed, people might say this was a bad decision but i think it is correct, since humans are the image of god (according to believers he made us like him) 6. YOU SAW WHAT YOU WERE EXPECTED TO SEE, there are no plot holes!! because the director wanted you to see just this, and nothing more, if other people could understand this they might also understand the whole plot. 7. here is a hypothesis so you understand the baby\'s role. the baby was the second coming, and since god was angry at humans he didn\'t want to give them a second chance to survive, now since Jesus became god it would mean the baby becomes god in the end (of his life), thus bringing with him his happiness and love for humans... so humanity survives....i could go on, but it\'ll take all night so in short:Legion is a movie that you have to see without expecting it to be the movie of the year, and over analyze every damn second of it. go watch it ONLY for entertainment and to kill an hour or so I\'m not a fan of any of the actors or the director but i watched this movie with a free mind and i enjoyed it', ""This is going to be a tough review to write. The reason I say that is because Legion for all intents and purposes is not a good film. Its ridiculous, preposterous, with plot holes the size of cannon balls. You could pick this film apart until there was nothing left of it but angel wings and dirt. So here is the thing. Legion was incredibly entertaining! The action was wicked and intense, the characters were fun and intriguing, it was gory and action packed so despite everything else I had fun. You basically have to let go of everything to go into this film. And some people can do that because a movie is not always art, or full of message and morality, a film can also just be absolutely nothing but entertain and for me Legion did exactly that. Upon retrospect of the film you'll start to realize the startling amount of errors and plot holes but I think a movie should be reviewed mostly on its first impression like when you're sitting in the theater. The unfortunate side to the film is that it misses the incredible potential of this epic good vs evil battle by making the story rather convoluted and underusing the characters of Michael and Gabriel.Paul Bettany is a great actor and very versatile. I think the film makers of Legion were lucky to have him. He is brooding, and strong and commanding as the rogue angel Michael. Even being a leading character they underuse him and we really don't get to see enough of his action. Lucas Black is naive and simple Jeep Hanson. In a normal film he would likely become the hero but when you've got an Angel to contend with you take a backseat and unfortunately that is where his performance is pushed to. He does well but is overshadowed in a big from the other actors in the film. That includes Dennis Quaid as Black's father. I love Quaid and this is no exception. Its a small role but he takes it and makes it his own and really commands the screen. Adrianne Palicki is the lead female who is basically the cause of this angelic war. Palicki is very underused because I think she could have given a really strong performance if she had been given the chance but like Black she takes a back seat. The cast is also boosted by some amazing supporting performances by Charles S. Dutton and Kevin Durand who should have also been used more. Also worth mentioning is solid supporting roles from Kate Walsh, Jon Tenney, and Willa Holland.Some might also go into this movie figuring it to be an epic battle between good and evil, Angels and Demons, further proved by the name of film, Legion being a horde of demons that possess someone in the bible. Instead this is about a battle from Heaven between Angels not even fallen Angels. The special effects are solid and even breath taking at times. The film also reeks of being Stephen King-esquire which in my opinion is one of the highest compliments. King could have put this together much much better but it has the twisted religious overtones, the isolation of a desert gas bar, and even the vivid characters. So for all of you that love to be simply entertained and want a thriller, action, even part horror film then absolutely treat yourself to Legion and avoid trying to pick it apart. It's a solid action trick. 7.5/10"", ""Judging from the trailer this movie was supposed to be a whole lot of action while the talking takes a backseat, unfortunately the 30 second trailer contained all the action you are going to see over 100 minutes of the full movie.The acting was entirely melodramatic while the script was TV level. Nothing was believable, far too often you found yourself watching these characters talk to each other, explaining their own background while you sit there realizing that you don't care at all. The character development was done so obviously that it made everything feel cheap.Avoid this movie at all cost's, you'll have more fun reading a Bible than you would watching Legion."", 'It often pains me, after seeing a film I consider perfectly watchable, to come to IMDb and find the majority of reviews ripping it apart. Though this is by no means a masterpiece it is an enjoyable, well structured film with good acting, good scripting and a solid plot. I\'ve seen lots of people complaining that the last quarter is a weak point and though I can see the argument it still does run everything back together nicely. There are some weird points not fully explained (SPOILER: the prophetic tattoos on Jeeps arm?) and I do find the level of character death-rate slightly too high. Yet I finished the film feeling it had made its point: humanity is basically scum but with redeeming features, nothing too high brow or original but valid none the less. I didn\'t find the acting or lines overly cheesy or strained as others have said";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Jurassic World;2015;Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi;6.9;PG-13;59;Colin Trevorrow;Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Ty Simpkins, Judy Greer, Irrfan Khan, Vincent D'Onofrio, Nick Robinson, Jake Johnson, Omar Sy, BD Wong, Lauren Lapkus, Brian Tee, Katie McGrath, Andy Buckley, Eric Edelstein, Courtney James Clark, Colby Boothman, Jimmy Fallon;A new theme park, built on the original site of Jurassic Park, creates a genetically modified hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus Rex, which escapes containment and goes on a killing spree.;"['You may have heard some critics champion Jurassic World as ""The best Jurassic Park sequel"", some fans declare that it ""brought them back to their childhood"", and others who may have made the absurd claim, ""It\'s better than the original"". Don\'t believe the hype. Jurassic World is nowhere close to the best Jurassic Park sequel (Spielberg\'s own, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, will always have that title). It is not going to bring you back to your childhood, and it doesn\'t hold a candle to what Steven Spielberg and crew accomplished with the original Jurassic Park. That being said, in a time of dark, self-serious, and pretentious blockbusters such as last year\'s Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or Christopher Nolan\'s Dark Knight films, Jurassic World is a refreshing antidote. Light, wholesome, and heavy on adventure, JW harkens back to the big Hollywood ""event"" blockbusters of the 80s and 90s. Let\'s just not pretend this is anything groundbreaking. The fourth Jurassic Park movie remembers to have fun with its premise, but Spielberg\'s magic touch is still sorely missed.Jurassic World is the latest film in the Jurassic Park franchise in name only. Call it a sequel, reboot, or re-quel, the fact remains, this is not the same world created by author Michael Crichton and made real by Spielberg and company in 1993. All the major characters from the first three films are gone. Alan Grant, Ellie Satler, Ian Malcolm, and the rest of the appealing and memorable characters of the earlier movies are replaced with broad movie archetypes and superfluous supporting characters. With respect to our new kid characters and Vincent D\'Onofrio\'s bone-headed military grunt, the only two characters worth noting in Jurassic World are Owen Grady, a rugged dino-expert played by bona fide movie star Chris Pratt, and Claire Dearing, an uptight scientist played by Bryce Dallas-Howard. Both are really likable in doses, and the script doesn\'t subject us to too much of their dopey bantering. While Owen and Claire are cliched, and ultimately uninteresting, as characters, the charm and sheer star power of Pratt and Dallas-Howard are quite enough to bolster JW\'s brand of disposable summer adventuring.There\'s a neat little hook to the story of Jurassic World. After a re-branding of sorts, John Hammond\'s dream is finally realized and Jurassic Park is opened and fully operating. However, when the public begins to lose interest in seeing the same old dinosaurs, the scientists of Jurassic World are prompted to create an all-new hybrid dinosaur called the Indominus Rex. Well, you guessed it, that dinosaur escapes. Okay, so that\'s a clever solution to the classic Jurassic Park sequel dilemma, ""How does this stuff keep happening?"", but that plot line takes all of twenty minutes to peter into a chase picture, and a simple one at that. The few subplots are banal. Be it, two brothers who come to Jurassic World to spend time with their aunt, or a ridiculous plan to weaponize velociraptors (The latter of those subplots is one of the most embarrassingly stupid ideas I\'ve seen in a movie in years), Jurassic World doesn\'t have much to get invested in besides big scary monsters running after people.There is one aspect of the film that I love, and that is the design of the Jurassic World Resort. The care that went into perfecting the look of the theme park is a great deal higher than the care that went into the story or the filmmaking. Jurassic World is a living, breathing place, and it is filled with all kinds of minor details that help sell the illusion. The triceratops petting zoo, the hamster ball ride, the souvenir shops, and scores of other theme park related details are touches that I was grateful made it into the film. There are more than a few nice moments where you get to enjoy the park as it was ""intended"". The immersion lasts throughout, even as the prehistoric psycho-killer, and all the destruction that it brings, takes center stage. Once the Indominus Rex gets out, and all Hell breaks loose, director Colin Trevorrow\'s filmmaking starts to show its deficiencies. Jurassic World is an impressive technical feat. The action is staged well, and the special effects and production designs are incredibly polished. It all looks like a million bucks (or 150 million to be exact), and it\'s all very fun, but when it comes to the meat of the movie, it\'s foolish to think that Jurassic World is anything more than Transformers with dinosaurs. In Jurassic Park and The Lost World, Steven Spielberg infused his action scenes with tension and suspense. There was a certain kind of visual poetry to the T-Rex attack in the first movie or the raptors in the grass scene from The Lost World. They were exhilarating because of their selective restraint. Without showing everything, Spielberg made scenes that were subtle and scary, and that exploded to life at just the right moments. Jurassic World\'s action scenes are big, loud, and entertaining, but it\'s all chaos, no technique. Trevorrow throws the kitchen sink into every shot. The Indominus Rex chomps up dozens of machine gun toting mercenaries, pterodactyls dart all over the screen pecking and biting everything in sight, and big, lumbering CGI beasts fight each other and destroy every last peanut brittle building around them. Sound familiar? It\'s the kind of Call of Duty-esque sensory bombardment that can be loads of fun to watch while you\'re there but doesn\'t leave the lasting impact of truly great action.So it is with Jurassic World. The movie is big, bright, and fun, with lots of action and good special effects. It pleases crowds. But as with most big budget crowd pleasers, it comes with dull characters, brain dead plotting and booming CGI overload. Jurassic World left me with the exact same feeling I got after seeing Jurassic Park 3. Both movies are serviceable summer romps, full of dino-action and great visual effects, but there is simply a noticeable dip in the quality of the production. Jurassic World successfully mines from the franchise name a good B-caliber FX spectacular. For dumb summer fun, it works. But there was a time when Jurassic Park aspired to more than dumb summer fun. Steven Spielberg\'s first two movies had class. They grappled with ideas, they were intelligent, they showcased real filmmaking, and they were genuinely thrilling. Jurassic World is colorful and entertaining, but let\'s be clear, when it\'s all said and done, nothing beats Spielberg. 74/100', 'The 4th film in the Jurassic Park series and the second sequel that Steven Spielberg did not direct starts off well enough with enough call backs to the first film of the series but quickly turns into a monster movie with a run away super killer dinosaur that was spliced by the DNA of other prehistoric creatures for the sake of selling extra tickets. If my description of the plot Is pretty simplistic,it\'s because the story is that simple. So forget the dangers of science morality tales that both ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" gave to it\'s stories and just accept that the series has become a standard creature feature that just swaps out it\'s main monster for every new installment. The last film in the series ""Jurassic Park 3"" pretty much threw away the whole plot lines of the first two films just to give us a chase film with a dinosaur that was never even seen in ""The Lost World"" and that film was set on the same island. While ""Jurassic Park 3"" just went on a painful 90 minutes long montage of talking raptors, horrible scenes of family bonding and an visible annoyed Sam Neill looking like he\'s about to go postal on the people working on the film set, Jurassic World manages to be a hell of a lot more enjoyable experience for the viewer in terms of just trying to inject a sense of plot and continuity to this other wise creature feature.As a standard creature feature, the movie works well and gives you your money\'s worth of dinosaurs doing collateral damage to property and personnel with the occasional park visitor being killed for good measure. Throw in your slack jaw good guy ( Chris Pratt) who feels that the creatures are misunderstood and works with good guy dinosaurs(I Kidd you not) to help stop the super killer dinosaur. Throw in an human adversary for our hero to fight with ( Vincent D""Onofrio) who would blow the whole island up to get this monster and add an human element like two lost children who are related to a employee at this crazy theme park who by the way has the hots for our hero and you have the entire story right there.It\'s hard enough to keep a franchise going, especially when you\'re dealing with dinosaurs walking the earth. You will eventually hit a wall in terms of storytelling if your primary goal is to keep turning these films out with out any care what so ever. We saw that with ""Jurassic Park 3"" where all the plot points from the previous two films were abandon for a B Movie creature feature. ""Jurassic World"" tries hard to correct that by having the movie be about something a little more and try to connect itself to the first film of the series. And Its much better film for it but it still ends up a creature feature all the same.', ""Let's start this by stating how much of a die hard fan I am of 'Jurassic Park', I love that film, always have, always will. 'The Lost World' is a worthy followup, but at the same time lost the panache the first one had, as for the third entry, I'll overlook it because it just got too silly for my liking... anyway, on to 'Jurassic World'. First of all, the positives outweigh the negatives by far, so to start I shall begin with the flaws. 'Jurassic World' near enough scraps the use of animatronics that made the original films so realistic in comparison and instead overuses CGI, but that aside the visual effects are stunning. And the story, well, it's a little too far-fetched to say the least, but not to the point where it's completely ridiculous, just enough for you to have a laugh but still enjoy it nonetheless. Trevorrow's direction, Pratt's acting and Giacchino's score are all superb, and these combined make the film a worthy watch. The film perfectly blends drama, emotion and action, and when I say action, I mean full-on awe- inspiring action. The closing battle is just rife with intensity, to the extent that I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat in the cinema, it was perfectly choreographed (if maybe a tad predictable) but my heart was racing, I hadn't felt that excited with a film's conclusion for a long time. All-in-all, it's a well- executed and beautifully-crafted sequel, but will never outdo the original, the best 'Jurassic Park', but a second spot grab? I think so."", 'Fine but predictable return to form for the Jurassic Park series finds John Hammond\'s dream for a ""Jurassic Park"" becoming a reality. However, in a way to have more people come back to the island, scientist\'s create a hybrid dinosaur as a new attraction. But, like every Jurassic Park film in the series, things don\'t go off as planed and all hell breaks loose in it\'s aftermath. Unlike the last 3 movies however, this film is made up of mostly new characters to hold off the Dinosaurs with the exception of a small side character from the Original Jurassic Park film played by BD Wong, who to be quite honest is only there to somehow fulfill continuity from The first film to the new one. It would have made more sense to bring in some of the original leads to bridge the whole series together but that seems to be asking too much. The new characters starting with lead Chris Pratt are fine but underwritten and cliché. Pratt\'s character and performance is really the only bright spot of the new cast of characters but he lacks the cool sarcastic wit and intelligence of Jeff Goldblum\'s Ian Malcolm and The everyman appeal of Sam Neill\'s Dr Alan Grant. Pratt however brings his own warm, comic sensibility that does make him endearing in his own right but unlike Goldblum and Neill who brought dramatic tension to the films, Pratt gets overshadowed by the dinosaurs once the bloody carnage begins. Bryce Dallas Howard is decent but unremarkable in the uptight corporate woman with no life role and Vincent D\'Onofrio is OK as the resident head of security of the park. Of course, there are two kids who plays the nephews of Howard\'s character who are put in the middle of the action one it begins, leading to a predictable climax that while is full of thrills, could have been seen a mile a away.The Dinosaur effects in this film are probably the best in the series so far and while there are moments of Obvious CGI, it really does not distract from how far effects have come over the years from the first film to this one. In terms of dino carnage, this film comes in a little behind The Lost World in that department but not by much. The body count is higher here than in any of the other films in the series but lacks the tension and showmanship that Jurassic Park and The Lost World had in spades. It\'s however head shoulders above what Jurassic Park 3 had in those departments. Not to mention the fact that while the script for Jurassic World is fairly predictable, it does not overstay it\'s welcome. Unlike the underwritten Jurassic Park 3 with its very unlikeable characters.Jurassic World is a fine addition to the Jurassic Park series. While its pretty predicable and not as good or as tension filled as the first two films of the series, it\'s a vast improvement over the disappointing 3rd film. However, if there should be a fifth film, they need to go beyond the new monster of the week and come up with a better script to justify this series continuing for another film.', ""First of all I think people need to understand that film is a lot like music, you can't listen to a new Justin Bieber song and complain because it's not a Mozart masterpiece. And you definitely can't watch Jurassic World expecting a mind-boggling, emotional Inception type film. I would put Jurassic World in the same category as most Michael Bay films, the story line won't make you think, the characters won't go through any psychological changes but you will be thoroughly entertained by the special effects. I think it's fairly obvious throughout the original trilogy and this film that we are the visitors to the attractions, Steven Spielberg gave the parallel Earth a new unimaginable attraction, one which surprised the audience so much, it's rated as one of the best films ever. Period. Fast forward twenty two years past the films of Interstellar, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, we as a human race have seen a lot of original, unique things, a plain old dinosaur film will not bring us the same thrills as it did in 1993. Therefore we are once again, the visitors to the attraction. We will never feel the same buzz as first seeing that T-Rex crashing the gates over, or the same chill down the neck when first hearing that Raptor shriek. However, we can still be entertained. Which is what happens throughout the film. The characters are fairly bland, there are only a couple likable ones, but they all seem to grow on you near the end, the bloodbath that is left by the new Dino is quite emotional and gives you a side to pick fairly easily, the surprises throughout the film keep it exciting and the special effects, well we are in 2015 and they did have a lot of money to spend so lets just say they are incredible as expected. If you're looking to be on the edge of your seat for two hours and trust the film to not bore you, then you have nothing to worry about, the line graph representing excitement just climbs up and up, if you're expecting another Shawshank Redemption, well please don't slate the film when it doesn't satisfy your needs. I think that films should have two ratings, one for overall, and another for it's main sub-category, for example as an overall film I'd give it a 7.5-8, it's sub-category of excitement I'd give a solid 10, a comparison to the first Transformers which I'd give an 8 for excitement and a 5 overall. Therefore I really do recommend this film for anyone who like me, enjoys special effects, good excitement and two hours to just sit on the edge of my seat and thoroughly enjoy my time. I can only say I can't wait for the second one and I'm sure you will too after you watch it."", ""So, I liked this movie, but boy is it full of clichés and stereotypes. My partner and I found ourselves calling out every character, what they would end up doing within moments of being introduced to them.Seriously, there is an entire butcher's-worth of ham-fistedness in the approach to character intro's and scene building here. You'll know what will happen long in advance of it actually happening on screen.What this does is make the movie utterly predictable and, in essence, boring. At your first viewing, you will feel like you have seen it before.It also says something about a film featuring dinosaurs that it is at its best when they aren't on screen. I don't know how this came about, but, for the most part, the dino's are a little dull and uninteresting. They plod, they run, they roar, and all in glorious CGI. Yet they fail to evoke the same emotions that they did in JP1 or even 2.That's not to say the human actors are a lot better, but at least they have some thin characterisation applied to them, even if it is in the form of horrible stereotyping.I mean, military guy who is bent on weaponizing the dinos, distant aunt who has no skill with children (bet you can't guess where her story-arc evolves to?) What? Oh yeah, that's right... she does discover her nurturing instincts. Wow! You're better at this than the writers!Don't get me wrong. It is a solid popcorn flick. But the lazy writing does it tremendous harm. I swear they have some sort of software in Hollywood that churns this stuff out. There are no surprises here. None.Acting and Effects are capable. No one really stinks and there aren't that many obvious CGI moments (in so much as we know it is all CGI anyway, nothing shows itself about the perceptual parapet, as it were).It is a decent watch, but expecting the expected is no longer fun when taken to this extreme.SUMMARY: Formulaic and totally predictable. Nothing to write home about. See it, and then move on."", 'Jurassic world is the #1 movie in America. This movie deserves the right to be called back especially with all the money it earned especially in the first week it was out. It\'s been 14 years since the last time I saw Jurassic Park. I never would have thought that they would be making a Fourth one and when I heard they were making a new one I was ecstatic. It brought back all the memories of the first 3 films. When the day came for Jurassic World to open it had to go see it on opening day and I did. The movie gave us the same feeling Jurassic Park 1 did ""Welcome to Jurassic World"". The new park looked amazing showing that John Hammond\'so dream finally came true. The music was more amazing than ever, the original Jurassic Park theme was re-prised to show how much thing had changed in 14 years. The main attraction of this movie was the Indominus Rex and hybrid of T-Rex, Raptor, cuddle fish, and Tree frog and terrifying intelligence. At the end of the movie we get to see the original T-Rex from the first movie roar for the last time after the park was closed for good. This movie brought back so many memories for so many people. I can\'t wait for the next one.', ""I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park franchise, it's my favorite franchise, my life revolves around it and dinosaurs. I was very nervous for Jurassic World, because it had been so so long since we've seen them back on Isla Nublar (22 years to be exact). This made me go into the film as a mainstream film fan, so I could really tell if this was a good film or not, without being bias. I was amazed by how much this film makes you feel like a kid again, it has the exact amount of nostalgia to please the fans of the franchise and enough new material to appeal to a younger audience who maybe haven't seen the first three films.First of all, the cast which this film possess is used to great effect, with the most notable being Chris Pratt, his character Owen Grady is the perfect blend of Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm, making him likable and very quirky in how he behaves around his Velociraptors and people in general. Bryce Dallas Howard's character breaks the conventions of a female character in a film of this genre, she takes control of situations and you feel that she isn't a girl to run away from danger...apart from running away from the Indominous Rex, which I don't blame anyone for doing so. The supporting characters in the film also help it to come alive and make you think this is a real park with real lives at risk, especially Vincent D'Onfario in his role, he plays it magnificently and you can feel his tension yourself and finally Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins as the kids in peril aren't as annoying as Kelly in the lost world, so that's an improvement to take note for.When the first trailer for Jurassic World was released, way back at the end of November 2014, people were starting to get very worried about the effects in this film and how they will improve from the first film, the same with the use of animatronics in this film. Well my friends and fellow fans, the CGI in this film are brilliant to look at, even though some scenes you can tell it is from a computer scene, the rest you couldn't tell the difference, they used the animatronics in scenes where they were necessary which has a lot of sentimental value for the film which was a nice touch. Most people thought in this film the Tyrannosaurus would play a minor role like it did in Jurassic Park 3, but the way they utilize the old girl is brilliant, she is amazing to look at and she even has the scars form the fight with the raptors from the first film, you cannot make the T-Rex have a small role in this film, especially when she's the poster girl for this magnificent franchise. It will be hard to make Jurassic World 2 better than this one, but here is to hoping!"", '**spoilers ahead.** I am a great fan of Jurassic Park. I loved it when I watched it in 90s but it was a new concept back then. It had a great story and some of the best visuals at that time. It was not completely predictable and it was fun.Fast forward 22 years and we have ""Jurassic world"". The story picks up after 22 years of Jurassic Park. I am not going into the details of the plot, but it is almost similar to the original Jurassic Park. We have a park where people can come and see the genetically modified dinosaurs. One of them escapes and goes berserk. Now Chris Pratt has to stop him from causing more destruction. So there is nothing new in terms of story.It is similar to some of the other movies that we have already seen.The CGI looks really good but these days even a low budget film has some really nice graphics work. But if you are a fan of 3D, you will have some fun as it has got some really scary scenes and the effects are amazing.It is predictable yet enjoyable. Chris Prett does a great job. In fact, he is the only person in the movie who is likable. I did not care about other characters.Now let\'s talk about the negatives. There are so many things that are wrong with this film. But I have made a list of the things that don\'t make sense. I am not going to talk about the technical things because everything is good except for the BGM. 1- Who enters a dinosaur\'s territory without knowing where the Dinosaur is? they could have tracked him before entering the cage, just to be sure. and Did I mention that we are talking about a genetically modified dinosaur with the IQ of Einstein?2- The character played by Judy Greer and Bryce are so annoying. Judy starts crying for a stupid reason ( because her sister didn\'t accompany the children, she works in Jurassic World, she has a lot of work to do.)3 - Bryce does not know what logic means. There are moments where she shows her STUPIDITY. (Like - ""screaming"" even though she knows that the dinosaur could hear her voice.)4 - The kids are the most stupid ones I have ever seen. I mean you are in Jurassic World. If there is an emergency then it must be something important. Get the hell out of there. But no, we have to see everything.5- Who the hell designed this stupid spherical vehicle that the kids used? Dinosaurs could have easily destroyed it, One swing of their tail and it would China. who wants to travel in such a vehicle?6- Chris Pratt and Bryce go out to find the children and their defense is - A GUN. What? Are you going to kill that Dinosaur with a GUN?7- Chris and Bryce see some dead or soon-to-be- dead dinosaurs so they make sure that they waste a lot of time with them albeit they have to save the children and time is running fast.8- Chris goes out to kill the dinosaur with a team, but only one of them has a Bazooka. Then they wait for the Dinosaur to have some giggles with the small dinosaurs. They could have brought 5-6 Bazookas with them and launch them at the same time. We saw what 1 Bazooka did to him. 5-6 could have easily killed him or at least crippled him.9- What the hell is the deal with those 4 dinosaurs who keep changing sides?10- I honestly could not understand what Chris Pratt\'s role was? He did not do anything in the whole movie except for running. He was useful at only one place - The climax. He somehow hypnotizes the small dinosaurs, but even that doesn\'t do anything.11- The Dues ex machina Ending. (A big Dinosaur saves the day). Maybe I am nitpicking but these are the examples of sloppy writing. You must avoid such things. Some scenes reminded me of Avatar and the climax reminded me of Godzilla.Overall it is a nice movie to pass your time but it is not a must watch. It does not get anywhere near to the level of Spielberg\'s original Jurassic Park. but yeah, It is a great improvement over Jurassic Park 3 which was a complete mess.', ""Dinosaurs. Amusement Park. Tourists. Disaster.Jurassic World has them all.Naturally, I had to see it.The beginning holds much promise, and it gets your hopes up for the disaster to come. When it does, there are some great action sequences, especially ones with the glass ball containing the soft, chewy child centre.Unfortunately the final act unravels into outright farce.Chris Pratt is great as the affable yet bad-ass Raptor Whisperer. He's got an easy going charisma that could easily carry an iconic character like Indiana Jones.Bryce Dallas Howard plays Claire Dearing, the uptight park manager, who initially clashes with the laid back Owen. Of course you know where the tension goes.The film tries to flesh out Claire's character by throwing in her two nephews (someone and another kid), who do double duty as McGuffins.Vincent D'Onofrio shows up as Hoskins, a villainous representative of the military-industrial complex angling to weaponize velociraptors. He's all sneers and scenery chewing, so obviously evil he's got a goatee. D'Onofrio does it well but the evil plan he's been saddled with by the writers makes no sense at all.The director, Colin Trevorrow, said in interviews that he wanted the dinosaurs to act like real animals, not cartoon monsters. Quelle surprise! I had no idea, as he has well-fed winged dinos (or near enough to dinos) go on a crazed orgy of violence against hapless tourists. Why? Because cool action sequence!One poor soul is even treated to the most outlandishly elongated death sequence I've ever seen, all to no end. It didn't justify anything, paid nothing back, offered no comeuppance. It was just gleeful indulgence in sadistic torture of a minor character. It was an Itchy & Scratchy moment.Which brings us to the final act: turn off your brain before it begins.The first movie proved you could have a smart script and dinosaurs in the same movie. After that, the IQ of the series dropped with each outing. The first one had chaos theory and amber and DNA extraction and cleverness up the whazoo. It was AWESOME.What does this one have? Hackneyed evil plans, a clunky plot, and characters so smart they run from T-Rex's in high heels.The franchise has had a lobotomy."", ""As a huge fan of the original JURASSIC PARK - I was twelve years old when I saw it in 1993, pretty much the perfect age - I was eager to check out this all-new and revamped sequel/update/reboot of the premise. At the same time, I pretty much dismissed memories of the previous two sequels, which were entirely forgettable and sub-par popcorn flicks. The new JURASSIC WORLD is one heck of a mixed bag as a film. It contains many, many flaws and parts I hated, alongside some good moments that I enjoyed. It's very similar to the new TERMINATOR GENISYS in that respect, although an improvement over the Schwarzenegger movie. The good parts of JURASSIC WORLD are invariably those which involve the dinosaurs";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He is a fine actor and it is in full display here as Christian Wolff, one of his aliases. We see from flashbacks to his childhood that his autism hindered his development but with a combination of a military father who taught him to fight his own battles and a clinic that treats those with a variety of disorders, he grew up to become a ""high functioning"" adult. And with his unusual talents with numbers became a highly effective Accountant.His dark secret is that he often works for world-wide crime organizations and gets compensated very well. Although he has a house, very sparsely furnished, his real possession is a trailer he keeps inside a storage unit, it has most of his wealth, rare artworks, and his guns.Christian takes no guff from anyone and when he goes after a person or a group is a very effective killer. Anna Kendrick as company Accountant Dana Cummings and J. K. Simmons as Tax agent Ray King, both get pulled into his world.The topic is distasteful, a criminal Accountant who goes after bad people, judge, jury and executioner. But it is a very well made movie and the acting is top-notch.DEC 2022 edit: Just watched it again after 5 1/2 years, most of it was fresh enough, my earlier comments are still valid.', 'Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is an efficient accountant that is usually hired to find financial deceptions and embezzlement for criminal organizations. His point of contact is a woman\'s voice by phone and the means of payment are sometimes valuable paintings or gold bars instead of money. Christian was an autistic child that received a rigid military training with his brother Braxton from their paranoid military father. The director of the Treasure Department Raymond ""Ray"" King (J.K. Simmons) has been unsuccessfully hunting The Accountant for a long period and he blackmails the efficient analyst Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) to identify who he is before his retirement. When the accountant Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick) finds an embezzlement of 61 million-dollars in the Living Robotics, Christian is hired to audit the company by the owner Lamar Blackburn (John Lithgow) and his sister Rita Blackburn (Jean Smart). The financial director Ed Chilton (Andy Umberger) tells that Dana committed a mistake but soon Christian checks the books and confirms the embezzlement. During the night, Chilton is murdered as if he had committed suicide and Lamar finishes the audit affecting Christian that have not finished his work. Soon Dana and he are hunted down by hit men and Christian protects her. Meanwhile Median finds his true identity and Christian is hunted by Ray and the FBI. Who might be the person behind the embezzlement? ""The Accountant"" is an original and above average action film. The cast has great performances";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"['EDITED: Why do people keep reporting me for spoilers?! There isn\'t a single spoiler in this review. That Jean Grey is back? The trailer showed that! Idiots.The war between mutants and humans rages on \x96 as well as between mutants and other mutants \x96 and the spark that lights the fuse in this X-Men installment is the government-funded ""Mutant-cure"" project that is taking place on Alcatraz. Magneto and his fanatic followers are appalled by this idea (""They want to cure us? I say we ARE the cure \x96 for homo sapiens."") and go into military mode to fight the humans. Because we all know the best defense is a good offense. This conflict pins Xavier and his academy somewhere in between, raising questions such as how far should we go for social conformity? Is mutation a disease, or is it part of who we are? I think that X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) has got it all right when it comes to ethics and message because it is not in-your-face or preachy at any point. It is an objective study how this cure changes people and mutants alike (not just the ones it is injected to). Magneto cannot stand the prospect of losing his mutant identity to a human cure while Rogue wants it and Jean needs it. Director Brett Ratner neutrally navigates the themes of social conformity and ethical values with effortless skill in the film which I find impressive since it is a heavy topic and he only recently jumped onboard the X-Men fare. So ""well done"" here is an understatement. He does a great job.The problem is that at some point greedy hack producers deemed this well-sketched template of mutants vs. humans going to war over ethics ""insufficient"" for a long action-feature. More was needed, they thought, and slapped on extra-template love-stories, reborn-stories and offputting attempts at establishing moods that reeks of cheesy character development Kodak-moment. The latter manifests itself at several points in the film, mainly in scenes with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) coming to terms with his love for Jean. He does this by brooding and exchanging meaningful glances.Jean\'s woeful reborn storyline is X-Men\'s fatal flaw. Sloppy writing. When reaching the point when Jean\'s miraculous survival from the impact of the water needs to be explained by some brainy scientist (in this case Xavier), he simply offers the explanation: ""Her powers wrapped her in a cocoon of telekinetic energy."" OK, so no we now. Idiotic. Poor Famke Janssen gets to inhabit a truly badly-written character as The Last Stand plays on, and she plays it badly too. She has come back super-powerful and super-sexy (logically??). Most of the film she is not really doing anything, but stands aside looking imposing while the other characters remark how superhuman she is and how powerful she has become: ""She\'s so strong."" - Xavier (yes, he actually says that -- it\'s a joke). When she finally does get to shine, she does not really shine at all but her scene becomes completely over-the-top and desensitizes you to the action. Luckily, X-Men: The Last Stand is not Jean Grey\'s show. Curiously enough it is not Wolverine\'s show either. Instead the central characters take a backseat to the wide montage of new, eccentric, colourful mutant character from both Magneto and Xavier\'s camp \x96 such as Juggernaught (""...bitch""), Arclight (hands down the coolest mutant power) and Callisto. Whenever there is a showdown between the two camps it is absolute gold. Even early in the film in Jean\'s house when they meet and fight briefly for the first time, you know you\'re in for a cinematic ride of vivid special visual- and audio effects as the characters blow ice, shoot metal, stir up storms and walk through walls. They mess up the house so much that it looks as though its walls are made out of paper that they just tear down and walk through. It\'s brilliantly handled with creative new scenarios.However the single most poignant scene is only a few minutes into the film \x96 in a flashback of sorts that zooms in on a little mutant boy who has locked himself in the bathroom, cutting off his wings. He cries and there is blood and white feathers everywhere and it is just a staggering image. This little boy is Angel. This scene convinced me I was in for one hell of a ride \x96 and I was because there is a lot of the cinematic ""big, bigger, epic"" formula but ultimately it is a terribly uneven film with poor dialogue (lines you can guess before the character says it), mediocre acting and plain silly extra-template story lines.6 out of 10', 'Wow, where do I start on this fiasco of a movie. In regards to my affection for the first two movies in the series, please see my rating for them. I gave them both high marks, and had anticipated the third movie with much joy and glee. My glee turned to flee not long into this horrible flick. The only thing that remotely saves it from being a total disaster is the graphics, and the hope that you will see it develop into a good movie. If you wasted 8 buck o roonies like myself to see this in theater, well don\'t feel bad, because some poor jokers sat out all night to see it on opening night. This one is even debatable on rental. Let it go to the special section, or as I call it ""The Last Stand.""', 'This contains spoilers, but nevermind since the movie is bad and you shouldn\'t go see it.There were two good things about X-Men III. First, we arrived a bit late so I actually missed all the advertisements. Second, at one point in the movie they show a family trapped in a car in front of Magneto and his army of mutants, and the woman actually locks the car thinking it\'s going to make a difference. That would have made me smile if I hadn\'t been busy listing the best ways to kill the movie director at that point.I don\'t even know where to start, so I\'ll begin with how Brett Ratner deals with the characters. Cyclops is killed. Professor Xavier is killed. Jean Grey is killed. Mystique is now a human. Rogue is now a human. Magneto is now a human (although a little doubt remains, see ""the worst ending sequence in the history of mankind"" paragraph). Now you may be wondering ""who the hell remains except for Wolverine and Storm"" (you may also be wondering why Ratner is still living)? Well, Director Stupid introduced a new group of totally uninteresting mutants, with absolutely no personality. Juggernaut and Multiple Man agree to join Magneto not knowing who he is or wtf he is planning to do. Kitty Pride looks like she\'s twelve, Angel is apparently only in the movie for advertisement purposes (he has almost as much screen time as in the trailer), Callisto is the needed \'ghetto\' black character (seriously, listen to how she speaks... or don\'t, actually don\'t), there was even some emo/Gothic girl, I\'m still trying to figure why Magneto didn\'t slap her for getting that haircut. Beast first appears as a scholar then fights with the other X-Men at the end, not much to say about him. Wait, there\'s not much to say about any of those characters except ""die in a fire"".That brings us to the actual plot and storyline. When a sad Cyclops tells Wolverine ""Not everyone heals as fast as you do"", I knew this movie was going to suck. I can easily imagine the writers patting each other in the back for three hours after finding that line. Way to go, too bad everyone in the audience almost puked when he said that. Anyway, Cyclops dies like a punk less than twenty minutes into the movie, and guess what we don\'t even see his death. Apparently they felt they were going the right way since the script just keeps getting worse. I guess they tried to bring in as many things from the comics as possible and mix them, but instead of actually developing each element they rushed the movie (it\'s one hour forty minutes long), which ruined everything. Rogue taking the cure is not exploited enough, Jean turning into the Phoenix is a big joke, she just stands there doing nothing after Magneto recruits her. She eventually decides to annihilate the universe at the end, which is a pathetic excuse for a thirty-seconds FX sequence. When she asks Wolverine ""Are you willing to die for them?"", he answers ""I\'m willing to die for you"". Any writer that comes up with such a line should be shot dead. No trial, just shot. Don\'t even get me started on Xavier\'s death or the fact that there are no flames around the Phoenix (Jane), they couldn\'t even get the stupid flames right. What the hell does she do anyway? Make confettis? Can her power look any less impressive? ""Oh no, she\'s making confettis, nevermind that Magneto just made the Golden Gate Bridge levitate and let\'s RUN FOR OUR LIVES!!"". The only good thing about her is that she killed the emo/Gothic guy.Pyro is a stupid arrogant kid, who keeps acting tough because he can throw flames. Wow, you were born with your power and you can actually use it, that\'s like bragging about knowing how to walk. Get a job elsewhere than in a circus and I might be impressed. He can\'t even use his power properly, I mean he ignites cars thrown by Magneto. Maybe next time you could actually think of, I don\'t know, throwing fire AT YOUR ENEMIES and not at stupid flying cars? Everything is so rushed that you stop caring anyway.The worst ending sequence in the history of mankind: The ending sequence features Magneto sitting at a chess table in a park. Now Magneto only started a mutant vs human war, ruined the Golden Gate Bridge, launched an attack on the Alcatraz Island that resulted in the complete destruction of the place and the death of dozens of soldiers, you\'d think he\'d maybe get a little prison time. But no, apparently everyone is happy in stupid land, they all kissed and hugged and he\'s forgiven. But that\'s not the worst thing, we also actually see Magneto move a chess piece without touching it, meaning that his power is not completely gone, meaning that EVERYTHING IS MAYBE NOT OVER! Arggghhhh, stop it already! It was announced that this would be the last X-Men movie (and believe me, it\'s for the greater good), end it like a man and don\'t imply something else might happen. Magneto is free and his power is not completely gone. WTF has changed since the beginning of the movie except that the X-Men have lost so many members that they have to fight with twelve-year-olds and Magneto doesn\'t have stupid Pyro following him anymore? The credits come up directly after we see the piece moving, with a sound supposed to make you go ""wow!"". Well I did go ""wow!"", and by ""wow!"" I mean ""let\'s hunt Ratner down and send him to the one place where he belongs"", which is the nearest black hole. X-Men 3 is terrible, don\'t go see it.', ""I saw this movie yesterday, and although I thought it was a good movie, I am sad to say that it is without doubt the worse of the trilogy.The problem with X-Men: The Last Stand is not that it's bad, because it's not.

Gary Busey had the distinct pleasure of appearing not only in this surfer flick, but 1978\'s ""Big Wednesday"" as well, though he limits his venture in this one to strictly land based activities. My ears perked up when I heard Johnny mention his surveillance of Bodhi by stating that he saw him go into Patrick\'s Roadhouse, a neat reference to Swayze\'s 1978 picture of the same name. I thought it noble for Johnny to let Bodhi go out on his own terms at the finale during the much anticipated \'fifty year storm\', an ending that would appeal to the most hard core action fans, even if you had to picture it in your own imagination.', ""Who misses Patrick Swayze - I know I do.

I rarely get to go to a movie with my older son after his siblings came along. We did manage to go to this movie in the cinemas. Not only were we glad we chose this movie to watch, but two years later, we still recall the impact this movie had on both of us. This science fiction story is deeply satisfying. The movie treats the viewers as intelligent people. It is not in the same league of a plethora of science fiction movies that hit the cinemas every year. For example this year we have Independence Day 2, a high budget sequel to a high budget b-movie from a long time ago. It is profoundly forgettable. That is in stark contrast to Edge of Tomorrow, which has stayed with me for so long and today motivated me to come here on IMDb to write a review after two years!This movie is a must watch. Thanks for reading.', 'Why do we go to the movies? To be entertained, to laugh, to be amused, to be pulled into situations that are far from ever happening to us. The only certainty in today\'s film world that the film that you pick to watch in cinema is Tom Cruise. If you go into cinema and see any of Cruise\'s films you can be damn sure that that film won\'t disappoint you. Tom Cruise sure picks great projects. Frankly, I have to say that I haven\'t seen a bad film starring Tom Cruise.Edge of Tomorrow is described by the director himself as ""Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers"". The former mentioned is actually quite important since the trailers made this film look pretty dark, which is not the case. This is fun action film with lots of humor. Humor that perfectly fits this film. The time-loop allows the Cruise\'s Colonel Cage to remember exactly the situation he repeats over and over, which is many times very funny. At films with time-loop I am alway worried that the film might get repetitive. Well you don\'t have to when Doug Liman is at helm. The film has no time to get repetitive when it is moving at such fast pace. An action scene follows an actions and the scope is just mind blowing. This film packs in so much in just two hours. Other films usually keep the best scenes for the big finale. In Edge of Tomorrow all the action scenes are the best scenes of the film.Tom Cruise doesn\'t act as his usual self here, he plays against type. He always tries to come up with something new in his films. So in what role you haven\'t seen him yet? A wimpy coward. He once again shows what a versatile actor he is. Emily Blunt, as the kick ass Rita, has never been more likable in any of her films than here. she handles the action and the drama perfectly. Bill Paxton mostly just repeats his commands and lines about victory, but he is just so great at that he ends up as one of the funniest characters in the film To me this comes as no surprise, that Edge of Tomorrow is yet another sci-fi Tom Cruise film, which kick ass from start to finish. What roller-coaster ride! This will be hard to top in the upcoming summer season. There is nothing wrong with this film. It\'s got everything. Even a helicopter crash!', ""It's hard to compromise how a film of such similar plot development to Groundhog Day can be considered to be such a great action movie, but like the events in this film, you just have to see it to believe it. Edge of Tomorrow is honestly my favorite Tom Cruise movie, and when you have such a great track record like Cruise, that's really saying something. The film is phenomenal, as with Groundhog Day it follows a similar plot, but it certainly has a different way at going at the themes it develops. Cruise and Blunt make a terrific pair in this action/sci-fi/thriller and the film is nothing short of brilliant. The special effects are mesmerizing, the look of the film daunting, and yet nostalgic and fully realized. I love the development of the world we find our characters in, and all the aliens it involves. I love nearly every aspect of this film, and although on the surface it may not seem original, it certainly feels that way. In the end, Edge of Tomorrow is a must see action flick that will have audiences on the edge of their seats, and is a must see for any Sci-=fi or Cruise fan in general.\nMy Rating: 10/10"", ""One of the most ingenious film concepts ever created, a cross between 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Groundhog Day', 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a gripping and clever blockbuster sci-fi thrill-ride accompanied with taut, fast-paced action and compelling direction. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt form a perfect chemistry that takes them from the training ground, to the battlefield through to the action-bound finale in Paris. The premise of the time-loop has been used many times before, but this time round there are enough exciting visuals and dynamic storytelling skills employed to make this one thrilling (and unexpectedly comedic) flick that is unpredictable and expertly designed. A model of cinematic craftsmanship."", ""The parrallels with Groundhog Day are obvious to anyone who has seen that movie. As an avid video game enjoyer I couldn't see the film as anything else but leveling up a character, acquiring new skills and knowledge, exploring the posibilities of the enviroment. If you happen to misstep, you are back to square one, trying something else in hope to finish the quest.Even Emily Blunt looks like she came from a video game, she fights the mimics with a sword?? That image of her on the passing bus looking badass, may as well be one of the characters in Tekken.The movie is all about the two protagonists and their chemistry is undeniable. The mutual foundness they develop is touching. It's a science fiction film that certainly felt novel and distinctive."", ""What if humanity faced an enemy that could control/manipulate time? What would the best response be? This is the main premise of this film. At first, the whole idea of an alien invasion sounded unappealing as it a used and abused theme. In this case however it has been intelligently reworked.Initially, it appeared as just another Tom Cruise movie since the first 10 minutes were about his refusal to join a combat unit by being his usual charming self. Following this and having been forced into battle, he soon dies but that rather than being the end it was just the beginning.As soon as he died, his final day restarted. Again and again. He encounters the same people and has the same conversations all over again. The initial shock and disbelief were followed by learning to use this to his advantage in order to help win the war. My favourite bit of this film is the smart way in which the main character's final day was rebooted without ever becoming tiresome.So whilst it has all the elements of a blockbuster, it also shows that when you elegantly present the story it can really add to the experience."", 'One of the best time travel and action movies. I can watch over and over again. Each time you watch you see something you missed in earlier viewings. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt have great chemistry. I love them both in this.', 'An alien race has invaded the Earth starting in Europe. After 5 years of relentless defeats where the Mimics seem to anticipate every move, the United Defense Force finally has a victory with the invention of a new jacket technology.

General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) is sending him on the first wave to cover the expected victory. He is arrested and forced to fight under Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton). He manages to kill a large Mimic. He is sprayed with its blood and dies. He wakes up the previous morning as a prisoner about to go into battle.The action is fantastic. The idea is terrific. Tom Cruise starts as his arrogant stock character and transition into his superhero stock character. Emily Blunt continues to excel in a character reminiscent of her character in Looper. Everything comes together. This is funny and exciting. Doug Liman puts it all together into a great thrilling ride.', 'With thrilling action sequences, clever sense of humor and surprisingly intellectual storyline, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" shows a real deal of summer blockbuster movie and proves itself beyond expectation especially after unconvincing trailers. Perhaps the theme and alien character looks familiar with some popular sci-fi movies but it\'s still combined perfectly as an entertainment. Doug Liman as director smartly exploited \'re-setting the day\' aspect without making it complicated and escaping it from being dull with some quality combat moments also inserting lovable drama that is commanded by memorable chemistry from Tom Cruise and Emilly Blunt have carried whole scenes in it. Overall ""Edge of Tomorrow"" feels more satisfying than it might have been in any ways and shows how the non-sequel-reboot blockbuster movie should be done. It\'s definitely much fun than I have ever imagined and pleasurable to re-watch it over and over again.', 'Edge of Tomorrow (EOT for me) will be the most surprising blockbuster of this year (maybe along with X-Men: Days of Future Past) for doing its job so well that beats every expectation about what it has to offer. A storyline about one man that is shown to us doing the ""same"" things every time could be dull. But EOT has a thoughtful script full of turns and fun that entertains and allows to Cruise to do new things inside that particular Groundhog Day.I wont spoil anything because the movie is full of valuable twists, surprisingly good chemistry between Cruise and Emily Blunt (Full Metal B**ch) and it has an involving script aside of the spectacular action sequences. The first one in the movie is totally amazing. But the rest is as that good. The movie clearly develops in the action and the riveting pace. It offers what a great blockbuster should be and it reaches that superb goal.Also Tom Cruise gives his best performance in so many time. Maybe, I\'m not joking, this is his best performance ever. For the first time he is not doing an smiling hero. He is a coward. He is a scared and inexperienced soldier who has to learn to be more skillful (and to escape from his personal loop) every time he returns to the ""same"" day. And Cruise is wonderful in that role. You really don\'t recognize him. Forget his frequent smiling, his heroic or possible macho topics. This could be a new and groundbreaking role inside his career even if you are not a big fan of him (I\'m not going as far as saying that this is his best movie or the most enjoyable one of all, but this movie could be one of his best ones too). And when a movie has a star doing his job properly and much better than expected, a great script and a riveting pace (the movie is never boring) the whole concept has the job done. And that\'s the case of EOT. Also the stellar performances from Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson are truly good.In fact I\'m glad that this one came after ""Oblivion"". That one was good, but this one is different and much better. Don\'t expect ""Oblivion 2"" or its same style because you will be wrong.Please, trust me and go to the theater to enjoy this wonderful, original and surprising entertainment. It delivers much more than you could expect, delivers the best Cruise (in so many time that I personally think that this is Cruise at his best) and delivers a clever story with a good twist. Enjoy!', ""This is that rare thing, a blockbuster that does more than just deafen with noise of its machinery. More on this in a bit. But I'm also amazed at how well it deploys that machinery, I want to quickly note this deployment that shows we are at the hands of excellent practitioners.It's set in the near future, about warring alien invaders, but the template is from the past";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Some good action, comedy, and general excitement. there are also some cheesy moments but nothing too severe. i miss nicholas cage in his prime. (about 3 viewings)', ""National Treasure was not on my must-watch list. but it turned out to be a most pleasant surprise. the history behind the show may not be accurate and it also has around it, an air of mystery, but it certainly was a fun filled ride with the face-paced action flicks! I'm NOT a particular Cage fan. nonetheless i had to admit he did a pretty good job as Ben Gates - slightly serious yet very witty! together with Riley, they provided the tickles that brought the audience through the entire film.with no explicit language and scenes, National Treasure is well-suited for family entertainment! its a light-hearted film good for an evening of chilling out! the subtle love story also adds credit to the film.well done!"", '**********SPOILER WARNING************I had the pleasure of seeing this film twice at the theater. The only shows where I\'ve seen the audience more into a movie were Spider-man 1 & 2, X-MEN 2, and Rocky. The movie is interesting from start to finish. While all the actors (and actress) do a good job, Sean Bean steals the show. So many times, the villain can make or break the film. Sean Bean was the absolute best choice for this particular villain. The characters arrogance, intelligence, and relentless resolve shine through. I feel the main drawback to the film was its PG rating. It would have been better as a PG-13. Some obvious violence was toned down. Even people that never use foul language, would have dropped the ""F"" bomb here and there. But as it stands with its PG rating, everyone can enjoy it.', ""Director Jon Turtelaub and the usually entertaining Nicolas Cage make a good combination and a darn good movie. Cage plays Ben Gates, an archaeologist-historian on a present-day quest for an ancient treasure of the Knights Templar. This treasure has been kept secret for what seems forever by a long line of Freemasons dating back to the Declaration of Independence. According to generations of folklore, there is a clue on the back of the Declaration that will sustain the procession of clues leading to the treasure. Thus the Icon of all historical documents, the Declaration of Independence , must be borrowed/stolen. Now Gates must out race his former employer Ian Howe(Sean Bean)to the mythical treasure. Gates has the aid of one of his believers Riley Poole(Justin Bartha)and new convert Dr. Abigail Chase(Diane Kruger), who happens to be an employee of the Smithsonian Museum.This contrived tale is infectious as Cage's determination to be a hero among mortal men. This caper is held together with shards of comedy and a healthy helping of adventure. Bean seems flawless as the crafty villain. Rounding out the cast are: Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, Mark Pellegrino and Christopher Plummer. This poor man's Indiana Jones romp proves harmless fun for all ages."", 'I enjoy my action/adventure movies so finally checked this one out and it was a lot of fun This is basically mission impossible meets Indiana Jones how cool is that?!', '""National Treasure"" seemed the most innocuous of the offerings at the discount house, and one of the kids had been agitating to see it for a month or so. I gave in.I\'m glad I did.""National Treasure"" is a welcome throwback of a film. The hero\'s a little scuffed around the edges, but clearly one of the good guys. The reluctant (at first) heroine is spunky, smart and beautiful. The baddie is wealthy, charming and accented. And the sidekick\'s a scream.Nicolas Cage does well in that he doesn\'t try to play Benjamin Gates like Harrison Ford playing Indiana Jones. There\'s a bit of the geek buried none too deep in Cage\'s performance, and the only time he gets rough with a bad guy, he hurts his hand.Justin Bartha\'s overgrown-kid persona provides plenty of comic relief -- and it\'s a relief in itself that ""National Treasure"" doesn\'t fall back on the ""kill the sidekick"" formula. The film needs him, and it needs him all the way through.Diane Kruger and Sean Bean do a fine job of portraying two sides of the same coin: Immigrants obsessively chasing the American Dream. The difference is in their interpretation of the dream.There\'s one on screen death, not gory. There\'s little, if any, profanity. Brainpower, not firepower, carries the day. And there\'s a genuine regard for learning throughout the film (although, admittedly, a few of the facts are off).And yes, there are moments when you realize that being an old-school film hero means leading a particularly charmed life. After all, given the seasonal changes in the sun\'s daily position, what are the odds of it making a shadow fall just so -- just when the good guys need it to? But that\'s the way it is in a good hidden-treasure epic: When truth and right are on your side, someone makes sure you get the breaks.There\'s a moral buried in the ending, too, that can be taken either way. Sharing is good -- but is it sharing of physical wealth, or of a political ideal? Given the obvious reverence for the Founding Fathers and their philosophies in ""National Treasure,"" the answer might be ""and"" rather than ""or."" All in all, far better than I had expected. Not earth-shatteringly significant, but family-friendly, well-paced and a whole lot of escapist fun.', 'Viewing this as an English girl is most likely a completely different viewing experience to any American watching this film. starting with the typecasting of the English villain (sean bean), and continuing with the nauseatingly patriotic tone and general anti-englishness throughout (sorry, ""britishness"") (i.e. the fact that the enemy is actually designated throughout as the British, and at the end they don\'t even consider the British museum as a possible site for the treasure), I found this film terrible. The historical inaccuracies are laughable throughout and I felt like hitting Nicholas Cage every time he said the ""declaration of independence"", which, whilst I respect the declaration as an important historical document, its NOT the most important document in the whole world (how about the magna carta? Rosetta stone? dead sea scrolls???), I found myself almost hoping that they would lose it. The dialog is heavy handed throughout, and Cage\'s leaps of logic are quite astounding, especially considering the the Knights Templar aren\'t really related in any way to the Freemasons, who are throughout the world, including in england, so why would the treasure be hidden from the British if there were British Freemasons? Overall, as a movie to laugh at, and a pleasant way to spend a mindless few hours, if you can ignore the numerous inaccuracies, I would recommend this film. As a serious insight into history, I would not.', ""Here we have a classical Nicholas Cage film that will carry into the future. It is the peak of 'follow the clues' type of adventure film. The premise is just obscene enough to create this funny air over the movie and has enough twists and turns that keep the audience engaged. The villain is a very standard villain but it is nice that they nearly mirror our heroes in treasure hunting prowess. It is simple and not necessarily the most impressive but overall I would have to consider it one of the quintessential Nick Cage films."", '""National Treasure"" is a suspenseful, gripping, action packed, fast moving treasure hunt that holds your attention from beginning to end. That is, if you are ten years old. My ten year old nephew was leaning forward making the odd comment of awe throughout the film. I can say ""National Treasure"" is a fine family film for older children to enjoy with their parents. But from an adults point of view, much of this movie is plain silly. I won\'t provide spoilers, but within 15 minutes into ""National Treasure"" you will know what I mean. I agree with other viewers that this movie is an Indiana Jones wanna be. It is not ""Raiders"". Nicolas Cage, for whatever reason, provides a rather flat performance falling well short of Harrison Ford. The clues are also really far-reaching and formulaic. Connect the dots. Yet, ""National Treasure"" has redeeming value. It is family friendly, moves along at a brisk pace and has some excellent visuals. for kids: 8/10 for adults: 6/10', ""20 November 2004. National Treasure is the all-American movie about good vs. evil which is just what the American audience needs at this time in the face of America's war in Iraq. With a great dose of Lara Croft's lofty beginning theme along with Raiders of the Lost Ark sort of comedy and action adventure, throw in some nice high-tech, Enemy of the State themes and this movie is a gang-buster of a movie for the American public. It starts out with such action that it has difficulty keeping up the pace and the editing become a problem through its length and slower pace that it seems too long until the exciting climax that avoids the unbelievable ending of most movies. The romance and the nice contrast of bad guy-blow'em approach vs. the more subtle good guy approach makes this movie enjoyable. This is a great movie of the moment, for its time and audience, though not a classic by any means, it's great entertainment of the moment. Eight out of Ten Stars."", 'This was a fun movie. Nicolas Cage plays a man who has been searching for a treasure his entire life and is totally obsessed with finding it. He believes the clues lie in U.S. currency. Along the way, he drags his father, a colleague, and a lady into the fracas. He steals (borrows?) the Declaration of Independence, which provides further clues. He does indeed find clues in dollar bills, while also getting them from letters written by Ben Franklin which his father has donated to a museum and various landmarks located in Philadelphia. Along the way, there is the requisite bad guys who want the treasure too and will stop at nothing to get it for themselves. I loved this movie and you will too. It was a harmless way to spend two hours.*** out of ****', 'After sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and I wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. It was that listless and formulaic. But the U.S. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves--disappointingly--that it\'s the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, ""We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it"" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like, ""I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip"" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene. The ""reasoning"" behind each plot turn and new ""clue"" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there\'s also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being chided by all involved for ""never shutting up."" She\'s clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a ""Dr."" title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point, Cage\'s character says, ""Don\'t you ever shut up?"" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she\'s a child. Truly grotesque. The only benefit to this movie was that it\'s so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it.

Simply taking the pictures when they reach port would rob you of living in a container for days.', 'The first impression of The Meg 2: The Trench (2023) is that this was hard to watch. There were dumbfounded scenes that did not make any sense led by decision making. The kills were not that good especially since it is a PG-13 movie. The only parts that I liked are Jason Statham and his great acting and the antagonists getting killed off. Other than that, I was ready to leave the theater. It really questioned me on how does the protagonists keep on surviving after questionable events. I honestly liked the first one better because it was not that bad of a shark movie. The sequel, however, just made it worse. I am surprised that this film was allowed to make it in Dolby Cinema since it only allows good or great movies in the auditorium. Overall, The Meg 2: The Trench is pretty bad with its scenes and kills. I would recommend to stay away from this movie.', ""Don't believe these fake reviews by probably paid, semi-professional writers who say the movie is good. This movie was one big bore with no thought at all put into it. It's just a quick cash grab rebounding off the first one. You'll have more entertainment watching paint dry. I myself have more enjoyment spoon feeding my disabled, hunchbacked cousin pudding. The shark in Sharknado looks more realistic than this creation made by some CGI intern at the local community college. No cares about quality content anymore and it's sad for the avid film goer...This is an unbiased review from a real person who loves movies."", ""Meg 2: The Trench opens with what seems like a fun scene that would have been deleted from a Jurassic Park sequel for being too ridiculous and overly CGI heavy. It's followed by what seems like a hilariously goofy deleted scene from the first Transporter movie, with Jason Statham beating up nameless bad guys on a container ship. At every opportunity, Meg 2 is trying hard to please the audience with action beats, character archetypes, and scenarios that they've seen before. Half the time, this sequel simply hits similar notes as its 2018 predecessor. Despite this laziness and lack of originality, the movie still has its odd charms, making it pretty hard to hate, even if it's hard to fully appreciate on any real artistic level.As with the first film, the best thing Meg 2 has going for it is Jason Statham. Even if he may not be the best judge of scripts, Statham is still the absolute best action star Hollywood has. He has the physicality, acting chops, and charisma to make even the weakest of his films worth watching. Without Statham, Meg 2 probably wouldn't rank above a 3 or 4 out of 10, but Statham gives it his all with a so-so script and manages to make the overly long two-hour creature feature better than it would have been otherwise. The rest of the supporting cast does what they can with their roles. Nobody outright embarrasses themselves with the mediocre material.Story-wise and artistically, The Meg is the superior entry in the Meg franchise. While not necessarily a bad film, Meg 2 definitely has its fair share of dead spots, with a lot of the first hour seeming like it could have ended up on the cutting room floor. The second hour is much stronger, emphasizing the (PG-13) carnage and attacks the audience wants out of a shark flick. The film is never an absolute bore, though it's disappointing that director Ben Wheatley didn't lean more into the B-movie nature of the first ten minutes. Both Meg movies would have benefited greatly from an R-rating, though the fact that both are super CGI heavy and relatively bloodless without ever playing like Syfy originals is probably a minor miracle.Ultimately, Meg 2: The Trench isn't super memorable. It doesn't tell a particularly strong story or ever really justify its existence as a sequel. However, the opening scenes and the second half delivers the kind of mindless action spectacle one would want from a cheesy sci-fi adventure like this. In the end, it's strictly for Statham and creature feature fans only. Anyone else is likely to find it a complete waste of time. 5/10."", 'I am not sure if any movie can be dumber than Meg 2.

Forest Whitaker may be the most recognizable name in the entire cast, and he kills it every moment as his brilliant, rebellious character, Saw Gerrera.

The main hero is a woman but she isn't annoying and she isn't a super human. Nobody is a super human, there is no place for magic and the laws of physics and the force aren't violated, as neither is viewers intelligence. The plot is simple but it delivers.

Read all;"[""I first saw this in 2006 with my family in a theatre.Revisited it recently on a dvd which I own.This is the twenty-first in the Bond series and the first film to star Daniel Craig as James Bond and my first Bond film seen in a theatre.Basically it is a reboot and here we get to see an MI6 operative promoted to 00 agent status by assassinating two targets.So to achieve a licence to kill, he has to kill minimum two targets.In this one Bond pursues a bomb-maker which leads him to a corrupt official Alex Dimitrios in the Bahamas.Bond later uncovers the plot of the destruction of Skyfleet's prototype airliner by a private banker to terrorists known as Le Chiffre.This film has one of the best parkour chase sequence.It has old skool action n thankfully there is no reliance on gadgets n cgi.One of the best part is that we get to see a Bond who is inexperienced, vulnerable n his transition to a cold blooded killer is very well done. Thank God, ther is no cheeky humor.Daniel Craig in this movie is in very good shape n at times his character is believable, which can run, sprint, endure both torture n poison and sometimes who gives a damn whether its shaken or stirred, unlike his predecessors.This time Bond faces Le Chiffre n his henchmen Valenka, Alex Dimitrios, Kratt, Carlos Nikolic and one of the world's best free runner Mollaka Danso, a freelance terrorist working for Chiffre n Dimitrios.Bond also faces the machete yielding terrorist Steven Obanno n his bodyguard.Bond pursues Mr. White n faces his henchmen, the most famous being Adolph Gettler, the man with a unique glasses who gets shot in the eye.I miss those olden Bond villain's powerful henchmen.This time Bond gets to cool off with Caterina Murino n Eva Green.The film ends at a breathtaking beautiful location of Lake Como,\nthe most beautiful lake in the world for its microclimate and environment with prestigious villas and villages.It also ends with the iconic dialogue."", ""For many years, I have longed to see a James Bond series actually based on the books. While some of the Bond films have been a lot of fun, most have practically nothing to do with the great Ian Fleming novels. Sadly, in a few cases (such as YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE), about the only similarity between the books and the movies were the titles! In fact, the original CASINO ROYALE was a horrid film in practically every way except for the music. While some of the characters were retained, the movie was an abysmal mess--a very high budget and confusing mess. It was purported to be a comedy, though practically none of the film was funny and like YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, the plot was impossible to follow and bore no similarity to the book. Fans of Ian Fleming usually twitch with disgust at even hearing the title of this god-awful film--thank goodness someone FINALLY wanted to do the Fleming novel some justice!In the books, Bond was a bourbon drinking, chain-smoking assassin. CASINO ROYALE was the first book and Bond was his most human in it. In the book, Bond struggled with guilt over the many people he'd killed--and they were NOT killed in crazy and exotic ways like they were in most of the movies. Most were either shot or killed with his bare hands. Bond was, above all else, a killer--not quite as sexy or sophisticated as he was in the films. While Craig isn't quite the same as Fleming's Bond (he's missing the scar down his cheek), he's much closer to the novels than any prior Bond incarnation. I miss that Bond and am glad that, in part, the new CASINO ROYALE finally features much of this cold-blooded and flawed character.Now I do understand that EON Productions couldn't repeat the novel completely--heck, it was set in the early 1950s and many allowances needed to be made for current events. And as far as the updates went, they generally were in the same spirit as the original movie and the cat and mouse game between Le Chiffre and Bond is essentially that of the novel.All this does NOT mean that the movie will only appeal to those who read the books. There are still many exciting chase scenes and stunts like you'd expect to see in a Bond film but fortunately Bond didn't seem so invincible. Daniel Craig's version of Bond could apparently do what the prior Bonds could do, but you'll notice throughout the film that he's cut and bruised--not exactly a man of steel. I loved this and it did tend to make the unrealness of the stunts seem a tad more believable. Plus, again, Fleming would be thrilled as several stories he wrote talked about the toll on Bond's body.The film was well-constructed, stunt heavy but not enough to alienate purists like myself and intelligently written. About the only people who will strongly dislike this film are those who are looking for a reincarnation of Sean Connery or Roger Moore. Craig certainly doesn't look or act like either of these two guys. While I could easily imagine Connery's or Moore's characters sipping martinis while engaged in gay banter with their arch-enemies, Craig is more the type you'd expect to beat the enemies to death with his bare hands--like a REAL government assassin. Wow, do I like the change!PS--The Aston Martin DBS V12 in this movie is a gorgeous car and it should be with a base price of $265,000. In the film, it is destroyed and I truly hope this was a model or something other than one of these great sports cars--it would be tragic if they really did in this car!"", 'Casino Royale (2006) is without doubt one of the best Ian Fleming\'s James Bond. This is the real film, the real Bond film unlike lackluster sh**y Die Another Day stupid movie! I have enjoyed this film so damn much! I love this film to death, from action sequence to actors and the plot story I love it. The film is very realistic serious well portrayed it has no jokes. It is my favorite because it is action, action, action and even more action. Casino Royale (2006) is the twenty-first spy film in the Eon Productions James Bond film series, and is the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming\'s 1953 novel of the same name.I make no apologies for believing that Daniel Craig really did become the closest thing we\'ve seen to IAN FLEMING\'s James Bond. I\'m a hard-core James Bond fan I love a lot of the films that over 50 years were made. Casino Royale is simply my third favorite James Bond film it is in my top 10 favorite James Bond films. This movie is interesting totally mind-blowing. It is highly entertaining, espionage with a lot of action sequence. Not boring or lame but believable well acted.After lackluster fiasco and disaster Die Another Day (2002) producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli fired actor Pierce Brosnan because he wanted too much money to shoot a fifth Bond movie, and producers had already decided to reboot the long-running spy saga with a grittier approach. Daniel Craig ultimately took over the role for 2006\'s Casino Royale and has gone on to achieve success as arguably the most popular 007 since the days of Sean Connery.Daniel Craig is fantastic as new James Bond tough I love Pierce Brosnan this is the real deal. Actress Samantha Bond also left James Bond saga after 4 movies since Brosnan was fired and this movie did not used Miss Moneypenny.Eva Green as the new Bond\'s girl Vesper Lynd did an excellent performance and a fine job playing James Bond\'s first true love. Green and Craig have electric chemistry on screen together. Vesper\'s character seems ambiguous, impudent and complicated. One night-slumped in the shower fully clothed, radiating inner beauty-her quiet look is capable to melt Bond\'s cold heart and free his doubtful mind. In another, she disconcerts him with her pretty \'Algerian love knot.Judi Dench as M is always awesome and she did a fantastic well done job. In GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough and this movie she did a well done excellent job. I love the actress and I had a blast watching her on screen.Mads Mikkelsen is the villain banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who tries to get rich in supplying funds for terrorists. The actor did incredible job as the main villain and I really absolutely loved his performance.Jeffrey Wright plays the new undercover CIA agent Felix Leiter \'bleeding chips at the poker tournament:\' and Giancarlo Giannini plays the \'contact\' Mathis.The Italian actress Caterina Murino plays Solange who reveals her sexy side as the frustrated woman so upset in her marriage.Armed with a license to kill, Secret Agent James Bond sets out on his first mission as 007, and must defeat a private banker to terrorists in a high stakes game of poker at Casino Royale, Montenegro, but things are not what they seem.Bond (Daniel Craig) is chasing a terrorist bomber Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) who was contracted by terrorist organization to make and sell a bomb. While Bond chases him he has to jump on a several sky cranes and on a building to continue the chase. Real stunt performance from stunt man and actor Daniel Craig. He chases Mollaka to embassy in Madagascar and shots him and shoots a nearby gas tank makes a huge explosion and flees with Mollaka\'s bag, he finds his cell phone with text message the word ""ELLIPSIS."" A trail leads Bond to Nassau, Bahamas to Alex Dmitrios (Simon Abkarian) in which Bond seduces his wife Solange and find\'s out he goes to Miami USA. Bond pursues Dmitrios to Miami airport kills Dmitrios with a knife in self defense tracks down another bomber. Bond stops the terrorist and takes the bomb away from the airplane. Saves all the passengers and the plane. Great tanker truck chase on the airport. Great action sequence Bond saves over 200 lives in this movie that is why I love it so much. Bond stops the tanker before hitting the plane with all the gas and the bomb attached to it and he attaches bomb on a terrorist. Excellent action sequence! Bond has to fight Le Chiffre in high poker game with Felix Leiter. Bond kill\'s two black men in which Le Chiffre lost their money and single handle with fists kill\'s them. Bond is such a bad-ass in this movie. Le Chiffre and his blond girl Valenka (Ivana Milicevic) poison Bond\'s martini with digitalis, causing Bond to suffer severe tachycardia. Bond runs to his car for defibrillator but passes out. Vesper Lynd comes and save\'s his life. Bond comes back in to Casino finishes the game and beats Le Chiffre at the game. Bond drives Aston Martin DBS great action sequence.10/10 This movie is directed by Martin Campbell who directed GoldenEye my all time favorite Pierce Brosnan 007 film. Casino Royale (2006) is my third favorite film in the Bond 007 saga and I love this movie to death! I love it so damn much!', ""Now look, I'm a hard-core James Bond fan. Some might say a purist.I make no apologies for believing that Timothy Dalton is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond.Last night I saw Casino Royale.This is, for the first time, the truest interpretation of the character we have ever seen.This film is amazing. Totally mind-blowing. From the black and white pre-titles, to arguably the best titles sequence ever. From the African free-running chase to the beautiful interiors of London. From Judi Dench's harassed M, to the super cool Le Chiffre. From the stone-cold government killer, to the heart broken lover.Style and sophistication are in abundance.And I love it.Lancelot Narayan DVD Producer The Lip Sync Group"", 'Though it doesn\'t care too much about the series\' continuity (it\'s supposed to be Bond\'s first mission as a 00 agent, but it takes place after the Cold war and Judi Dench is already M), ""Casino Royale"" is a great re-creation of the series. Cool action, great thrills and a more humane Bond more than make up for the purported lack of gadgets. Daniel Craig plays Bond as a rough secret who only gradually acquires the class and cold demeanor we all know and love. He makes mistakes in the course of his mission, but that makes him even more of a hero. Although I found it hard at first to cope with Craig\'s looks, he is more than suitable as the character. Bond is portrayed as a man with flaws and weaknesses, which makes him look even stronger. The story is not your usual Bond plot and relies more on classical thrills than technology, though the action is extremely hard-boiled. Kudos to the creepy Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre and Eva Green as Vesper Lynd for creating remarkably believable characters. A definite must-see for Bond fans : it should reconcile at last Ian Fleming aficionados and fans of the film series !', ""First off, the negative. Casino Royale is both too long and too short. Like OHMSS, there are moments when the running time feels its length and others where you think something's missing because they suddenly tried to trim the running time by not shooting bits. At times you'd be grateful for a little bit of exposition BEFORE a couple of the big action scenes rather than after. And some of the script has some lines as subtle as a car crash that stink of Paul Haggis' brand of heavy handedness. The big finale is just a bit too much, as if they're afraid not to destroy some big building again because that's what they always do.Having got that out of the way, none of that matters that much because this is the best Bond since George Lazenby thought he had all the time in the world. It's got a strong plot for once and makes it even stronger by showing us where Bond came from and how he smoothed away some of the rough edges. And the edges are brutally rough here. The killings are nasty and the aftermath has to be dealt with in a way Bonds have never done before.The real ace in the hand is Craig. He doesn't have Connery's raw star quality, but he's easily the best actor to have played the part. I don't know if the film was shot in sequence but for the only time since OHMSS you get a sense of Bond changing throughout the film as his cockiness becomes confidence and his brutality becomes cold efficiency. He starts off unlikeable but human and gradually picks up the Bond traits we know until he becomes more likable but just a little less human. It's an interesting journey and Craig is up to it. It's not just his delivery, it's also his body language. Even his fighting style changes as he adapts.Physically he's the most in your face Bond since Lazenby and the action scenes look brutal for once. Even the not very likely free running chase is spectacular but believable because you get the idea that this really is kill or be killed stuff. It's got a real feel of danger to it that hasn't been seen in the series in years. Only the torture scene feels like it's holding back (it's almost as tastefully done as the old TV version) but that's probably fear of the censors.You'll come out of this one not just thinking that Daniel Craig IS James Bond, but that no-one has ever played him before. Let's all hope EON don't lose their nerve with Bond 22 and bring back the sci-fi stuff and gadgets, because this could be a real new beginning! See it and you'll believe it."", 'It is a wee bit surprising that Casino Royale is rated so high. Though its a very good smart action flick with all the works, chase and stunts and blowing up a house in Venice and you know what, but its absolutely not a Bond movie. Well, i love movies like MI, Bourne Identity, Munich, etc., but its not the same when you are making a movie based on a cult figure here. Its like Mart being remixed and played in a nightclub. Craig is a good action hero but when you are playing Bond you have to restrain yourself because for heavens sake Bond is not a cowboy. Bond is not about muscles and thats where the director misses the plot. We have been flooded with remakes and a more ""realistic"" and ""original"" portrayal of our legendary figures which is accepted as creative license, but sometimes its better to leave a few things as they are/were.', 'If you consider yourself a James Bond fan and yet enjoyed this film, there is a problem.Just like everyone else, when I first saw that Daniel Craig was to replace Pierce Brosnan in the role, I was a bit confused. His ice cold looks seemed to be quite a stretch from the image we have of James Bond. Maybe ""they"" know some things I don\'t about 007, maybe I\'ve been missing something about the character. Plus,the hype around the production was excellent,the rumor was that the filmmakers have decided to be more daring in many aspects. Nothing wrong with that, as a long as you know what you\'re doing.But at the very first frame of the film,my original skepticism re-emerged:The opening scene happens in a sombre black and white cold war setting in which Bond makes no spectacular entrance, chatting with his enemy and finishing the mission with his fists inside a...dirty public restroom. Then Bond spins around, aiming his gun at the camera, taking the classic pose. Right then, I couldn\'t help myself but noticing the restroom tiles in the background(!) and this blond muscular hunk in the center of the screen suggesting: "" I am your NEW James Bond!"". ""Not yet,gentlemen"" did I think.Still, let\'s give them a second chance, here comes the long-awaited opening credits. A beautiful animation of paisley patterns and stylized men fighting in slow-motion,turning into flying hearts,spades,clubs and diamonds at each blow. But something is missing: where are the gorgeous nude feminine silhouettes? Where are the girls? Gone !!! Why???!!! At this point, I feared the worst: did the producers decide purposely to get rid of everything we actually loved about James Bond?! But here comes hope:James Bond chases a man through a building site,climbing on cranes, jumping and falling hard. Great, this might not be a real James Bond flick, but at least, we\'re in for some good entertainment. Right?Wrong: The rest of the film is nothing but a long (two and a half hours long!)demonstration on how to annihilate a movie landmark character.No Monneypenny,no ""Q"",no ""R"", and every time ""M"" (Judi Drench) appears on the screen, the ONLY thing she ever does is begging Bond to stop doing what he\'s doing and come back to his senses. Yet,all I could hear from her was: ""What have you done to James Bond? Who are you, blond man?! Why don\'t you ever smile? Why don\'t you ever say anything witty? How come the only gadget you use is a cell phone? How dare you wreck THE 1964 Aston Martin in only 3 minutes? How could you fall in love with such a boring girl? What do you want from us? Bring us back England\'s most precious hero!""The other characters barely exist: The villain, named Le Chiffre, is a card player who\'s task is to finance terrorism by playing poker. Does he cheat ? no. Why? He might be a villain, but will not take his cruelty as far as... cheating! We know he\'s the villain since his left eye bleeds once in a while and he acts like everything is fine. Who knows,maybe someday,we\'ll get to see a villain who plays Monopoly with a runny nose. So scary.Then I thought: ""I get it! His damaged eye is in fact a technological wonder that allows him to see the other player\'s cards thanks to the mysterious blond girl, in the background, who\'s eye is a camera placed surgically inside her head and feeds Le Chiffre with her own vision! Great!"". Was I right ? Of course not, that would be something you\'d see in a James Bond film...But here comes the most sacrilegious scene EVER to come out of a James Bond film:James Bond (let\'s keep using this name, for the lack of a better one) is taken prisoner and dragged in a basement, he is entirely stripped from his clothes and attached on a chair without a seat, letting 007\'s ""genitals"" dangling from underneath (Yes,you heard right). Le Chiffre proceeds to swing a large heavy rope and hits her majesty\'s favorite secret agent\'s nuts over and over. Bond screams in pain but does not reveal the bank account number. What a man. Does he escape? Does he fight back in the most ingenious manner and eliminates his torturer? No, he passes out and wakes up in a hospital.The torture may have stopped for Bond, but increases for me: Bond finds comfort in the arms of his girlfriend Vesper (yes, girlfriend) who tells him, to rebuild his pride, that even if the only thing left from him was his little finger, she would still love him. To which, the emasculated James Bond replies (watch out, humor coming your way): ""That\'s because you know what I can do with my little finger."" Can we please stop talking about mister Bond smashed testicles and go on with this never-ending-going-nowhere-story?! And don\'t we know that if Bond was ever blown to smithereens, the only thing left from him should precisely be his genitals?There were other problems with the film of course,such as the boring story, and the fact that the casino (which seemed to be the perfect setting for a James Bond film) turned out to be so poorly exploited.Giving this film one star might not be fair (do you ever read a review unless it has a 1 or a 10 star rating?),but the main problem goes beyond the bad choices added by the filmmakers throughout the film. The problem is that the film was made with the wrong ""spirit"" and doesn\'t take in consideration that, unlike other movies, James Bond belongs more to the public than to its makers, and that this rare fact deserves to be honored.Don\'t mess with MY James Bond.', ""What a difference a great actor makes. Daniel Craig is superb as James Bond and parting from that point everything in it is enjoyable, frightening, thrilling just because we're with him. He conquered us from the word go. The initial chase is one of the best in film history and as soon as we get to know this new incarnation of the iconic Ian Fleming character, we're hooked. He's virile but there is room for ambiguity. He's elegant but as, the sensational Eva Green, points out is more acquired than inherited. More working class than even Sean Connery and that works wonders for Mr Bond. The script is more compact and organic. The locations are breathtaking and what else I can say? The series have been reinvigorated, rejuvenated and in one single stroke have secured that this franchise will live forever. A note to Barbara Broccoli, the producer, your father would be so proud. Congratulations!"", 'There is only one movie franchise that has twisted, turned and reinvented itself on so many occasions...007 has unfortunately dwindled more than it has bedazzled over the last decades but I am relieved to see that Martin Campbell has put the edge back into the Bond series.The originally unpopular Craig grinds through this action packed feature with ease and in my opinion proves all of his doubters (including me) very very wrong..At last we have another true Bond.. Sharp, sophisticated and as tough as nails... And perhaps correctly more shaken than stirred.Welcome back 007... Welcome back.', ""Daniel Craig's debut as 007 which he knocked out of the park. A very grounded, smart, realistic James Bond film. Casino Royale is debatably for most fans the best Bond film and I can honestly view this film as a movie of its own to be honest. Daniel Craig is the best bond since Sean Connery."", 'I miss the Bond I grew up with. Thought the film was about 30 minutes too long. If the goal of the producers was to take Bond back to his roots, then why bring back the actress that played M in the role for the past four films. Also, if their goal was to make Bond appeal to a younger audience then based on who I saw at the theater last night, they missed the mark. The action scenes were great and Daniel Craig is a very good actor\x85but I miss my Bond I have come to know. I must say I was disappointed in the opening title sequence. A bit cheap looking and the song was not very memorable. If you want a Bond closer to the character in the books, then Daniel Craig is it.', 'Many moons ago, my parents took my sister and I to the drive thru to see DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. I\'m sure sis and I would have preferred a Disney movie at the time, but even at our age, it was pretty impressive when Sean Connery got his Mustang up on two wheels. Between that fateful starry night and now, I have ended up seeing every James Bond movie.So the idea of working off some Thanksgiving day turkey and taking my son 30 years later to see CASINO ROYALE was fun. This movie features Daniel Craig as the new James Bond. And a new James Bond with an advertised new attitude. No more invisible cars, rocket back packs, laser beam wrist watches, or ejector seats.I had seen Daniel Craig in LAYER CAKE and MUNICH and was already a fan, and he brings great acting chops, athleticism, and toughness to the role. Supporting Craig with their own wonderful acting are Judi Dench as ""M\' and Eva Green as the female lead.And the villain of the movie? Goldfinger, Dr No, no the real villain is the pacing. The movie starts off all action, then builds the plot, then gets into the high stakes poker game and kind of bogs down. The writers even try to throw in some Idi Amin African type baddies in the middle of the poker game to break the monotony. Finally the poker game is over, and James Bond jumps in his Aston Martin to chase after the bad guys. Everyone in the movie theater straightened up in their seats for the finale. 30 seconds later, he is out of the car, with barely one fast slide through a curve.1/2 hour later the movie is still going, and at the beginning of every new scene, the people in front of me \'sigh\'. Finally the movie ends and a sigh of relief comes out of the crowd, no cheering, no applause, just relief. No one wanted to walk out in the middle, you want to see how the characters end up, but the \'natives\' were definitely restless.We walked into the theater at 7:10 and walked out at 10:00. If they would have made the movie 1/2 hour shorter and had that car chase everyone wanted for the finale, they would have made 100 million dollars more.So the verdict is keep Craig, fire the screenwriter, kudos for attempting to have James Bond grow up, now if only I would grow up.', 'When Daniel Craig was cast as Bond, unlike many I did not hold my hands up in despair, and predict a flop. I was willing to give him a chance, and certainly felt he could give something different to the role.Sadly, this film left me with an extreme sense of frustration. Perhaps due to my high hopes for the film, and the many positive reviews? And yet, it seems beyond my personal expectations. The film tried too hard to be different, the end result being an entirely different Bond film, but a very unoriginal Hollywoodised action flick.Yes Craig gave a tougher, more brutal edge to Bond, but what Hollywood action hero isn\'t tough and brutal? In fact, it was the desire for Hollywood action that ruined this film for me.For example, the scene containing free running (parkour) near the beginning epitomises the desire for great action, and little sense. If you recall, there is a moment where Bond decides to climb into some sort of demolition vehicle. Yes, it looked great as the vehicle came crashing through a concrete wall, but if we actually think about it, there was no need whatsoever? It did not achieve anything, not just in terms of film artistry, but also plot - it didn\'t help him catch the bad guy!The free running itself was another attempt by the director to wow the audience into submission, there was quite literally no point to it whatsoever. Why on earth did the villain decide to go up a crane? - ""I know, I can escape him by climbing to the top of a crane"" - No my friend you would have been better off finding yourself a car. I am not surprised this film has been received well and that it is a hit at the box office - but I\'m sorry Mr.Campbell, I see through you.I will openly admit I found the poker scenes enjoyable, and I found Mads Mikklesen\'s performance particularly enjoyable. Not a bad effort, and it does indeed breathe new life into the Bond genre, but I could quite easily go down to Blockbuster, search the action section for 5 minutes and find something just as good! Ultimately, what I found offensive about this film, was that all involved seemed to believe that if they throw a load of heavy duty action scenes at the audience to satisfy us - not this film goer I\'m afraid.. 5/10']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I wasn't overly impressed with it myself, but having seen all 6 films now, AOTC is actually a very important and well done section of the overall series.Lucas has said time and again that this movies are meant to be seen as one long film, not to be taken as 6 individual movies. This particular installment features so much that affects every other episode. The discovery of the clones, the immaturity and arrogance of Annakin, the beginning of the clone wars. All of these events happen in this one movie, which is actually a lot more than what happens in some of the other films. I don't consider this to be the best of all 6 by any means, but it is certainly not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be."", ""First off the movie had some good aspects about it. For one the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin was phenomenal. They were emotional and comedic at the same time. The second thing is the action. This movie was very action packed and the choreography in the fights were very good. The conflict was nice as well I just wish they didn't have as many sub-plots. I didn't like how unnecessarily long this movie was, it felt like 3 hours. Some scenes didn't need to be included and I didn't like how they made it seem as if Anakin was obsessed over Padme but other than that their romance was believable and cute. The acting was strong although sometimes it came off as bland. The beginning tried to be serious but ended up looking like a joke. The movie was pretty good overall but could've done better."", 'Much like its predecessor, Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones has gained a rather sour reputation on the internet. Fortunately, many of the popular complaints about this film are either highly exaggerated or downright wrong. Chapter two of the Star Wars Saga is an energized and highly enjoyable two hours at the movies.Attack of the Clones follows Anakin Skywalker ten years after his exploits in The Phantom Menace. An older Anakin, played surprisingly well by Hayden Christiansen, is now training under the watchful eye of Ewan McGregor\'s Obi-Wan Kenobi. Searching the Internet, you won\'t find many fans who praise Christiansen\'s performance, but I found him to be very effective in the young, arrogant hotshot role he\'d been given. McGregor does similarly well in the older brother, mentor role. I enjoyed Episode I a lot, but the story is much more focused this time, with major events happening for Anakin, and an actual political conflict engulfing the Republic. The two major story lines in the film are, one, the political underpinnings that eventually lead to the start of the infamous Clone Wars, and two, the personal story of Anakin Skywalker, including the romance between him and the former Queen, Padme Amidala. The first of these story lines is wildly interesting, following the two opposing forces of the Clone Wars, The Republic and their clone army, and the Seperatists and their droid battalion, as they prepare for an imminent war. After an assassination attempt on Senetor Amidala, Obi-Wan embarks on a detective mission to a track down the people behind the plot. The political espionage and behind-the-scenes dealings make for a fascinating and focused story. The other major storyline is not as focused, but still works as a chapter in Anakin Skywalker\'s overall story. Anakin and Padme\'s love story works as a throwback to the grand, old-fashioned film romances of the 1930s and 40s (think Gone With the Wind), but for contemporary audiences, the few extended scenes of corny ""love speech"" dialogue might be pretty drab. However, these aren\'t as distracting or offensive as some claim. In fact, a couple of them actually work well, such as the meadow picnic, where Padme and Anakin discuss the futility of politics in the beautiful fields of Naboo. The actors have chemistry, and both are likable, especially Natalie Portman as Padme. Yes the love story can be a bit forced, and sometimes drab, but it fits the feel of the saga. It is a grand, sweeping, throwback to Hollywood\'s golden age.If the love story might be hit or miss, it\'s the other facet of Anakin\'s character arc that Lucas gets absolutely right. Plagued by visions of his mother in pain, Anakin takes Padme to Tatooine where he tracks down his mother, only to see her die in his arms. His response is chilling and powerful. The scene between him and Padme in a garage after he brings his mom\'s body back is perfectly executed, unveiling a dark, angry side of Anakin, while simultaneously showing his frailty and confusion. It truly is one of the very best scenes in the saga.Even if you didn\'t find the story as interesting as I did, there is no question that Episode II is an audio/visual feast for the senses. Lucas and company introduce a stunning variety of sprawling landscapes, crazy creatures, fanciful vehicles, and formidable weapons. Once again, the sheer amount of imagination contained in this world is unbelievable.

Scott Rosenberg's witty script boasts a lot of snappy one-liners along with a wickedly funny sense of self-mocking sardonic humor.This film further benefits from a colorful and entertaining array of deliciously detestable villains: Ving Rhames as black militant Diamond Dog, Steve Buscemi as flaky and philosophical psycho Garland Greene, Nick Chinlund as the surly Billy Bedlam, M.C Gainey as easygoing good ol' boy pilot Swamp Thing, and Dave Chappelle as wisecracking lackey Pinball. Moreover, there are sound contributions from John Cusack as eccentric smartaleck US Marshalls agent Vince Larkin, Colm Meaney as bullheaded DEA agent Duncan Malloy, Mykelti Williamson as Poe's affable buddy Baby-O, Rachel Ticotin as sassy guard Sally Bishop, and Steve Eastin as sarcastic guard Falzon. The roaring and rattling score by Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin does the rousing trick. David Tattersall's glossy widescreen cinematography likewise hits the impressive polished spot. However, it's this movie's giddy willingness to go totally over the top and then some that makes it such a gloriously gonzo blast to behold."", '""Con Air"" can best be described as ""The Rock"" in the sky.  The film deals with a Gulf War veteran (Nicolas Cage) who becomes a victim of circumstance and is sentenced to eight years in prison.  He is going home via a gigantic prison plane which is also carrying some very unsavory characters (John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi among others).  Of course the evil prisoners take over the plane and it is up to Cage to save the day.  Overall this is a fine action film which keeps its focus on the characters.  4 out of 5 stars.', ""Not only was Con Air the best movie of 1997, it is an all time pleaser. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and laughing the whole time.  With non stop action and hundreds of classic one-liners, this movie just can't lose. A must see for people of all ages and genders!!!!"", ""Con Air is just simply mindless entertainment! The script is full of hard-as-nails characters, each nicely developed to melodramatic point, with Nicholas Cage's con the moral centre. The only exception probably being Steve Buscemi's Ed Gein-esquire Garland Green who offers a slight variation on what we come to expect as your typical lifer con! O.K, so the plot does have a few holes that need filing and the whole thing is pretty unoriginal but the ridiculousness of the premise does call for some suspension of disbelief. It may have been best played tongue-in-cheek but the great-one liners, insane situations, brilliant staged, if overblown action sequences and a great guitar score by Trevor Rabin, still make for a white-knuckle two hours.7/10"", ""John Malkovich gives a ground breaking performance as Cyrus the Virus in this movie and you won't find a similar performance anywhere else. He and John Cusak actually overshadow Nicholas Cage for the most part of this movie. This movie is just filled with so many things that will keep you entertained and amused from start to finish, leave you extremely satisfied and force you to come back and watch the movie all over again. You also wont find such a huge assembly of stars in most other movies either. The same guys wont shy to display their attitudes as well. The story is good and the action is even better. The cinematography and screenplay are also top notch. This movie was a box office hit and I can't understand why its rated so low?"", ""Oh how could I forget about this movie?! This is the kind of flick I enjoy watching during a hang over because it defines perfectly the action movie clichés. What am I talking about? Well, it delivers an easy to follow plot where the good guy has to fight against the villains, where there is sentimentalism (that dirty rabbit doll is a low punch for those who easily get sentimental or cry), badass villains, very good f/x, cheesy one-liners (Cy...onara please?) a decent score, and of course, the typical plot where everything has to de destroyed. Nicholas Cage is fine this time although the movie didn't recquire a demanding acting level. John Malkovich steals the show as always in this badass performance. Monica Potter is super sexy and cute at the same time";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.In conclusion, this movie is completely overrated, also, definitely not the best movie of the year, not even in the top ten, not even the best movie of superheroes of this year and even though the academy nominated it for best picture it is still overrated.

Since when did we decide to water down the truth for children, and when exactly are they old enough for certain issues, and why is it animation means it\'s suppose to be for children. Animation has allowed movie makers to break molds, has allowed them to do things that could not be done with regular actors or locations. We use CGI to accomplish effects we otherwise couldn\'t do, why is the art of illustration not considered on the same level as the art of computer graphics? I don\'t feel that just because something is made for children it should be dumbed down and I don\'t believe that an adult is too superior to watching something that is animated.

Time travel is handled quite well in this Australian film, focusing less on the effects of travelling back (and forth) in time than other sci-fi films. ""Predestination"" uses decidedly odd pacing, beginning with a \'bang\' and following that up with almost an hour of subdued plot. But oddly enough, these moments of -almost- pure dialogue and occasional flashbacks never become boring, but rather deepen the film\'s characters and their back-stories. The cast performances are what really make this movie \'shine\'. Ethan Hawke, as usual, delivers an almost flawless performance as the unnamed lead, and Sarah Snook, an Australian newcomer, surprises with her wide range of acting abilities. Overall, the third feature film by the Spierig Brothers is a surprisingly original, daring, and genre-bending film.', ""Sadly I had to travel to an old and tiny cinema to see this movie as it didn't play in the major cinemas on the Gold Coast...after watching this movie i have absolutely no clue why.I truly enjoyed every minute of this film, all of the actors did a great job, especially Ethan Hawk. I did see some of the plot lines coming and still got a bit of a surprise in how they delivered those plot lines...if you get a chance and like a sci-fi with brains then go and watch this!!!I would definitely not compare it to looper (just to add to the end) yes looper and predestination are about time travel, but thats were it ends... :)"", ""I don't know why this movie has such a low rating, 7 is worse than 9 ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Habacon, Oscar Isaac, Greta Lee;Teen Miles Morales becomes the Spider-Man of his universe and must join with five spider-powered individuals from other dimensions to stop a threat for all realities.;"['As much as I enjoy this movie (and as an animator/storyartist I love the visuals!) I have to honest and say it is a bit of an unfocused mess. The reason why you should see this movie is because it is the first in what will hopefully be a trend of innovative and creative animated movies that aren\'t just looking over the shoulders of what Disney and Pixar are doing. This movie is its own creature and I think it deserves to be seen just for the visuals and the opportunity to hopefully support this trend...However, I would only say that if the movie has some substance to it.... which it does. I recommend people see this movie, but it should be noted that I think this movie may be getting the ""Kubo"" treatment where an animated film is visually impressive to such a degree that people gloss over bad writing because everything they are looking at is so cool.The first half of this movie is brilliant. I think just about everything in the first half works really well and is super effective. Miles Morales felt like a real kid with some real kid issues, Peter B Parker was funny, tragic and fleshed out, and Gwen... existed (we\'ll get to her later). My eyes were glued to the screen and I was excited for where the story would go as I was genuinely surprised at a couple twists and turns in the story.Then, a certain moment happened in the movie where I was taken out of the film and went, ""Wait... oh shoot this is going downhill real fast."" It was the introduction of all of the other spider-verse characters. At that moment the film shifted gears into an entirely different film from the first half. Does Miles Morales fit in with the professionals? Can Miles Morales impress them? Everyone seems to hate him due to his lack of experience! Can Miles Morales take a leap of faith (which he already did in the beginning of the movie)??!?! Is Miles Morales even relevant to the story?!?!?!?! All of these sudden new themes and plot developments completely derail what the first half of the film was setting up to such a degree that it felt like a giant schism cut through the film and the second half of the film was waving goodbye to the first half.I\'ll be clear that I have no issue with other spider-verse characters sharing screen-time in the film, the issue is that they don\'t add much in terms of character development or interaction with Miles. The characters should serve to help Miles grow, but in this movie they just seem like another pair of fists to punch bad guys, and there is no better example of this than...Gwen Stacey.Gwen Stacey has the unfortunate issue of being completely irrelevant to the story when she should be an important and vital character to Peter B Parker\'s/Miles Morales\' character growth and should have an arc of her own. This is a character who witnessed Peter Parker (her best friend) die and Peter B Parker is someone who witnessed Gwen Stacey die in her universe! WHY DON\'T THEY DISCUSS THIS!!! Peter B Parker should be surprised and excited to see someone he knew as dead alive again and she should be happy to see her best friend once more! Instead, the two characters just... punch bad guys... like everyone else. No growth or development between the two.To make matters worse, Gwen doesn\'t even really work to help Miles Morales develop as a character. In the beginning of the film she is built up to be one of the main characters, but in the second half she doesn\'t develop any further than she did in the beginning. She experiences no character growth nor does she help develop any other characters. She just exists in the film.I could go on for a while about all of the different weird pacing issues in the second half of the film such as Miles Morales suddenly getting super powerful and skilled out of nowhere (it\'s odd that people complain about ""Mary Sues"" in film but don\'t complain about Miles Morales going from zero to hero in one scene), or a single cut from a comedy scene to a tragic ""friends splitting up"" scene, some loose character threads such as Miles\' dad telling cops to chase spider-man but we never see them do it, and many other instances of odd pacing choices and poor juxtapositions of emotional story beats.But, I will end this on a positive note: All of the characters are enjoyable when they get their moment and I think the writing on the father was really good. He wasn\'t your typical ""larger than life"" father but a very honest, strong, but stubborn dad who has his flaws yet is very likable and reasonable. I wish him and Uncle Aaron had some scenes together and their dynamic was a bit more fleshed out, but as is I still like them regardless of the additional scenes they deserved.Go see it if you want to support innovative and risky animation, but be warned that it is not a perfect film (other than visually).', 'Amazing movie. Great animation, the best Spider-Man movie in my opinion', ""A movie worthy of Stan Lee's approval. Incredible animation, great story, great message. This film lives up to the hype and honestly surpassed my expectations. The only reason I think there are some negative reviews is because you can never please everyone. However, for the vast majority of viewers, I believe you'll find this film to be great. Highly recommend seeing it in theaters just for the amazing animation style."", ""There's hardly anything I would improve about this film. The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, characters, pace, humor and animation are all some of the best I've ever seen in any film";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I was utterly disappointed with the previous potc movie (#4). I went to watch this new one with a lot of prejudice.\nBut luckily it was an epic and fun movie to watch! Extremely entertaining and connected with Verbinski's style and work. Lots of beautiful action scenes, nice landscapes, humour and never ever, at any point boring. Jack Sparrow is definitely back in great form.\n8/10"", 'As a big fan of the franchise essentially made from a Disneyland Ride the first 3 films were roaring successes and ""On Stranger Tides"" we saw a movie that just didnt quite come together and this is essentially in the same ballpark. The story sort of mirrors the first and the return of Will and Elizabeth with their son and Barbossa\'s daughter going after Poseidon\'s trident whilst new villaint Captain Salazar on the chase for Jack after his release from the devils triangle had the makings of another fun film but with no Hans Zimmer composing the score or Gore Verbinski in the director chair it didnt quite reach the higher levels, maybe time to stop now.', ""With poor plotting, inconsistent pacing and a rushed sense of chemistry amongst the new cast Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales exposes the swashbuckling sequel as nothing more than a cash-grab that's as hollow as the ships they occupy."", ""The Pirates franchise has been a bit of a doozy since it's shocking box office success way back in 2003. Curse of the Black Pearl was never meant to house a sequel, as it was an open-and-shut swashbuckler flick that was heavy on energy, action, humor, and blockbuster soul. It garnished tons of Oscar nominations (and money), upped Johnny Depp's persona several notches, and helped give Disney the box office crown in 2003. 14 years later we see the fifth installment, with the second consecutive attempt at creating a new Will/Elizabeth love story, the second consecutive attempt to replace the underrated director of the original trilogy Gore Verbinski, and once again taking the crown as arguably the most expensive film shoot in cinematic history.Production hell doesn't begin to describe the attempts to create the fifth movie, even though On Stranger Tides was met with very poor reviews. Johnny Depp refused the original idea, which would have featured a female villain for the first time. Johnny Depp was going through a nasty divorce and got injured, delaying the shoot even longer. Disney and Bruckheimer were arguing about costs, and the script itself (which is a disaster we can describe later) was undergoing changes and multiple hands. And I'll still never understand how the writer of Rush Hour 3, Speed 2, and Tower Heist managed to get his hands on such a big film. Oh Hollywood\x85 The only company willing to cling on to a sinking ship of a film is Disney, simply because their patience constantly gets rewarded, and it's impossible to discontinue a franchise that has earned them a nasty 3.8 billion within only four films. So after epic struggling for many years, we finally see Dead Men Tell No Tales gracing the screen.Not going to lie, this film is an entertaining mess, and part of the wave of recent sequels/prequels that went through similar production issues which affected the final product. Alien: Covenant went through tons of trouble, and then we see Fate of the Furious have to find a way to edit out the obvious tension between Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel. But the Pirates franchise is more than just a cluster of movies, its part of the Disney fandom culture, it has a life of its own through video games, books, and mysteries and intrigue surrounding it all. So copying, abandoning and contradicting plot elements of the original trilogy gives this movie a layer of frustration we didn't need, and we definitely don't deserve after such a long wait. Even after the entertaining first half, it all gets damaged by the unmet potential and by the awkward familiarity of the plot. And this comes from the Disney Company, a film studio notorious for being vigorously detailed with all of its IPs, from Marvel to (especially) Star Wars.Another curse that doesn't allow the cursed to touch land? Sounds familiar. Woman who doesn't believe in the oceanic supernatural mumbo-jumbo? Sounds familiar. A person who denounces pirates suddenly becomes one? Also sounds familiar. British navy trying to conquer the seas from the pirates? Heh, okay. The entire plot line felt very similar to Curse of the Black Pearl, yet this installment felt like it was tapping the brakes far too much. This watered down and clownish Jack Sparrow didn't perform any swordplay once, he didn't trick anyone a single time, I don't think he even delivered any clever quips of any kind. The villain didn't have a final showdown against Jack, as we witness a CGI-laden chase as our climax, a far cry from the dizzying mayhem during the big showdown in Dead Man's Chest. Worst of all, we didn't get the dramatic showdown between the enemy ships and the Flying Dutchman, the ship that you know, controls the damn seas, and has a captain that's related to someone that is in danger throughout the film! The potential was there, and wasn't met. From script to direction to storytelling decisions, Dead Men Tells No Tales has us wishing for the original writing team and the original director to somehow bring this franchise back to decent waters. This film only further enhances At World's End and Dead Man's Chest—two films that were met with ho-hum reviews but have honestly aged well and remain better than most of your modern-day blockbusters. The script here opens the door for many intriguing scenes, and they didn't deliver. We could have explored Jack Sparrow's aging and increasing alcoholism, Barbossa's past, the Flying Dutchman/Salazar curse connection, the fallout of the elongated separation of Will and Elizabeth, and the series-shifting scene of breaking every curse. And after seeing this, I don't have much hope in the eventual sixth installment touching these story lines either.The Pirates of the Caribbean series now looks like its more interested in the international box office receipts and just keeping people entertained above keeping the flavor of the franchise and keeping a continuity between each chapter. On Stranger Tides, despite the mediocrity, had interesting unresolved story lines that were completely neglected here. The original trilogy's details don't match up with the backstory of Jack Sparrow in Dead Men Tell No Tales.You will see some high-budget fun, comical mayhem, a good performance by Javier Bardiem, but it all gets evaporated when we reach the series-changing yet series-contradicting final act. The franchise is far from being dead, but boy it might be time to let this ship disappear out into the horizons unless we get a superior cast writing and filming it. Jack Sparrow and all his fans deserve much better.Blog: https://coffeeandscriptblog.wordpress.com/"", 'After watching with very low expectations to ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"", it is hard to understand the legion of haters that write in IMDb. The film is not a masterpiece but is funny, entertaining, with great cast, special effects, screenplay and story. Johnny Depp performs the wolf, drunken and smart Captain Jack Sparrow in the usual funny way. Cinema lovers of fantasy-adventure genre must ignore the bad reviews and question what this kind of people that writes that the movie is not good like to see or if they have difficulties to understand a story with many characters. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Piratas do Caribe: A Vingança de Salazar"" (""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Revenge of Salazar"")', ""Masterpiece.

Shown on the phone. The lead star. Michael doesn\'t seem to be much older then mid 20\'s. So do your math on how old he was since he got her.The janitor is also a trainer. And Cynthia\'s character also seems to be in the exact same place. Seems a bit weird they can just go everywhere and Matthias\' character doesn\'t bother that at all.I liked the scenes with Kurt, mostly. But it felt he almost leant towards a love relationship with Lea. They got very close together.The fighting characters and scenes is pretty much Bloodsport all over again. We got the Muay Thai, Cowboy Billy, Caproeira, Kung Fu, etc. We just lack the Sumo guy.The fights were done quite alright. But it did took a lot of time, and training, and drama, to actually get there. And went over in a flas.The Dracko guy was really over the top. Too much drama. The fights also seem pretty hasty. And over the top with all the blood spewing about. Dracko was weird, it felt at first like he was some untamed monster. Creeping about in the gym, intimidating people. And even to Matthias\' character he wasn\'t really friendly.At some point in the fights we get the thumb up thumb down parts. And he actually listened to not kill someone. Which seems out of character.The fate of the survivors seem pretty weird too. Would be silly not to just kill them off by gunshot. Matthias didn\'t have problems killing people.Also, when you\'re told that the police is in on everything. You don\'t go there asking for help. You don\'t know the concequences. Most \'good\' guys made lots of mistakes. I liked they actually hired actors who know their way of fighitng.

There is nothing in this that even remotely seems like effort was involved. It is the paint by numbers version of a martial arts movie which would be fine if it was made on tight budget by a studio but this was crowd funded yet so little effort was put in. It's not unwatchable but it is also just poor even for 'this' type of movie."", 'I recently watched ""The Last Kumite"" and was unfortunately left feeling very disappointed. Despite being involved in the film myself, I only had 20 seconds of screen time, which was far less than what I was initially promised. This, however, was only the beginning of the film\'s problems.The overall production quality was subpar, reflective of a very low-budget level. The acting was stiff and uninspired, making it difficult to connect with or feel any empathy or sympathy for the characters. This lack of engagement is a critical flaw, especially in a genre that relies heavily on the audience\'s investment in its characters.The fight scenes, which should be the highlight of any martial arts film, were poorly choreographed. Many of the main characters clearly lacked the necessary martial arts skills, making their fight sequences lackluster and unconvincing. The camera angles, particularly for showcasing impressive kicks, were poorly chosen, seemingly downplaying the skills of certain performers to maintain focus on the main characters. This was particularly evident during my own fighting sequences, where it felt like the cinematography was deliberately trying not to highlight my moves.There were a few redeeming moments, notably from Mike Möller. His brief fight scenes demonstrated how martial arts should be portrayed on screen, though it was a shame they were so short. Additionally, the Capoeira performers showcased skillful techniques that stood out positively.Overall, the rest of the cast\'s performances suggested that almost anyone could have been cast in this underwhelming film. It\'s a shame, as I had much higher expectations for ""The Last Kumite."" Unfortunately, it failed to deliver on nearly every front.Rating: 2/10.', ""I found this movie because of Jason Brant's youtube channel.

Wow..so hot both of them still after all these years. Someone wrote that it should have happened in Asia, I disagree. It would have been silly with this cast. This brought back a lot of nice memories, I hope it does for you too! : )"", 'A movie for fans from fans. Made with love for martial arts cinema. Very well executed martial arts scenes. The plot is trivial, but the characters are well-defined. The main character played well and was likeable. I was very impressed with his physical abilities. The supporting characters work very well. I was impressed by some of the players, especially the YouTuber VikingSamurai, who played one of the fighters. His skills and funny charisma made me eager to see him in more action films. Matthias Hues also deserves attention, he clearly had a great time playing in this film. It was nice to see the old guard of action cinema Billy Blanks, Cynthia Rothrock and Kurt McKinney supporting the main character, they looked great. Despite a few plot flaws and a small budget, the film is well made.', ""Great very acrobatic fights, phenomenal music, thanks to Paul Hertzog and Stan Bush, pretty good story for a martial arts film as well. Of course, it is not 100% clean, perfect film, due to the budget, but that isn't actually a problem because they cover it up well enough that it is till very enjoyable, so power to them. It perfectly captures the theme of 80's and 90's martial arts films from Van Damme, Bolo Yeung, etc. The music...I cannot even tell you how good the music is in this film, Stan Bush did amazing despite his age. It has a lot of Bloodsport 2 mood to it, which I also liked. Kurt Mckinney did great, I feel like there could've been a better main role actor than Mathis Landwher, but he wasn't too bad. The training montages are amazing, the music over it and all. The fights remind me a lot of early 2000's martial arts movies fights due to them being very acrobatic and fast like Undisputed and Ong Bak. So overall, amazing movie."", ""This film is so cheesy and if you never knew what year it was made in you would think it was in the 80's.The acting is very very poor and the plot is obvious from start to finish.With all that said this was a very entertaining watch which had me glued to the screen and had throw back nostalgia all the way through.This film was a cross between kickboxer with Van damn and Enter the Dragon with the late great Bruce Lee - in referring to the story line plot and not the quality of fighter by the way!If you are an old school martial art fan and want a quick action film then look no further!!"", '""The Last Kumite"" is a major disappointment on multiple fronts. The directing by Ross W. Clarkson lacks any creativity or coherence, leaving scenes feeling disjointed and poorly paced. The editing is equally subpar, with jarring cuts that disrupt the flow of action and narrative. Sound design is another glaring issue, featuring inconsistent audio levels and poorly integrated sound effects that detract from the immersion. The casting choices are puzzling, as many of the actors, despite their martial arts credentials, deliver wooden and uninspired performances. The acting is universally poor, with stilted dialogue and a lack of emotional depth, making it difficult to connect with any of the characters. Overall, ""The Last Kumite"" fails to capture the spirit of classic martial arts films, offering instead a bland and hopefully forgettable experience.', ""A decent action film with better than expected production values with a good ensemble cast with martial arts film stars from the 80s, including a promising new face and formidable martial artist, David Kurzhal (AKA Viking Samurai) in his debut film. In my opinion he would have been better cast in the lead role as he has a stronger physical and screen presence than the lead protagonist, although the lead actor did a decent job. Looking forward to David's upcoming films in production, in which hopefully he will be given a more prominent role with more screen time. The film is an homage to the 80s action films and recreates this genre well. The fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed, the film is well paced and the character development is well done. The filming locations are exotic and picturesque and unlike most films with a limited budget, this film is good enough to merit a theatrical release."", 'Hero spends 1 hour (boring) of the movie training, barely any fight scenes. Whats also terrible, is the trainer and the healer, both work for the Promoter (bad guys boss)... but Promoter does nothing to stop the trainer/healer from training hero and they even sit on the hero\'s side of the bench during the fights. At one point, the Promoter even says to them ""your on the wrong side"" but I guess he will still pay trainer to mop his floors and healer to do whatever she does lol.All the ""good guys"" also look like they\'re in their 40\'s and 50\'s.The only female hero is able to also throw guys twice her weight around after she\'s been lifted in the air is very unbelievable.I was also hoping for a better fight between Dracko and Viking Samurai. Felt like it was 10 seconds and 1 hit punch. Lame.It also seems like Dracko has only done about 5 ""moves (kicks/punches)"" in the whole movie.The dialoge can be super cringe at times, for example, bad guy kills the first guy in the kumite:hero: that was jus straight up murder.His trainer: that is what they came here for.His healer: you must destroy him.Like the Avatar Airbender movie from 2000, where its 90% dancing to lift and shove a rock at the bad guys, this follow suit:The hero get up from his bench, takes off his robe, slowly walks past the camera, turns around, bows to his trainer, then to his healer, then bows to the opponent, bows to refreee.... LIKE COME ON AND JUST GET TO THE FIGHT SCENE. What a waste of film, should\'ve cut those scenes.', 'This is with 4.9 stars the most overrated film I have ever seen.Acting: Think 80ies porn movie actors without the porn\nStory: Inconsistent, implausible and weird. Ja, like a porn movie without the porn.Choreography: Well, not a Bruce Lee movie. It has mostly the grace of a WWF show. The martial arts are a bit of a mixed bag of mostly mediocre and very bad. The villain of the story has a couple moments that were great. Involuntarily funny but very much so.Overall this was a bizarrely bad movie. But it would have been an average/acceptable porn movie for special interest groups, if there was porn.Guys I have a hard time getting over this thing that is advertised as a movie.', 'I think it was very well done. Hits all the points of a old school Martial Arts film, good career move on Billy Blanks for being the mentor, very well done fights are awesome, villains were very well acted. Cynthia even got her kick in. The twist with The Viking Samurai Character was very done. The amount of people from those late 80s to early 90s Martial Arts film. The music is very very Bloodsport and Kickboxer. All the acting is very good. The poly was little funny with the kidnapping of the people kids and wifes. The villain they had to fight as the bolo young or tong Po was very imtating.', ""This movie is such a great Project and really\nhad me excited.Unbelievable that fans where actually responsible for this.Music Great\nFighting Great\nStory just a side note like back in the days\nBringing so many legends back and having no money\nto shoot the film truly shows what passion is about.If people can't appreciate this, then it truly shows\nthe current state of the world.I, how ever really enjoyed the film and it was\na good change to the bad stuff I see in the cinemas now a days. These people here really gave it their all, which I could see and feel.This is truly a fan service film\nThanks guys."", 'The soundtrack is beautiful, the movie needs a better directors cut or something. Some scenes/dialogues are overacted, too funny, too shocking and give cringe moments. The training scenes should be more entertaining/interesting and the kumite fights longer. Overall it is ok and we should support such martial arts movies. For me the soundtrack is a real treasure of this movie. Mathis played his role ok, but he needs a more unique fighting style/trademark to become an unique recognizeable star. Biggest recommendation here is to do test screenings with a test audience to improve the cut and delete bad scenes.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I didn\'t see the need for it and couldn\'t possibly see it at the same quality and style as the first one. Expectations sank even lower when I found about the cast. And then, 2 years later, I finally watched and, surprise, it\'s fun. It isn\'t something that will make you rolling on the floor from laughing or make you cry, but it\'s an enjoyable ride, actors actually aren\'t bad and wooden, so you will find yourself grinning a lot, particularly at the male part of the cast, which is awesome, especially Kevin Hart. Watch it with a good friend or a loved one and enjoy. It\'s not a masterpiece, but it\'s not just a dumb Hollywood blockbuster either. 8/10', ""I took one look at the trailer and was certain it would be rubbishFinally watched it on TV and was surprised that it's good solid family entertainment.Not outstanding but a respectable 7 stars."", ""This is such a dumb movie but honestly that's what makes it so great. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously and it shows. Of course it's a twist on the original Jumanji movie that will never capture the same magic. But for everyone expecting it to be a giant flop, it ends up being pretty fun.3.5/5. Above expectations."", 'We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of this remake. The jokes are nonstop and witty. Characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of Jumanji. A little homage is paid to Alan Parrish at the beginning of the movie, and the movie continues, 20 years after the events of 1996.The Rock is always fun, but shines as a scared nerd with no confidence. Karen Gillan is adorable as the socially awkward nerdy girl. Jack Black playing a self obsessed popular girl is laugh out loud funny. Kevin Hart as a shrunken jock with many assigned weaknesses is classic. All in all a nearly perfect family comedy that rises above lowest common denominator humor. Worth the trip to see it on the big screen. You do not have to see the original to appreciate it. Not quite 10 stars because adult re-watch value is just not there.', 'The wrong idea - to compare with the adaptation of 1995. Because it is not better or worst but different. Proposing a decent solution, far to be original, mixing humor and adventure , using the dream of many teenagers to become the better version of theirs and a good dose of special effects. Jungle, not awful dialogues, good performances and exploration of a familiar universe. Nothing memorable. But enough for a not boring afternoon and, maybe, for the inner child. It is fun and the cast represents the basic source of seduction.', 'With Robin Williams (RIP), a young Kirsten Dunst, Bonnie Hunt and others. \nThey had a nice notion of making a comedic espect of it using ""body swap"" (the big muscular in the game is actually a weak nerd in real life, the popular girl is a middle aged man etc. - that\'s pretty much it.Like this game, some things should be left alone .', 'Jumanji 1995 has many memorial moments for example: The reveal of the Jumanji board, monkeys robbing a police car, the stampede, sinking floors, the flooded room with some crocodiles, the incredible use of the sound track, basically a lot of stuff. The original is well crafted and now it\'s 2017 and we have Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. It\'s a fun, action comedy film with really cool references to the first film but as much as it entertains me it\'s not Jumanji. As Robin Williams said ""I\'ve seen things you\'ve only seen in your nightmares"" but in this film the jungle is safe enough to make margaritas and have scented candles on display. Dwayne Johnson tries to play a geeky character but he still plays that big tough guy. Kevin Hart plays himself nothing new, Karen Gillan plays a geeky shy girl and she has done that before and finally the highlight of the film is Jack Black playing as a teenage girl named Bethany. Everything Jack says is incredibly funny and will leave you falling off your seat. Like I said before it\'s not Jumanji, 6.5/10.', ""I will admit from the outset I was concerned about this. The original Jumanji is pretty incredible and I was worried that the use of The Rock may distract from the clever elements of the film.\nTo The Rock's credit it doesn't. You clearly notice him in it but he doesn't overpower the film.The sidekicks are a big part of the success here, it allows for more depth and humour to be spread across the film.The should be proud of the effort here in building a new legacy and not diminishing the original.Fun for all :)"", 'A modern twist provides a decent afternoon filler, end climax scene might be a bit OTT, but film watchers should expect nothing less from a movie featuring Dwayne Johnson.', ""Saw via an early Unlimited Screening.

Aaron Eckhart has made some solid movies lately, but this is defnitely not one of them!"", ""If you like the type of movies with some simple plot that tries to sound complicated and some shooting and cars flipping that you have seen many times but somehow you always enjoy the next one than this is a movie for you.Aaron Eckhart does good, Olga Kurylenko is only a minor role she has maybe 20 minutes screen time but it's always nice to see her she is still one of the most beautiful women ever.Gun go bang, car go vroom then boom. I am satisfied.There is no superfluous sex scene, the violence isn't particularly graphic it's mostly people getting shot with gun, I would say 10 year olds can watch no problem."", ""I watched this the other day and enjoyed the movie. I like Aaron Eckhart as an actor and I haven't really been disappointed in any of the films he stars in or co-stars in. I thought this film had a pretty good and known cast including Olga Kurylenko, Alex Pettyfer and Daniel Bernhardt. The did not have the look of a cheesy Sci-fi channel movie, it looked of quality.

She was also a Chief of Station but they did not discuss their cases with each other. The CIA is investigating Benjamin. His son Nick (Chris Petrovski) is joining as IT. Benjamin goes rogue with his own investigation making discoveries that lead him down a different path.I am not sure why they keep making this kind of film.

Aaron Eckhart's not lead material and there were no twists because we could see everything coming. Another point, Ben's gets his son with no experience to face the assassins straight on and shoot at them, surely he'd be better off being the shooter and the son driving, but why didn't the assassins hit him."", 'I sat down to watch the movie chief of station because I really enjoy Aaron Eckhart. The movie started out great. The back-and-forth play between seasoned espionage agents was fun to watch. Then the ""action"" started. The storyline itself was somewhat interesting, but what drove me up the wall were the action scenes. In one fight between Aaron Eckhart and the lead bad guy, they beat the crap out of each other on a boat to the point The bad guy gets hit with what appears to be some kind of metal object three times in the face And falls overboard. The very next scene, he is wet to be sure, but not a mark on him.Similarly with Aaron Eckhart. Not a mark on his face. Then there are the ridiculous gun battles. His untrained son is shooting at a car with trained assassins. The cars are 1 Foot apart and no one can hit anything even with high-powered automatic weapons. His son who didn\'t even know how to use the gun somehow knows how to use the grenade launcher to do away with the bad guy.I hope Aaron Eckhart is not heading into Bruce Willis and Nicolas Cage career choices. The only good thing about this movie is it is an hour and a half long. At least I didn\'t waste over two hours.', ""This was a wonderful movie. The pace was perfect from story lines blending together in a dynamic of bold characters, charismatic espionage and political hierarchy to deep matters of love, loyalty, revenge and ambition.

Eckhart is the star, of course, but arguably his main co-stars are the gorgeous locations in Hungary. After watching this film, I want to visit Budapest.

A certain freshness, the haunting presence of the protagonists, their actually indispensable interaction, memorable climaxes.

The dramatic arc of the characters is much more solid and clear, Vincent Cassel as always does not need many minutes to demonstrate his stage presence, François Civil finishes shaping a rising D'Artagnan, but who steals the screen every time he appears is Eva Green, who from start to finish makes a truly impeccable hero-villain game.A real pleasure to enjoy an epic film project far from the great arms of Hollywood."", '""The Three Musketeers"" by Alexandre Dumas comes to life in the cinematic adaptation, which, while deviating in some details from the book, manages to preserve the original work\'s essence. The story follows D\'Artagnan and his loyal friends, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, in a captivating 17th-century setting. Political intrigues, thrilling duels, and secret romances intertwine as they battle against the cunning Cardinal Richelieu and the enigmatic Milady de Winter. Although poetic licenses result in more battles than in the book, the film successfully captures the spirit of adventure, action, and romance that has made this classic swashbuckling tale endure.', 'Reviewed by FilmMining101:The second part in the latest (French) ""The Three Musketeers"" adaptation begins at a breathtaking pace from exactly we were left off. Showing a (rather long) recap of the first film, this feels like the penultimate episode if you will (more on that later), where all the alliances and betrayals set up in the previous installment begin to pay off.However, despite the production\'s undeniable panache, ""Milady"" suffers from the middle chapter syndrome focusing more on layering further confrontational blueprints instead of tidying up loose plot threads. And although it promises us more Milady, make no mistake, this is still very much D\'Artagnan\'s motion picture. For that reason, the generous two hour epic still cannot find time for the titular three musketeers who are treated like side characters within their own movie - especially Porthos. The actual antagonists continue to remain hidden in the shadows while Comte de Rochefort disappointingly never shows up or even been mentioned (!), a choice bound to cause displeasure between avid literature fans. Nevertheless, the incorporation of a surprising arc for Vincent Cassel\'s Athos does keep the momentum going across two films now with appropriate dramatic gravitas elevating the stakes instead of a wishy-washy, clean cut approach to heroic antics.As for the French-British goddess, Eva Green chews fancifully the scenery content with delicious satisfaction, her upgraded Milady de Winter has an expanded backstory and while she might not be the main lead, she is the chief antagonist/frenemy here getting a solid chunk of the action whether she is stabbing dogs or fighting viciously her way out of a burning stable under exceptional stuntwork. Constantly playing (and perhaps) gaining our sympathies, Green\'s Milady is a three dimensional role dressed with gorgeous costumes and this decade\'s best cinematic hats (and wigs).Yet you cannot shake a feeling of ""that\'s it?"" considering the material\'s potential";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

And return of Han Solo unfortunately he died Which was a shock when I watched it at the Cinema but overall great film With a great plot with the 1st Order and the Resistance I really liked Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. With his awesome mask and he was a different kind of character that you don't tend to see in Star wars at the end I thought the bit with Luke Skywalker and was a let down as I hoped to see more of Luke but it was a very good film to watch."", ""30 years have passed since the events of episode 6 (beware spoilers ahead), but this film spends virtually zero time establishing the background to what has happened before, and from the very get go of one mindless explosion to another, this is an action packed let- down, with very shallow character development, re-hashed action sequences stolen from episodes 5&6 (father-son confrontations/death star finale), poor comedy timings and poorer dialogue (Finn asking Ray if she has a boyfriend), and really awkward character introductions, such as that first superficial meeting between old flames Leia and Han - really? And what about the new death star: bigger, badder, but in fact much much tamer and stupider, with the very same weak spots as the old death star, which makes you wonder if human evolution in 30 years (where the dark side is concerned), is in genetic reverse. Like most of the film, soft spots like this just felt like generic, copied from, and dumbed down fan service without much thinking in way of originality, substance, and credibility, which is what real fans of Star Wars and fans of good films in general wanted for this incarnation.However, there are a few pluses here, since this film is still miles better than episode 1-3, and where roles are concerned, the strong female lead in Ray, and the prominent African American male lead in Finn, are commendable. There is still lots of room for improvement here, to prevent these characters from becoming merely token gestures in later episodes. Otherwise from a technical viewpoint, the one other major positive is the special effects. The use of actual effects in animatronics and physical set-pieces are the one aspect that set this film apart from most blockbusters nowadays, and here they are resoundingly successful in their use. Even the virtual effects (CGI), are used sparingly, and meld fluidly into the scene without distracting from the visual prowess. Yet more food for thought, despite this, it just goes to show how amazingly good the previous star wars films episode 4-6 looked, that the visual differences between them and this film are very minuscule.So to sum up, this is another franchise film in a long line of cash-in follow-ups that are mostly style over substance, and you'll need to suspend a lot of quality control to really like this one, but it also goes to show that you know a film is not doing the right things when its trailer made a better movie than its full incarnation. Thus in conclusion, the force is NOT so strong with this one, and only deserving of a fantastically superficial 5/10."", 'This movie is amazing, entertaining, and well crafted as a film in generalThe film is incredibly exciting with humor, action, references and a beautifully written plot.

SPOILERS FOLLOW !!!! !!!! SPOILERS FOLLOW !!!!But now, the bad\x85The problem is that it feels ""just a bit too much"" like home. If we only consider the ""real"" SW trilogy ( episodes IV thru VI), and ignore Lucas\' foray into unnecessary special effects craziness (episodes I thru III), then we\'ve now endured three out of four films (counting this new one) where the ""empire"" has constructed planet killing technology, and ""the rebels"" spend the last third of the film concocting an elaborate scheme to discover, and then exploit (with a ""desperate, down to the wire"" effort) the ""design mistakes"" of the empire, in order to ""blow up the planet killer"", and ""save the day"".But for episode VII, it\'s actually far worse than just that. You pretty much feel like someone took the script from episode IV, and did ""search and replace"" changes in a Word Processor, i.e. the script for VII is pretty much just a ""treatment"" on the IV script:Crash landing on a desert planet at the beginning: ""check"" As yet, unknown, future hero living on that same desert planet: ""check"" (but we\'ll do a gender change on the ""future hero"")";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The movie is so much better than I thought it would be (and that was bad) - I expected the comedy to be slapstick/junior/potty but it wasn't. The story was also good enough to keep my kids focused glued to the screen. The animation is wonderful. Music is tasteful. I can't imagine anyone but Jack Black pulling off the voice though - he definitely made the movie for me. The only thing distracted me was that most of the movie I spent trying to figure out who was doing the voice of Tai Lung (Ian McShane). As mentioned previously in the forums about the pop culture references in this movie - I don't remember one - very nice indeed - it works with some of the other movies but I can do without. This is the first movie in a while I'd like to see again."", ""Take it from me, this movie is brilliant. Don't go by it's silly child-pandering name, this film is for everybody. From little kids just looking for some simple fun for a little while to adults looking for a more compelling experience that makes you feel for the characters, this one's for everyone. Funny action adventure with some wise words scattered throughout."", ""I really wasn't expecting much, other than a few laughs, which would have been OK for a Dreamworks animation movie. But KUNG FU PANDA exceeded all expectations. The story is simple but the execution is superb. It would be really difficult to find something to improve on the production. The voice-overs are really good, esp Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. The animation is very rich and the colors are crisp and bright. The action sequences are breath-taking. The laughs are mixed in at the appropriate moments. The theater was full and it was composed of a mixture of Adults and young kids. This is a fun for all movie. A testament to this fact is that almost the whole crowd stayed for the end credits. This is a very rare occurrence nowadays.\\Oh.. and I hope this does not count as a spoiler. I absolutely loved the Samurai-Jack type animation for some scenes."", 'One of the best comedy movies I\'ve seen, this animation feature is both packed with action and intelligent at the same time. It\'s yet another variation on ""You can do anything if you believe in yourself"" and carries strong morale and educational message. But the way it\'s done, the incredible visual side of the story, as well as the dialogs, is just exceptional. You can\'t but love the fat Panda boy who\'s dreaming about being the greatest warrior of all China only to wake up to the reality of hawing to serve noodle soup in his father\'s shop. Unlike his father, who also dreamed but never found the courage to act on it, Panda follows his calling and by ""luck"" get chosen to be the legendary Dragon warrior by the Kung-Fu grand master, the old turtle, to defeat the evil tiger. That\'s when his training and troubles start. It\'s really for anyone between 3 and 100 and I laughed and loved it from the titles in the beginning to the very end. Much recommended.', 'Cartoons are typically targeted towards the younger audience. The impressionable minds, the sponges. So instead of making a movie which teaches that hard work, sustained commitment, discipline and patience ultimately pays off, here, we have the exact opposite. The team who has spent a lifetime preparing for a task is pushed aside in favor of a wholly unmotivated, ill-prepared, unqualified on all accounts ""hero"", who is chosen by destiny (which fairy tale could do without it ?) and conveyed through a turtle, who is about to kick the bucket himself.In matter of two days, a panda who is so overweight that he literally cannot get up, and could (or should) keel over from a massive stroke or a heart-attack any minute, is sharpened into a Master Kung-Fu fighter through a program of --consuming chicken dumplings.It\'s a frightening message for the younger generation: That unqualified and unprepared triumphs over the qualified and prepared, by goofing off. Panda has no inherent special powers in him. No gifts are bestowed upon him to make him special. He just becomes special because he believes he\'s special. Wow.I will say that there is nothing visually wrong in the way this movie is put together. The animation, direction and voice overs are all first-rate. My beef is with the central premise of the movie, which is why, I feel, kids should not be exposed to it.', ""'Kung Fu Panda' is another delightfully entertaining flick to come out this summer. Osbourne and Stevenson do a fine job in directing. What I really liked about the film is the sincere effort behind it and its lack of pretension and use of clichés. The directors stay focused on the main story which is Po's struggle. I could really relate to Po's dream and love for Kung Fu and his disappointment and lack of faith in failing to be successful in doing what he loves. The stellar voice cast that includes names like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Randall Duk Kim is impressive but it is Jack Black's show all the way, followed by Dustin Hoffman. Black's comic timing is wonderful as he provides some of the very memorable laugh-out-loud moments and he brilliantly succeeds in making Po both endearing and funny. I would never have guessed that Hoffman was behind the voicing of Shifu. The actor does an excellent job. I wish Jackie Chan had more lines. The music and CGI are good enough. There's a lot of energy. It's colourful and very appealing to the eyes and it's funny as hell. What's not to love? In my opinion, 'Kung Fu Panda' is a winner with both adults and kids."", ""First I need to make it clear that since I was born and grew up in China, this review might be biased because there is so much more I appreciate from the movie, given my cultural background.There is a specific category in the Chinese literature history called Kung Fu fictions and it had spread among generations currently between 12 - 60 years old. Have to admit, this movie touched deeply on that, far more than any Jackie Chan or Jet Lee movies. Because it is animated, it leaves more rooms for imaginations.I am very satisfied with the movie, though I watched it with my American-born kids. It is still a typical Hollywood production, but somehow, it touched my Chinese heart.It is a simple story, yet deep. See it if you haven't already."", 'Dreamworks Animation has it very tough now a days, living forever in the shadow of Pixar. But it\'s been hard to feel sorry for them. In the seven years after the smash success of the movie ""Shrek"", they\'ve only managed to churn out one mediocre and simplistic animated film after the other, set apart only by their top celebrity voices, and laden with kids only humor and tired pop-culture jokes. They haven\'t been bad per say, but when the competition is the likes of Toy Story or Finding Nemo, you start to wish they\'d try a little harder. Now along comes Kung Fu Panda, easily the best CGI kids film the studio has come up with. It\'s nothing spectacular, but it\'s great fun, and probably the most fun a family can have together at the movies this summer...in a movie without trash cleaning robots.The trailers for this film did nothing for me, but the minute its exciting and hilarious 2D opening was done, I knew I was for in something good. The story is definitely not the movie\'s strong point. It tells the basic tale of Po, voiced by Jack Black, a young and very overweight Great Panda and son of a noodle salesman, who dreams of one day being a Kung Fu master and joining the ranks of his idols, The Furious Five (characters representing the five classic styles of Shaolin Kung-fu: a tiger, crane, monkey, mantis, and snake, voiced by Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen and Lucy Liu respectively). When a premonition warns of the escape of the evil kung fu master Tai-Lung (Ian McShane), former student of the stern sensei Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), it is decided that the sacred title of ""Dragon Warrior"" must be given to a brave soul in hopes of stopping him. That title unsurprisingly lands on Po. As you might expect, there is a lot of doubting, and worry, until Po learns about the ""hero within"" and...well you\'ve seen it all before. It\'s very bare bones, but it\'s acceptable enough when the movie\'s strengths work so well.The voices and animation are top notch thankfully. All the actors fit well with their characters (Black can do the hefty underdog routine in his sleep) and do a fine job without a hint of them phoning it in, with Hoffman and McShane as the real standout. Hoffman excels as the up tight wise man or teacher that all Kung Fu movies need, though the Furious Five have a disappointingly smaller role then it seems they should, but have some great moments as well. The animation is crisp and beautiful";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They seek he... Read all;"['I liked this movie and I think it\'s a fine addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has the distinct directorial style of Sam Raimi with some quirky camera choices, horror elements and quick montages. The fight scenes and magic are more creative than in previous films, such as the musical battle. The visual design of the universes are very distinct and feels like other worlds have really come to life. It was very exciting to explore other worlds and other versions of Dr. Strange. Scarlet Witch has a truly terrifying presence.While I enjoyed the movie overall, it did disappoint some expectations and could have been better. As my review title states, it\'s more like Wandavision 2 than Doctor Strange 2. I kept wondering, whose movie is it? Elizabeth Olsen steals the show as Wanda, a corrupted demonic figure who fits the ""slasher"" role in this film, but her characterisation was also a bit too single-minded to feel like a real person.The pacing is very strange. It often skips about from one scene to another before they have really been explored or digested, leaving us with only a glimpse. This film feels like the characters are abruptly jumping between several films that have been awkwardly smashed together, unlike the first Doctor Strange film which was extremely focused. Cool scenes like the Illuminati were wasted by being disposed of so quickly. The multiverse isn\'t really explored beyond red and green being swapped and pizza balls being ""free"".The writing leaves a lot to be desired. As mentioned, this is essentially Wanda\'s story so nobody else is given much to work with. America Chavez is just there to run away from things, Christine Palmer is just there to give Dr. Strange something to anguish over and Wong is just there for the special effects. There are glimmers of character development but it goes nowhere. We keep seeing that Dr. Strange and Christine Palmer don\'t work out in any universe, which we already knew, but they keep repeating it for some reason, and it\'s not a compelling character relationship. Dr. Strange realises that he\'s really no different from the other versions of him, so he has to accept what he\'s got in this universe and not pine for things that are out of reach (i.e. Finding happiness without Christine). But he also realises that he can choose to be different from the other versions of him and work for the greater good without throwing anyone under the bus (i.e. Letting America Chavez keep her powers). Which one is it? What does he learn from the other versions of him?On a finer level, the dialogue had lots of problems. It was often very cheesy, like the supposedly inspiring speech Dr. Strange gives to America Chavez near the end. It was also full of blunt exposition, like the encyclopedic infodumps about multiversal powers, the Darkhold, the Vishanti, the Illuminati, Thanos and so on. There are times when it felt like the writing room had an extensive Q&A session where they tried to cover every possible viewer doubt, concern or plot hole, but instead of weaving the details in naturally, they just made the characters parrot their explanations verbatim, which sounded contrived and awkward. For example, there was one scene where the film stops so that Wong can ask Wanda point-blank why she wants full multiversal powers instead of just staying in one universe with her family. This happens a lot during the film.The writer Michael Waldron was chosen because of his experience with multiverse stories, especially Loki. This sounds great until you realise that Waldron has already run out of ideas and just wrote the same story again:Main tension: The powerful protagonist is put in cuffs and deprived of his powers (Loki: Loki";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As far as I\'m concerned ""Predator"" = jungles and body butter. So I fully admit that I have limited context here. That said, this movie kicked butt. I cared way more about Naru and her brother (not to mention her dog) than I did about anybody in the original. I found the cinematagrophy breathtaking, I found the characters compelling, and I\'m kind of all in on seeing what happens when we transport modern franchises into different historical/cultural contexts. Plus, the callbacks were delightful. Nobody\'s going to give this movie an Oscar, but I\'d rather watch a story like this than most movies with capes and poorly staged action sequences. I was sucked in from moment one, and Amber Midthunder completely captivated me for the whole runtime. It\'s nice to know that movies like this can still surprise me, not to mention make me stand up and cheer.', ""-Great visuals and music\n-Very atmospheric feel...the wilderness feels like a character of its own which makes it the most immersive movie of the franchise\n-I could be very critical of the script and the fact that there are not much memorable characters/not much nuance but this is a predator movie not call me by your name 2 ...\n-Very satisfying action (some of my favourite in the series ) apart from one scene with bad cuts (Naru vs the other comanche guys)\n-Also good pacing and length..doesn't overstay its welcome and I'd watch a sequel... I recommend."", 'I didn\'t hate this movie but I thought the writing was very sloppy, considering the fantastic premise offered so much potential. Sorry if I start to ramble, but it really bugs me when I believe a film could have been greatly improved with a few tweaks of the script. So my problems are as follows (please hear me out - and excuse such a terribly long review, but I just can\'t help myself, lol):Why is Naru 150% convinced right from the first tiny hint at the predator that there\'s this HUUGE threat out there? As far as she knows, the predator hasn\'t hurt anyone except for a snake, and when Naru finds a weird footprint and sees the unnatural, purple lightning/light flashes just before she falls when the mountain lion attacks - how are those things indicative of a bigger threat than the metal trap her dog gets caught in at the beginning? And why does she even think the mysterious purple flashes and the footprint come from a creature of flesh and blood? The only thing she could possibly conceive of (remember: this is a Native American Girl from 300 years ago) is some forest spirit or even some kind of God that has come to these woods - certainly not a creature that any normal Native American would ever intend to hunt (on the contrary, such a creature would more likely be respected or even worshiped).What I\'m trying to say is: the predator at this point hasn\'t done anything that would require any action from Naru (or anyone else), and it\'s only the audience who knows from previous movies that this creature is a threat - there\'s no way our heroine would logically deduct that from the evidence she has. The trap her dog got caught in at the beginning on the other hand IS a sign for a huge threat to the tribe, but she doesn\'t even think it\'s necessary to warn her people about it, let alone further investigate who/what put it there. I think the script does the character of Naru a huge disservice by making her look rather over-ambitious to prove herself instead of actually giving her a plausible reason for wanting to protect her village by going after the predator.If on the other hand the script had made the stakes more personal (and more primal), it would have worked to the character\'s and the story\'s advantage in my opinion. For example: imagine a scenario where they went after the lion, and her brother defeated it - then out of nowhere comes this monster and kills her brother and Naru\'s the only one who saw it and nobody believes her - then she\'d have a believable motivation to go after it. But strange lights and a footprint? Really? That doesn\'t seem in line with anything we know about Native Americans from that period - it\'s just the script that insists this makes sense.And Naru\'s actions towards the bear are another good example of the writing not doing a very good job at showing her as either a skilled hunter or someone who ""only wants to protect her people from a threat"". Naru is portrayed as this child of nature that knows every plant and every animal track, so when she hears a bear, we must assume she knows it\'s a bear - yet she goes straight towards it. Why? The bear\'s not a threat towards anyone, and we learn it\'s peacefully eating its meal - a scene that shouldn\'t come as a surprise to a Naru in any way.But she observes it as if she were witnessing something exceptional or new to her. And does she quickly retreat when the bear gets her scent? No, she tries to shoot at it with a bow and arrow! Why would she do that? Is that the action of an intelligent hunter or someone who wants to protect her people? And when that (literally) backfires and gives her position away, and she only gets saved by the dog distracting the bear, she even runs after this gigantic grizzly and tries again to shoot at it with her bow and arrow (and don\'t tell me she tries to save her dog, because that dog is perfectly able to outrun the bear, as is made very obvious in that scene). The script makes her behave in a way no Native American ever would, and I think the writers should have tried a little harder to portray that culture in a more realistic (and thus more respectful) way.Because here again Naru comes mainly across as someone who\'s over-eager to prove herself in a one-on-one combat with a dangerous adversary. Her actions seem inept and reckless, and the script makes that even worse since the young men sent out by Naru\'s brother to rescue her all get killed.And here comes another thing that irked me: all the young Native Americans except for Naru\'s brother are shown as these angry, violent brutes who even beat Naru up. I\'m not an expert on Native American cultures but this did strike me as kinda extreme, and it also bothered me in terms of the storytelling. Naru\'s brother obviously loves her and cares deeply about her, and the other young men who respect him and followed his order to ""rescue"" her must know that. Would they really behave in such a brutal, violent way towards the beloved sister of the guy who sent them to rescue her?And I think all these issues could have easily been fixed: If Naru\'s brother had been killed by the predator after the lion hunt, and If the other young men in her tribe had thought he had been killed by either another lion or a bear and decided to hunt that beast refusing to take the girl along whose story about the ""monster"" they didn\'t believe, our heroine would have had a more sympathetic reason to go after that hunting party: both to save them AND to avenge her brother by killing the monster. Instead, the script almost makes it look like she\'s partly responsible HER rescue party gets killed, because she blindly follows her ambition.Another huge issue: what\'s up with the Frenchies? They discover a helpless Native American girl in a trap and decide: she MUST KNOW something";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Awkwafina is hilarious and I wish she had more screen time.

Great cinematics and CGI. Can't wait to see what the Marvel team delivers next. Perfectly executed!"", ""I am not a big fan of the many, many Marvel films. The only reason I saw this one was that my oldest daughter insisted I watch it....and overall I was impressed by the movie, though I think it was enjoyable more for the insane eye candy than the story itself.I could talk about the plot but just noticed that there are over 2000 reviews for this film. So, I'll just say that it looked great and would have been great to have seen it on the big screen. The story itself, though enjoyable, wasn't one that particularly grabbed me or impacted on me...possibly because it was so violent and frenetic that the film, as a consequence, lacked intimacy and humanity."", 'Finally! A fun and entertaining movie without all the garbage Hollyweird offers. Great special effects and story line. Best movie I have seen since the Covid outbreak.', ""Truly an amazing movie! This movie depicts family very well. The visual effects are stunning, the martial arts are incredible, and there is just enough humor in it to relieve some of the darker notes. I can't wait for the sequel!"", ""Destin Daniel Cretton's 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography, but the film misses a solid storyline for an origin story as its titular character lacks personality and does not go through any heroic transformation story arc. Simu Liu has a strong presence as Shang-Chi, yet he is overshadowed by many of his more experienced co-stars."", ""Shang-Chi is one of Marvel Comic's most unknown and underutilized characters in their comics, with his original comics containing a decent amount of racist imagery and embarrassing caricatures of various Asian stereotypes. At it's best, the MCU can turn any obscure group or concept from the comics into gold, and Shang-Chi is no different.Shang-Chi might be one of the best examples of an idea that's actually better on film than the original source material, with the character's relationships, motivations, and place in the overall Marvel Universe all being improved upon in the film adaptation as opposed to the comics where he's mainly a hand-to-hand expert with no powers or special weapons, and isn't generally of much value to The Avengers.Simu Liu is charismatic and athletically gifted enough to do solid justice to the lead role. I hope the sequel gives him even more to do with his character and his legacy, but for an introduction, this was great. Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh, and of course the legendary Tony Leung all lend their talents to a great cast of characters.Wen Wu is easily one of the top villain/antagonist characters in the MCU and probably all of comic book films. He's intimidating and masterful as a ruler, but heartfelt and believable as a family man. His presence elevates the entire production as he's a legend of cinema.There's moments reminiscent of Black Panther, and the third act gets heavy into Chinese mythological imagery, but understand that this is not only meant as a superhero movie, but also a love-letter to Chinese storytelling and culture.Shang-Chi features some of the best physical/non-super powered fight scenes in the MCU, with the choreography and the cinematography of said action taking a higher level. As soon as I saw the bus fight scene in the opening I had no worries about this part of the movie.The Ten Rings themselves are not a weapon used in the comics, and are a wonderfully creative, versatile, and visually stunning weapon unlike anything I've ever seen before, and that's not an easy thing to say having seen as much comic book and sci-fi material as me.Some of the pacing and character development could be a little better, but overall Shang-Chi is on the higher end of Marvel movies, and can also be solidly enjoyed by audiences totally unfamiliar with Marvel in general."", ""This movie is really good! In fact the first half of the movie is almost flawless. Incredible combat scenes and a great family drama story set-up which promises an emotional climax and confrontation.SPOILERS:Where the movie fails to become a masterpiece is the last 20 minutes. Throughout the whole movie the conflict between father and son is at the forefront and is the real emotional driving force of the story. And what a great idea for a superhero movie to tackle such a deep and relatable topic.There is even an important line of foreshadowing by Shang, the evening before the final battle: -I'm going to kill my father-. What a strong statement and what a setup.But then the climax of the movie turns out the be a fight between 2 dragons.. the father dies by pure bad luck couple of scenes earlier.. killed by a random monster.A HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITYIf they had kept the emotional conflict and the father&son dynamic as the climax of the movie, it COULD have become a masterpiece, which would have been more then just a great super-hero movie, it would have become timeless.HERE'S MY PITCH FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES:1) the father tries to open the gate.

The tensed family relationship was a great focus as the father's gravity and charisma almost matched that of Thanos and feels like a truly deep human being. Throughout, the fight choreography was amazing, especially the bus scene.The second half was an obligatory CGI mess that takes the focus away from the family relationship. The epic legendary city of Ta Lo (Chinese version of Wakanda) is about thirty people living in a wooden village. That's all that stands between the world and a world-destroying demon, apparently. The hyped up final battle involves about ten soldiers with tasers. Wasn't the Ten Rings supposed to be a world-spanning empire? The fight between the dragons was so fast-paced that I couldn't tell what was going on.That said, there are flaws that occur in both of the halves. The Ten Rings (the organisation) is very vague in its nature and impact. Why are they so feared? How have they taken over the world? What are they capable of? Show, don't tell! The Ten Rings (the artifacts) don't seem to do much beyond flying around and projecting energy.

And in fact it was something like it in that he with the rings had the power. Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) had the ten rings which gave him near omnipotence. With the ten rings he could defeat entire armies and live forever. He decided to use the rings to become a tyrant.He was willing to put his rings aside and grow old for the love of his life, a woman he found after living 1000 years. I thought it was a bit strange that it took the man 1000 years to find his true love, but I didn\'t dwell on it.Stranger than him taking a thousand years to find his true love was the woman who fell in love with him. She lived in a secret magical village in Macao that was totally isolated from the rest of the world. She was a gentle benign character who had powers herself and was able to defeat Wenwu when he came to essentially conquer her village. Somehow, through their Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-esque battle they fell in love. Maybe that makes sense for him being that he finally found someone who could defeat him, but it didn\'t make sense for this nearly pure woman to fall for a man with a 1000 year history of tyranny.Still, they wed, forsook their powers and started a family.Their family would be unceremoniously destroyed when an old foe of Wenwu--a vicious gang--came by their house to get their pound of flesh and killed Wenwu\'s wife, Li (Fala Chen). Li could\'ve attempted to barter with them for some sort of material exchange for their past losses, but instead she immediately decided she\'d try to fight the entire gang and lost her life in the process. That would cause Wenwu to don the ten rings again and return to tyranny.So, if you\'re keeping score on Wenwu\'s wife, 1.) she was smitten with a man who came to destroy her village and 2.) she chose to fight an entire gang with no powers to speak of and with no attempts to negotiate.I recognize that it was a plot device to advance the plot, but it could\'ve been done a lot better and with more tact. Her character never struck me as someone impulsive and/or not able to judge character yet she exhibited both flaws.Most of what I\'ve covered was garnered throughout the movie via flashbacks. The real main character was Saun aka Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). He was the son of Wenwu and Li. Years later we see an adult Saun. He lives in SF and is a valet. He is violently thrust back into the life he ran away from when his father\'s goons came for the pendant around his neck given to him by his mother. It was at this point we learned his backstory, of which I\'ve given some already. We find out he also has a sister, Xialing (Meng\'er Zhang), who Disney not so subtly informed us she had to train herself to become a fierce warrior because of her gender. The two of them had been split up for close to twenty years when Saun ran away after being trained to be an assassin by his father. He was fourteen at the time and she was ten when he promised her he\'d be back. He never came back and when they met again in Macao as adults she held the same ten-year-old bitterness against him for running away as though a fourteen-year-old should\'ve been more reliable. She greeted him with a butt-kicking that was twenty years in the making. It\'s clear that it never crossed her mind that he may have been killed, or maybe she would\'ve considered his death a betrayal as well. Either way it was a completely childish way to handle reuniting with your long lost brother.The two of them would join forces along with Saun\'s friend Katy (Awkwafina) and really quickly to stop their father. He was going to use the ten rings to breach a portal to another dimension which contained some soul-sucking demons.The introduction of demons to the movie did offer some excitement. It upped the stakes of everyone involved and thrust another Marvel character into the role of saving the world.Saun would save the world with the help of his friends and family. Some would die, but the most important characters lived. I was somewhat satisfied with the movie. The acting was commendable and Awkwafina was good as the comic relief. ""Shang-Chi"" may just be the placement of a singular brick to build to something bigger, I just hope what Marvel is building towards is worth it.', ""This was just a lot of fun. The story wasn't as tight as it could have been, but I found myself enjoying the whole movie regardless. The fight choreography was bangin', and all the action was just very well directed. Everything felt purposeful and exhilarating. The beginning of the movie feels like a straight-up martial arts movie and then as it progresses we get more and more fantasy elements working their way in which felt like a nice contrast. The music definitely felt like it added a lot here. I kept being reminded of how mixing different elements in with the more traditional orchestrated sounds really worked for Black Panther's soundtrack, and I honestly think this film did it even better. I think that, all in all, this is probably the best thing Marvel has produced since Endgame."", ""It was an okay movie. Simu Liu is the son of the seemingly immortal master of the Ten Rings --always good to see Tony Leung, and I hope he soaked Disney --who winds up opposing his dad, and Awkwafina is his slacker sort-of girlfriend. They are fine in the leads, as is Meng'er Zhang as his sister, and Michelle Yeoh as their aunt -- always good to see her, and I hope she soaked Disney too.I have grown increasingly fond of martial arts films over the last couple of decades, and the decline of the movie musical is the reason why. They don't make movies like that any more, and when they try, they're often embarrassing. People don't like the unreality of people bursting out into song, or expressing their emotions through dance. No, they prefer the solid commonplace of people floating through space to kick each other in the head. To me, the fight choreography is its own dance, and the fight between Leung and Fala Chen when they meet and before they fall in love is a challenge dance as graceful as any between Astaire and Rogers.There are problems aplenty with this film. There's an immense amount of exposition, starting off with twenty minutes of it in Chinese. I'm not sure why Ben Kingsley as the fake 'Mandarin' from IRON MAN 3 is present except for a certain remnant of star power and connecting this to the rest of the MCU. Still, with my expectations not set particularly high, I had a good time."", 'This film us well written and directed. All the action sequences are well choreographed. This is an origin story but it will not give you marvel movie vibe(in a positive way) until and unless you will see the post credit scenes. Yes, there are 2 credit scenes. Simu liu and Tony was the highlight of the movie, Awkwafina has also performed well. Her chemistry with Simu was extraordinary and her comic timing was also perfect.', ""I really liked that the actors spoke their native language, Mandarin, because it would've felt too Americanized otherwise. But there was something unfinished about this movie and I'm not sure what it is. The pacing was alright, a little too slow or fast at times, and as far as storylines go, it was not as exciting as I thought it would be. The fight scenes were great though, especially the final grand battle scene."", 'This was fantastic. Saw it in theaters then again as soon as it was out on streaming too!

I don't know about you, but when the villains are portrayed as sadistic psychopaths with no real motive or character, I lose interest in the story.tl";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The story is honestly a bit of a mess (we have two villains, one of which is only there to set up the inevitable sequel, the other only elevated by Ice Cube\'s entertaining performance and a creepy character design) and the dialogue is so packed with pop culture references that it became tiresome.As a TMNT outing, the film\'s biggest flaw is how the turtles all sound the same. The core of the everlasting appeal of the TMNT franchise is the give and take between the four brothers: Leonardo is serious due to his high expectations for himself, Raphael is a hothead with anger issues, Michelangelo loves partying to the detriment of his concentration, and Donatello is a geek who ""does machines,"" to quote the \'87 theme song. The best TMNT outings play up these differences, creating both tension and affection among the turtles. Here, these traits are downplayed so all the turtles can be loud, pop culture-spewing kids with ADHD. A lot of people have praised how they feel like ""real teens,"" and yes, some teens are like this, but it ignores that teenagers are not one size fits all in terms of personality.A few good things: while I prefer my Splinters to be wise and mature, Jackie Chan\'s paranoid Splinter cracked me up consistently. I also liked this new April more than I expected to. I prefer April to be an older sister figure to the turtles as she was in the 1987 and 2003 shows, and in the classic 1990 film. Lately, there seems to be more of a push to have April as a teenage friend/love interest, which I don\'t often like. I thought that was done well here though and I thought her chemistry with the turtles was excellent, their budding friendship very natural.The group I went with (which included some massive TMNT fans) enjoyed the movie, but I just expect more out of family films these days. With PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH and the SPIDERVERSE films, we deserve family animation with more heart and originality than the likes of MUTANT MAYHEM or THE SUPER MARIO BROS MOVIE, both very attractive films with little else to offer. I still say the 1990 TMNT movie is the definitive big screen take: it had humor, great character dynamics, a gritty NYC aesthetic, and a tense finale. It\'s a great film that takes itself seriously, even when the filmmakers could have phoned it in and still gotten a hefty payday from box office receipts. I really wish the newer TMNT films would do likewise.', '""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem"" is the new film based on the acclaimed cartoon that aired from the late \'80s to the mid-\'90s, both animated and live action film adaptations had previously been made, this new film stands out with its computer animation mixed with some scenes based on the look of a comic, in addition to the excellent use of shadows and colors. The script is common telling the story of people trying to fit in and family relationships, all from a mutant perspective. The soundtrack is good, having an eighties style in some of its compositions. A well-made film, with an unoriginal script but wonderful animation.', ""Good evening,I don't usually leave reviews but I felt impelled to after seeing this film.I'm a big turtles fan, I was a kid during turtlemania. Team Mikey personally. However, where The TV series seem to be able to do it the films just don't.But this one, sigh...this one looked like it might just be amazing. 'Written by fans' always fills me with hope, and it's by no means an awful film, but there are too many bits that grated.In no particular order:The turtle brothers' personalities aren't as clearly defined in this version, in my opinion. To be fair I thought Leo was pretty well done, a bit more mature than the others, level headed. And Raph, hot head, fists firsts, decent. Mike and D though...Donatello liked anime...Mikey liked improv......I thought this aspect of the writing was lazy, especially since the characters were already written for them!!Splinter...Not Japanese, not a ninja master (or the pet rat of a ninja master)...seemingly a Chinese rat who taught the turtles ninja skills off of YouTube or summat! I get it, it's a tongue in cheek version of summat that itself was a tongue in cheek version of something else. But still...being a ninja is more than just the fighting, and personally I prefer the wisdom of the usual Splinter. Just another change that doesn't need to exist...in some ways it's a distraction in the story that needs explaining.Bebop and Rocksteady are friendly mutants...I'll just leave that there...There was other stuff, but for me these are basics. Turtles already has a solid foundation, just a bit more imagination and they could've been put in a great story,,,and dare I say a bit more effort and it could've been a better script, not as funny or clever as I'd hoped it would be.Good bits...thought it was cast well, particularly the turtles. Good camaraderie. Paul Rudd always delivers.The animation was fantastic. I'm a bit of an animation nerd and this was right up my street. Shout out to spiderverse too which is an example of some groundbreaking animation but spiderverse also nailed it on story and character and everything really.The fight scene against the baddies who stole April's bike was brilliant, in fact a lot of the action scenes were pretty great, there just weren't enough of them.Now...I've been quite dour about it...and like I say, it's OK, just not good enough in my opinion. However, I got straight on the internet when I got home to check if there was a sequel and apparently there is. There'll be a TV series which acts as a bridge between this film and the sequel. So, without the benefit of future hindsight or present foresight, there's a chance all this can be saved, maybe this film is just a warm-up to some fantastic ideas down the road. Maybe the turtles have little to no recognisable personality because why would they having grown up alone together...maybe when they go through the TV show, where apparently they go their own separate ways (a change I'm open to, along with the fact they're in high school, as long as it's done well), they become more like their older versions...maybe Donatello does machines later on, as well as watching anime...who knows...so I live in perpetual hope that someone somewhere nails a TMNT film...apparently some of the guys involved in Turtles TV series 2012 are involved in this later stuff and I thought that TV series was brilliant...In the meantime I should write my own eh, and stop whining about a kids' film in my late 30s......Peace."", ""NO SPOILERS: this movie was everything I wanted it to be, it was a perfect stunning reboot with almost every tmnt mutant.I was never really a tmnt fan, but this movie made me one. Another awesome thing about this movie, is that the turtles are actual casted teenagers.I wasn't interested when I heard it was a Seth Rogan movie, but as soon as I saw the sneak peak trailer I was hyped, especially when Jackie Chan was splinter.When I find out about some of the cast I didn't like it, for example ice cube as superfly or post mallone as ray fillet just didn't sound like a good idea, but it worked, and was funny."", ""I'm not a hard-core 80s turtles fan but I grew up with the 03 animated series and lived through the Michael Bay reboots. Gotta say, I miss Michael a little bit.The idea of this movie on paper was great. TMNT but animated with love and care like Into the Spiderverse. But that in itself was not enough to save this movie. The writing was atroctius and just unbelievable. I didn't understand half the dialouge that came out of the turtles mouths. And the completely unneeded amount of characters that served no purpose other than having cool looking mutants hanging around. A fun watch and that's it for me."", 'I was actually looking forward to this, the ratings were good and kids were excited to see it. The animation is very dark, reminds me of Sin City. The ""humour"" fell flat, something about milking turtles was repeated ad nauseam, so it was obviously thought this would be a funny joke throughout. Splinter is an old fat dad figure who eventually fights but not likeable at all. Bebop and rock steady end up good?!! So yeah, overall my wife and I both hated the film. My 11 year old and 9 year old both thought it was OK but I just feel it wasn\'t a very happy child friendly film. So in summary: too dark, not funny, and won\'t be watching the second one!', ""Prior to showering it with compliments, I'd like to address a couple of minor criticisms. To begin with, Splinter underwent significant changes from the familiar and beloved character. Certain villains were left with insufficient screen time to truly shine, and Raphael's anger wasn't adequately explored.Moving on to the positives: The animation boasted exceptional uniqueness, accompanied by superb pacing. The humor was genuinely delightful, and the turtles authentically conveyed their teenage nature through their dialogue. The voice acting was skillfully executed, capturing both the tone and essence of teenage voices. Particularly notable was Jackie Chan's portrayal of Master Splinter, which stood out significantly. Overall, this movie provides a highly enjoyable viewing experience."", ""Very mixed bag for me...a lot to like and a lot to dislike. I loved the look of the thing, but was so keenly aware of the debt it owed to the Spider-verse films for its aesthetic that I couldn't help but be taken out of the film quite a lot on that basis alone. I love the look of these movies, but I'm dreading the day when animation trends so hard that way that we see nothing else and we have to wait another twenty years until somebody else lands on an innovation popular enough to send the whole industry in a new direction again.I liked the personalities of the turtles and am totally on board with the turn to making them actual teenagers.A lot of the humor worked for me, but (as with Barbie) a lot really didn't.I was trepidatious about the new take on Splinter, but they won me over with that almost immediately, which makes sense given my utter devotion to Jackie Chan.I did not like their take on April at all. She was a statement...not a character.The plotting was very weak. The decision to have all the mutants turn on Superfly was not earned at all. They also failed to really establish any set of criteria whatsoever for why we ought to think the Turtles were right and Superfly was wrong...going so far as to acknowledge that Splinter basically thought the exact same way. It's lazy writing that procures this kind of result.Overall, an enjoyable experience, but fraught with issues."", ""As a lifelong fan of the franchise, who collected literally everything ever made including all the toys, the original black and whites that got them known, the cartoon series...this is absolutely the worst adaptation ever made. Like what was Seth thinking??? I had to walk out on it. Just wow. Like what kind of drugs were the people who made this movie on? Those must be those next level drugs. Those Star Wars type drugs. Those Marvel drugs. Indiana Jones type drugs. Splinter was horrible and goofy, the turtles are morons. I looked forward to some of the real voice actors for the enemy mutants, but the goofy gimmicky animation concept for this movie ruins it for me. Turtles weren't covered in ooze in this one. It was urine."", ""The movie was, overall, pretty fun to watch. The characters were interesting and unique, the story was pretty good, and the action and animation with the unique art style really made it stand out. However, the major themes of fear, hatred and acceptance are swept under the rug for a lot of jokes that didn't entirely land and a lot of lingo and references to cater more to kids and teens. Which isn't a bad thing, but it was laid on really thick and made it where the movie was trying too hard to seem cool at times. It hurt the movie even more when the characterizations of the villains were more played for laughs than anything else, especially with the main one. The change of making the turtles act and sound like actual teens was a perfect change, but we didn't see enough of the ninja in the mix. A really good start, but if more of these are gonna be made, they've got to balance it out more with the jokes, characters, drama and action or it's gonna start losing people."", ""What an entertaining wild ride this movie is! The animation rivals anything that Pixar or any other studio puts out with being very original and stylistic. The casting is picture perfect as well for example Jackie Chan as Master Splinter was awesome! The soundtrack is also top notch. What I really enjoyed about this entry in the Ninja Turtle universe is they actually made the Turtles teenagers which is how it should have always been. I found myself laughing alot throughout the film as there are many funny/enjoyable moments for the duration of the movie. If you are looking for a good time or are a fan of the Ninja Turtles then you don't want to miss this. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem gets 8 huge stare ou of 10 from me. Bring on the sequel!"", ""I grew up with the turtles but of all of the films that went to the cinema, I would put this 5th on the list of the 7, just above secret of the ooze and turtles in time. I expected more from Seth Rogen, it was slightly boring and any wit in it was in the trailer. I thought it would have hidden adult jokes - hardly any if at all. The animation was good at first, became distracting and it was dark all of the time. The story was slow and the action was few and far between. The turtles personalities were a lot less rounded and individual than any other incarnations. It just felt forced and not as fun as ones that had come before. It wasn't bad but if I was watching it at home I would have probably turned it over.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Honestly in my opinion Return of the Jedi is far way better film than The Force Awakens, that movie was a disaster and it sucked, I rather watch this movie any time. It is not my favorite film in the series and I don\'t love this movie that much like I love the first two movies, but I like it and it think it is very good at some points. The film has a lot of problems, that hurts the movie. I still have enjoyed this movie and I had a lot of fun. Return of the Jedi (1983) is directed this time from Richard Marquand a different director than it was directed from Irvin Kershner and George Lucas. This movie was released on the same year that I was born in 1983. The film is pretty good on it is own way, but on the other thing it suffers from problems and flaws.Things I like in this movie: The first hour is set back on planet Tatooine which is a rescue mission which I like, the story is set where the first movie begins and ends here.Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO, and R2-D2 return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (who was encased in carbonite at the end of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) from the gangster Jabba the Hutt (voice: Larry Ward).A battle on ship, with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba\'s men. During the battle, Leia strangles Jabba to death with the chain around her neck and with R2-D2\'s help escapes from her bonds. The heroes destroy the ship, kills the bad guys and save Han solo. I love the explosion, the rescue and than they are all save.I love that we find out from ghost of Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that Leia (Carrie Fisher) is the sister of Luke ( Mark Hamill). I love that Luke revels to Leia that she is his sister.I like the battle on the Endor, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Ewoks are battling Stormtroopers to destroying the shield generator for the second Death Star and they do the destroy it. Lando and his assault team destroys the deaths tar on the end.Luke face Darth Vader and the evil Emperor and fights both of them, while they where both trying to bring him on a dark side of the force to join them.I love when Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side, Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle, slicing off Vader\'s right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut, and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son\'s blade.Realizing that Luke cannot be turned, the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him, Vader repents and turns on the Emperor, throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death.Luke try\'s to save Anakin but he dies before he could save him.I feel that Luke\'s transition from a teenager to calm and collected warrior of the Force feels very authentic. His conflict between Darth Vader and the Emperor contains some of the best scenes in the entire saga.Things I don\'t like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it: This movie\'s biggest flaw is the pacing, the Ewoks and their role in the film. Star Wars been in a forest, aren\'t Star Wars suppose to set in the Galaxy and not in the forest? Personally I don\'t mind the Ewoks, but their introduction causes the movie comes to a screeching halt. Another fault of this movie is its attempts at humor. It feels often unnatural and forced a lot of the time. The Phantom Menace has been notorious for having this problem as well, but they most likely originated here.Master Yoda dies in this film! Why? Watching Yoda in the prequels I have really enjoyed him much more than I have watching him in the last two movies. Little guy grove up in to my heart. So I disagree about him dying.I am giving this movie an 8, I watch A New Hope and Retun of the Jedi on TV as a kid I don\'t remember watching The Empire Strikes Back, but I have saw those tow movies and still I like Return of the Jedi a lot.', ""I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but that this one isn't even in the TOP 100.This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie:-The Rescue of Han Solo from Jabba: This official wraps up the Han Solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in A NEW HOPE.-The Emperor was Finally Revealled: Well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw The Emperor as kids.-The Speeder Bike Chase: Alright, so this was a special effects moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!-The 3 Part Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (Led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke Confronts his Father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Death Star (Lando's Moment)-The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: Like I said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the Ewoks but I think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other.All in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the STAR WARS story."", ""This movie might not be as flawless as the first two but everything involved with those throne room scenes were some of the highest points in the entire saga, the conflict between luke and vader, the emperor himself finally showing up for the first time and he's so good at being this manipulative evil, the final lightsaber battle is just breathtaking with that amazing music by john williams and the beautiful ending of the film that brings everything together, those moments alone makes this one of the most underrated in the whole franchise and in my opinion it's the second best movie behind the empire strikes back."", ""Totally should've won at least some of the awards it was nominated for! A very different adventure story with lots of adorable characters, more truths and the epic Emperor Palpatine! I love all the majestic forest aspects. Still crazy to me that they filmed so many parts especially the chases. The bulk of this art in cinema is done so well and always entertaining. Quite lovable many years later and not many movies have that kind of force!"", ""There's a reason why Anakin Skywalker/ Darth Vader is my favorite character of all time. Even after everything he did, he still fulfilled the prophecy and brought balance to the force. The scene where luke takes off his helmet makes me tear up all the time. Poetry.Not only that, but the story of Luke Skywalker is also told flawlessly. As with obi wan, he was never seduced by the dark side.Truly an amazing movie. Not as good as Empire, but outstanding nonetheless."", 'I like the bit when the ewoks crush an ATST with two logs on a rope', 'Legendary all-encompassing, complete a great final.star warsa not after starting 6 movies 60 movies you would watch, you never want to end this series in this series. .Because all of them are very friendly, cute and warmly created characters.But unfortunately we have to finish the series with the return of the jedi.As Luke enters into a war of will with his father and emperor, the rebels are struggling both in the woods and in space, especially the dialogues between the emperor Darth Vader and Luke are well written and immersive, and the Ewok are so sweet and especially fun to think of 3CPO as a god.', 'In many ways, Return of the Jedi cut firmly against the brilliant grain set by Empire Strikes Back. The reason Empire was so effective was that it showed us the rebels were still losing, you can\'t just destroy the Death Star and have everything go away. But here, Lucas rounds out the trilogy with another climactic space battle and everything wraps up really nicely with no questions ask. Return of the Jedi is clearly the least impressive of the original trilogy. It is full of holes, tonal inconsistencies and plot implausibilities. I\'d chalk this up to Richard Marquand not being half as competent as Irvin Kershner, and the departure of Gary Kurtz from the project. Kurtz reportedly left because he and Lucas couldn\'t agree on whether story or spectacle should take priority (Lucas was obviously in favour of spectacle), and you can tell because Return of the Jedi\'s story makes absolutely no sense in places.The opening sequences in Jabba\'s palace entertained me to no end as a child, but now it just confuses me. How long has it been since Empire Strikes Back? Didn\'t Lando and Chewie go in to try and rescue Han? Chewie and the droids are turned over to Jabba, but Leia seems ready to get Han out of there and leave them behind. Was it the plan to get captured? Was Luke\'s plan to get captured? Since when can Luke do Jedi mind tricks? Did Luke go back and train with Yoda for a year, and if so, why wasn\'t ""is Vader really my father"" not asked then? The film\'s screenplay is quite messy and doesn\'t flow on from the rest of the saga. In one typical scene, Yoda admonishes Luke for rushing off to face Vader without proper training, then says he doesn\'t need anymore training and only when he confronts Vader will he be a Jedi. Again, maybe some concrete evidence on how long has passed would help. This film is the point where the story meant little to Lucas and the details even less (Solo is promoted from Captain to General where all he did was get frozen in carbonite, and Calrissian walks off the street into the role of General!). I\'ve always regarded Darth Vader quite lowly on my list of movie villains, and watching Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back I found myself wondering why. I now realise its because Return of the Jedi completely nukes him. The idea of there still being good in Vader comes completely out of nowhere - he tortured his son with the knowledge that his father is the most evil man in the galaxy and then chopped his hand off and let him fall to his likely death. The addition of Emperor Palpatine also relegates Darth Vader to a side character - during the conversations between Luke and the Emperor, Vader sort of stands diffently to the side and chips in with the occasional ""yeah. what he said."" Palpatine\'s character development pretty much begins and ends with ""evil"" - he seems so sure that Luke will join him, yet Luke\'s battle with the dark side emerges only as a plot point in those scenes. Even if Luke turns to the dark side, what will make him join Palpatine? The expanded universe implies more information about this, but its not very well established here. The execution is pretty inconsistent - Luke goes from being Alec Guinness-style calm to flailing his lightsaber around like he\'s never held one before. Now that I mention it, Mark Hamill seems to be playing two characters simultaneously. I\'ve covered what I didn\'t like, but this is a Star Wars film and there\'s so much to love. The epic space battle at the second Death Star only reminds me how much I missed it in Empire Strikes Back. Ford is having a lot of fun in this movie, and the rest of the cast delivers pretty solidly as well. The gorgeously shot introduction of Red Guards in stark contrast with the white stormtroopers is a beautiful throwback to Vader\'s black/white contrast in the original Star Wars, and once again, it tells us the bars have been raised. The sound editing/mixing is always in good form in Star Wars - my favourite scene being a harsh lightsaber ignition sound just as Luke says Vader won\'t hurt him or turn him over to Palpatine. The Battle of Endor walks a narrow line between cheesy and genuinely exciting, and Marquand keeps the Ewoks just shy of the Gungans.Return of the Jedi is a really fun movie, but its not a cinematic artwork like its predecessors. I grew up watching this film, but when I read about where the story would have gone were it not for Lucas\' toy revenue - the death of Han Solo and a tired Luke walking into the distance like an old Western - I\'d be lying if I said the film\'s sickly sweet dance party ending didn\'t stick in my craw just a bit.', ""Return of the Jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series, and is a fine conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. With Han Solo imprisoned by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side, and only our favourite heroes can pull it off.The Opening sequence, set on Tatooine, we see Jabba's palace, a pit of slavery and scum, and new home to Han Solo, as Luke and the gang prepare for his rescue, and with Luke's Jedi powers, they have the edge.We also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end. Han, Leia and Chewy battle it out on Endor, desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the Death Star. The Rebel Fleet led by Lando, battle with the Imperial Fleet while they wait for the shields to go down, and Luke has a final showdown with Darth Vader. An Epic end to a Classic Saga, and it's only just off the pace of the first two.10/10"", ""The incredible ending to the story of the original Return of the Jedi trilogy turned out to be epic and large-scale, and we will also see how the storylines of many of our favorite characters end.A truly iconic part, the second half is one of the best in the history of Star Wars. I want to revise such a film, not episodes 7-9... That's where the story should have ended and not continued!I would not say that there are more impressions than from the fifth episode, it is still darker and better. However, I watched the sixth episode with great enthusiasm and I advise you to watch it!My Rating : 9/10."", 'This final entry in George Lucas\'s STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. However, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. On the contrary. Sure, it\'s not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.The first third of the movie, where Luke and his friends rescue Han from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, is a classic. Jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too. It must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. Actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of Jabba\'s court, including the intimidating, slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster. It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.Things get a little bit slower around the second act, where Luke discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks. Most of the complaints about RETURN OF THE JEDI that I\'ve read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. I don\'t totally agree with that, although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. However, their leader, Wicket (played by Warrick Davis) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the Imperial Troops\' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.By the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the Ewoks battle against the troops, Lando and the Rebel Forces launching an attack against the Empire\'s all-new half-completed Death Star, and Luke\'s final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor. The latter ties with the Jabba Palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. Mark Hamill flexes his acting chops once again as Luke Skywalker in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured Jedi Knight makes for an unforgettable performance. Also, as iconic as James Earl Jones\' voice as Darth Vader is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like Emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by Ian McDiarmid. The tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.The STAR WARS movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in RETURN OF THE JEDI can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. The space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. Of course, given that this movie was made after A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it probably shouldn\'t be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. The acting is classic STAR WARS fare";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But I enjoyed the movie from start to end, even with all the clichés, the americanish touch, the sometimes laughable dialog. This is a movie where you just turn your brain off, and just enjoy the fun ride it is, and root for the humans, and especially the Americans (:p) to win over evil!...The movie I must say has a lot of memorable moments... A lot of them comes from the great special effects. I remember when watching this as a kid, I was woved by the effects, and they still look pretty good to this day! So to end it all, if you are a movie viewer who watches movies for character development, clever dialog, etc. This movie is not for you. If you just want a good time, and a good feeling after watching a movie, I recommend this very much! Thanks for reading, and have a great day!', ""Will Smith at his cocky best. Jeff Goldblum doing Jeff Goldblum stuff. What's not to love. The movie is really funny. Undoubtedly over the top. The story isn't hard to follow. But that suits the pace of the movie. The special effects for the time were excellent and still hold up reasonably well in 2024. The cast is well drilled with no one having a difficult task as most of the characters are pretty uncomplicated. Goldblum is a real treat as is his father and colleague. The drunken pilot is ridiculous. But endearing also. Smith is cocky and slick throughout. Brent spiner plays the emotionally absent scientist very well also. Easy a 7.5. It does not require a brain to watch. It has a load of elements of movies of that era. But it knits them all together into a coherent and enjoyable couple of hours. You can't help but smile and root for the good guys. Great movie. 7.5."", ""What's the fuss about this movie? Why does everyone think so poorly of this? Well, in my opinion they compare this film to the Best Picture movies. This is not a Best Picture film, but a very entertaining popcorn film. This tells the tale of aliens attacking Earth and a group of survivors must unite together to destroy the invading aliens. The acting is decent. Will Smith, with a movie career underway, is excellent. Bill Pullman is great as the President. The effects were amazing especially when the buildings were blown up. David Arnold's music score is just fantastic. The theme is still stuck in my head. Overall, this is an excellent film. I rate this film a 10/10."", 'I used to have this mate that was utterly convinced that this was the greatest film ever made, and I was like ""What? This one? Really?"", and she was like ""Yes it is, and if you don\'t agree then you\'re just plain wrong and stupid"". She was always saying stuff like this, I guess that\'s why we probably grew apart. To be fair I can be a lot like this as well. I think that might have been what went wrong - people who are too similar don\'t often end up getting along. It\'s quite normal for me to resent characteristics in others that I also have and dislike in myself. I think my therapist said that I\'m ""projecting"" or something. Lighting is very good in this film.', 'If this alternate title had been chosen, I would\'ve avoided the loss of two hours of my life and had an extra $9 in my pocket. If you set aside the fact that the aliens in this movie use Macintosh-based computer systems, the Prez hops into a fighter jet AS THE PILOT, and Will Smith punches an alien unconscious in his downed spaceship...this movie is still horrible. Aliens come to earth to sap it of it\'s resources,a nd to accomplish this, of course, the aliens have to destroy earth\'s inhabitants. The enormous spaceships gather above major cities around the globe and WAIT THERE DOING NOTHING FOR DAYS. Then, they start to blow up stuff we recognize (not military targets, just useless tourist attractions that will make us sad). Does blowing up hte White House really accomplish anything? Does it terrify Earth\'s inabitants? the giant spaceships do that just fine. How about attacking military installations capable of fighting back? They can\'t be stopped...or can they? What\'s next?...Not Six Flags over Nebraska!?!?!?! The solution to Earth\'s dilemma lies in the Apple Corporation\'s operating system for home-based computing. Simply walk into an Apple store, grab a Powerbook, fly into the enemy spaceship (how, you ask?....naturally by piloting one of their spacecraft 200 years ahead of earth technology on your first try), mess with their hard drives using an earth laptop computer (I\'m not kidding), and wham-o!!!...Aliens start dropping like flies! Not an ounce of creativity, or originality, or brain-power was used in writing this drivel. I enjoyed all the stereo-typical characters brought together to fight...the drunken former pilot, the hotshot young stud pilot, the computer geek, the kid, and the most powerful man we gots...the PRESIDENT OF THE US...

Oh, if this young heart could talk...Rating: A monumental, romanticizing 10 out of 10.', ""One thing I have to admire about independence day is it's visual effects which are jaw dropping such as The mothership, the city destroyers, the way the city destroyers just erase iconic landmarks and cities(LA, New York and Washington DC), the aliens themselves as well as their personal battle ships. Also the film contains engaging action sequences such as the first assault against the aliens over the ruins of LA, will smith's character on a jet fighting any enemy alien spacecraft in the grand canyon, the president(Bill pullman) confronting a captured alien and lastly the final assault against the city destroyer between human forces and aliens near area 51 as well as Jeff's character & will's character in a captured alien spacecraft deploying the nuke in the mothership and then escaping it before it destroys the mothership. Even area 51 in the film looks more interesting & has a very interesting history. Even a few of the film's quotes such as today we celebrate our independence day(by the president) & Hello boys, I am back(by Russel case) are memorable.However, the film contains a mash of elements from other alien invasion movies and American supremacy. Also, sometimes the characters can be quite annoying and the dialogue was quite weak. Despite this, Independence Day proves Roland Emmerich can make a terrific blockbuster."", ""A very happy ending to a concept that more or less wouldn't be so happy if ended in a realistic manor. Despite this fact, this film brings out the pride In you as a human because it displays our ability to stand up together regardless of our differences. Will Smith adds some of his swagger alongside Jeff Goldblum's always convenient intelligence to create the happy feel American classic that is Independence Day. I also feel they did a quite impressive job on the concept of aliens and tying in Area-51 to the whole story. All and all I was very happy with this film, even though it's incredibly unrealistic and overly optimistic."", '20 years ago, I watched the movie for the first time. I was too young to apprehend the true message that the movie delivered. The movie wants to say that how weak and vulnerable people are when facing sth bigger and greater than them. What touched me was that people with different backgrounds united as one to fight the common enemy that wanted to take their lands and their resources. The movie had great visual effects (maybe not so good nowadays but this was made in the 90s) and great storyline. The storyline was good because it was not just about fending the earth, there were some stories about families too. By the way, when I watched the movie for the first time, I felt sorry for human beings. But now, I am not too sure about that. Humans have done a tremendous damage to the world, sometimes I think humans are just no difference than the aliens that want to evade the earth. The world be be better off without humans.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Its fun and over the top action sequences are heavily inspired by the Roger Moore Bond films. But that isn't a bad thing at all. Although the movie might lack its predecessor's cohesive plot, it certainly makes up for it with the biggest explosion in the world and the absolutely ridiculous plane chase sequence in the snow. Also the inclusion of the classic White tuxedo was a pleasant surprise. While it may not be as good as Casino Royale or Goldeneye and not as well written as Skyfall, it is certainly enjoyable to watch."", ""When rewatching spectre after a few years I realised what an amazing film it actually is. It's far better than the reviews on here claim and after watching it a second time you will truly appreciate it far more than after the first watch."", 'I first saw this with my family in a theatre in 2015.Revisited it recently on a dvd which I own n finished the Bond marathon.This is the the twenty-fourth in the Bond series and the fourth film to feature Daniel Craig as James Bond.This time Bond faces Blofeld, the head of the criminal organisation Spectre, who plans to launch a surveillance network to mastermind criminal activities across the globe.Bond also faces Marco Sciarra n Mr. Hinx.This time Bond gets to cool off with Monica Bellucci n Léa Seydoux.The girl in Mexico is hot but Bond only gets to smooch her.The background music and the character Mr. Hinx are the highlights.The train fight sequence is tension filled.But the helicopter sequence in Mexico is too much cgi filled n the scene where Bond shoots the copter is a bit far fetched along with the scene wher Bond rescues Dr Swan.The silent nature of Mr Hinx (Bautista) succeeded in reviving the quiet henchman archetype of characters such as Jaws n Oddjob.', ""It's overly long, the pacing slows down too much in the second act and Christoph Waltz is massively underutilized but Spectre is still a really good Bond film that's thrilling, fun and epic whilst also being a more classical Bond film.Daniel Craig is reliably perfect once again but with more charisma and a lot more quips compared to his previous films. Léa Seydoux, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Dave Bautista and Ben Whishaw are all great.Sam Mendes' direction is excellent, it's beautifully filmed and consistently stylish with extremely well filmed action sequences. The music by Thomas Newman is fantastic and the song by Sam Smith is also great."", 'Whether you like Daniel Craig as Bond or not, you can\'t deny he has been an integral part of the series\' highest points. Casino Royale is one of the greatest action thrillers ever, let alone Bond movie, and Skyfall is right up there with Goldeneye as a quintessential Bond adventure. Following the magnificent Skyfall, Spectre had some huge shoes to fill, and for the most part, it delivers exactly what you\'d expect. An attention-grabbing, tense opening fight scene, a lovely title sequence (whether the song is good is debatable), and an elaborate sinister plot surrounding James Bond that puts him up against his inner demons more than ever. Does it surpass Casino Royale or Skyfall? Definitely not, but as far as reintroducing the villainous organization SPECTRE into Bond canon after 40+ years, the film does more than a serviceable job, giving us a stylish action-adventure to boot.SPECTRE is revealed to have been affiliated with some of Bond\'s biggest threats - Mr. White, Le Chiffre, Raoul Silva - all under the control of one puppeteer, the head of SPECTRE and James\' archnemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. It isn\'t much of a spoiler, as speculation was rampant ever since the first trailer (and hell, when the name of the movie was released). What\'s important is its execution, and Spectre leaves breadcrumbs for you to follow all the way through the belly of the beast. Not only is Bond under SPECTRE\'s crosshairs, but MI6 itself is experiencing a merger led by Max Denbeigh (Andrew Scott) who wants to eliminate the 00 division and focus solely on global intelligence. It\'s apparent early on that Blofeld has eyes everywhere, and while he works primarily in the shadows (Christoph Waltz only having 20 or so minutes of screen time), he poses a looming threat to Bond because of his sheer cunning and a past secret that unravels itself when the two finally meet.Many parts of the film feel like a throwback to classic Bond. The icy environments, the car chase and gadgetry, the use of a massive threatening henchman, a train fight that is heavily reminiscent of From Russia With Love, and of course the modern birthing of Bond\'s greatest adversary. The acting all around is fantastic, with Craig continuing to impress as the suave womanizing secret agent. Thomas Newman turns in another wonderful musical score. But perhaps the most impressive feature is Sam Mendes\' directing. The shots in this movie are absolutely gorgeous - the action scenes are incredible to watch and easy to follow, the landscapes are fresh and vibrant, and even the simplest of scenes - Bond and Blofeld walking up to each other for the first time - are quietly introspective yet palpably tense. Tension lingers throughout every moment of Spectre even when not much is happening, and the suspense is high enough to hold your interest for the full 2-and-a-half hours.Spectre is not perfect. Much of what happens narratively is predictable, a few lines don\'t go over too well in context, and you eventually find something out about Blofeld that is pretty ridiculous taking previous Bond canon into account. Also, given Waltz\'s reputation for knocking villainous roles out of the park, he\'s noticeably underused here. But these flaws don\'t tarnish the pure entertainment value to be had. What you want in a James Bond movie is over-the-top action surrounding the world\'s greatest spy who\'s up against unbeatable odds yet still comes out on top thanks to his charisma and general badassery, and this is precisely what Spectre delivers. Daniel Craig may or may not return as Bond, and if he doesn\'t, this movie serves as a perfect send-off. But as the series constantly reminds us, ""James Bond will return...,"" and Spectre is just another welcome chapter in the immense story of everybody\'s favorite super spy.', ""If Skyfall was the deconstruction of James Bond, Spectre is the reconstruction. Daniel Craig has returned once more as 007, with Spectre marking his fourth (and potentially final) outing as the character. In Spectre, Bond follows a cryptic message from his past, which leads him to the evil criminal organization known as SPECTRE. After three films, this is the first of the Daniel Craig Bond films that feels more like the Sean Connery/Roger Moore-era Bond adventures, and that is a good thing.Longtime Bond fans should know all about SPECTRE, who were the very same criminal organization that terrorized Bond for almost all of the Sean Connery films (save for Goldfinger). Due to some issues involving legal rights, the filmmakers have not been able to use SPECTRE since the early-to-mid Seventies. Ultimately, the rights were returned just a couple of years ago and now we have SPECTRE's triumphant return in a film that hits all of the beats one expects of a classic Bond adventure: exotic locales, an imposing henchman, some sultry Bond girls with troubled pasts, cool gadgets, and a maniacal villain in the form of Christoph Waltz's Franz Oberhauser. On top of all that, Spectre is chock full of great Bond moments. From an opening action sequence that features one of the finest Bond fight scenes ever, to a Swiss Alps duel between Bond in a plane and the bad guys in SUVs, Spectre finally turns Daniel Craig's Bond into the superhero the character once was, and the 12-year- old inside of me loves it. Of course, the single greatest element of Spectre is not necessarily it's throwback feel or the fact that it's the first Daniel Craig Bond that fully embraces the Bond mythos, but it's how this film effectively ties together all of Craig's Bond movies.Featuring nods to the events of Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, and Skyfall, Spectre kind of feels like the end to the whole enchilada. In some ways, that's good. It has been rumored that this might be Daniel Craig's last Bond film, and if it is, then it is an amazing end to his tenure. No other actor who has ever played Bond has had a run of films as strong as Craig's, and a large part of that is that all of these films have been direct sequels to the others. None of the other Bond films ever really acknowledged any character growth or story progressions from one film to the next, but the Daniel Craig movies all have. The Bond in Casino Royale was brash and impulsive. The Bond in Quantum of Solace was moody and violent in response to Vesper Lynd's death. As for Skyfall, Bond was tired and worn down, a relic searching for a purpose. And Spectre finds Bond struggling with the repercussions of his past while finding his heart and soul once again. By the time the credits roll on Spectre, you really feel as if a myth has been born and Bond is back in tip top shape, better than ever.I give Spectre a 9 out of 10!"", 'James Bond (Daniel Craig) followed the previous M\'s instruction to kill Marco Sciarra. He only shows the message to Moneypenny (Naomie Harris). This leads to an embarrassing Mexico City incident for the new M (Ralph Fiennes) who suspends Bond. M is organizing a merger with MI-5 and C (Andrew Scott) is creating surveillance system ""Nine Eyes"" looking to shut down ""00"". Bond steals a car from Q (Ben Whishaw) to attend Sciarra\'s funeral where he meets his wife Lucia (Monica Bellucci). Using the stolen Sciarra ring, Bond infiltrates a Spectre meeting headed by Blofeld (Christoph Waltz). Dr. Madeline Swann (Léa Seydoux) is the daughter of a murdered Spectre agent and key to bringing down the organization.With the return of Spectre, I was hoping for a great villain to take his place among the greats of Bond villains. Waltz barely gets up in his first scene and takes forever to return. He\'s a missed opportunity for a supervillain. Andrew Scott is the sleazy weasel but he\'s not that guy. This movie is exceedingly cool and filled with sharp action. It\'s missing something. It\'s missing greatness. It\'s missing the great memorable thing. The movie is sometimes a little slow with long expositions. The audience don\'t really need it. They already know who the bad guys are. They just need Bond to catch up and find them. This is a fine Bond movie but one that may be forgotten among the rest.', 'SPECTRE (2015) ***1/2 Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ralph Fiennes, Monica Bellucci, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Dave Bautista, Andrew Scott, Jasper Christensen, Alessandro Cremona, Stephanie Sigman (cameo: Judi Densch) Craig continues to prosper as James Bond (in possibly his swan song turn as 007 if rumor has it) and does so with a bang: out to avenge the recently departed M as well as confront the nefarious leader of the titular conspiracy group hellbent on sabotaging international security at any cost. Waltz is slimily evil as the notorious Blofeld and a continuing supporting crew for Bond including aces-up-his-sleeve Fiennes as the new M, spunky and sexy Harris as Moneypenny and crafty Whishaw as Q. Bautista\'s near mute turn as a brute echoing Robert Shaw\'s blond Russian thug of ""From Russia With Love"" and Richard Kiel\'s Jaws from Roger Moore\'s pair of flicks is indeed formidable and chilling. While there is little believable chemistry between Craig and new Bond gal Seydoux there is the little-used but always welcome sultry Bellucci to spice things up. Director Sam Mendes returns to the franchise pulling out all the stops including a one-take non-cut opening salvo pre-credit trek thru Mexico City\'s Day of the Dead ceremony with Bond tracking an assassin that involves a crumbling hotel and one helluva vertigo inducing chopper sequence. Fast, fun and fierce and by all means make sure to see it in a big-screen/IMAX venue just to invision an 80 foot high Bellucci :D', ""This is certainly not the best Bond film to be made, but it's another solid outing for Daniel Craig's 007.I thought the action, as in pretty much all Bond films, was the standout for me. The train sequence was brilliantly choreographed and the climatic scene added some spectacular set piece action that will be etched into the Bond archives.Performance wise all good as expected once more, however Christoph Waltz as the films leading antagonist provided his usual demonic demeanour and his appreance weaves nicely into the narrative that had been building through the films prior to Spectre.This certainly does no harm to a group of films that has built itself up, especially since Craig has been at the helm, as one of the best action franchises of all time."", 'By the third time a helicopter flew into view, I was exhausted, and dreaded the prospect of yet another interminable and unconvincingly rendered crash scene. The plot was an unappealing mess of recycled ideas. This film brings us yet another revenge story about someone who shares history with Bond but has since turned evil. That was precisely the plot of the last movie - and rather like the last three Star Trek films, most Batman films, the Superman reboot, this year\'s Avengers, etc.Like last time, the stakes are raised by nebulous and non- frightening, yet world threatening (so we are told, but never shown) computer network technology. The film once again focuses on the question: ""are spies still relevant?"" I don\'t find that to be an interesting premise for a Bond film. Why not just assume that the answer is \'yes\' and make a fun and smart action movie with a heart? Casino Royale nailed this. If you really must cover the question of whether your main character is relevant, then at least deal with it once and accept the answer! In Skyfall we learned that you still want a man in the field. In this movie, we learn that you still want a man in the field (and, in case anyone was still not getting it, poor Ralph Fiennes in his role as a flaccid M spells it out literally).While I liked both actors involved, I didn\'t care for the romance - the movie desperately wants to build it up to be something more than an just another Bond girl. That is an admirable idea, but since the result pales in comparison to the stellar romance in Casino Royale, it seems totally unconvincing when Bond sacrifices his entire career for her at the end. Holy moly - Bond settles down? For THIS girl? What an ending to Craig\'s character arc that started with Vesper\'s death (so much more meaningful than anything in any of the other Craig Bond films). Bam, all his emotional problems are solved, because he met a hot blonde. ""I\'ve got something better to do than all this!"" (throws gun away, gets into car with whatshername). Gee, great ending.All the interesting plot developments from Casino Royale and (and even Quantum of Solace to some extent), such as Bond\'s emotional state after losing Vesper and the Quantum organization, are chucked out the window. Skyfall discarded Quantum in favor of a good idea (Bond/M son/mother relationship) and a bad one (""is MI6 still relevant?""). Now, Quantum is back... Kinda. This time, it forms no threat at all - you see, it turns out this OTHER organization that THIS movie is about is even moar powerfuller. And it was really this other, super duper evil organization all along. Muahaha!That is a tiresome plot twist if ever I\'ve seen one. It completely missed the mark for me";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn\'t run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn\'t stop laughing.I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis\'s Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like \'being all you can be\' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I\'ll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - ""I want to try even though I could fail..."". It\'s a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don\'t measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message.', ""As much as I liked movies like Toy Story and Finding Nemo, it made me curious about other CGI animated movies.

The most important messages to me were that you can be whatever you want to be, overcome all barriers presented to you, no matter who or what you are and, all worlds, societies and cultures benefit and become better through diversity, difference and working together. If they'd farmed a few hoomans they could have ticked the climate change box as well (filthy and ignorant beasts that they are)."", ""This is a wonderful animation film that definitely surprised me! Expecting it to be another average Disney film, I was delighted to find it was not quite so. First of all, the animation is extremely well done which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. The amount of details is astonishing and watching it twice was not a punishment for me. The plot is also surprisingly well thought-of, being funny yet dramatic and it keeps you on your seat while also making you laugh multiple times. Although a city full of anthropomorphic animals that dress and act like humans has been extremely popular since animation existed, I believe this Disney movie takes it to a new level. It really does feel like everything took years to develop as the environment is complex and believable and the animal characters resemble their real-life counterparts remarkably well. It's amazing how they could produce a movie with simple jokes suitable for kids yet still silently addressing real-life issues at the same time. At last, I definitely recommend this movie for the whole family as I deem it enjoyable for all ages."", 'The film features anthropomorphic animals who wear garments but for  some reason no shoes.

She would, however, return, pass every test  and finally become a cop. After dealing with parking violators, Judy is  assigned to find a missing critter.

Almost.', 'Zootopia is known to be one of the very best movies that Disney made. Everything in the movie has a deep message that teach everyone about the movie. Never Give Up. ""Nobody learns without getting it wrong.""', 'Is a movie that you can watch with your family, with great 3D animations.', 'Zootopia is another attempt to propagandize for multiculturalism, coming from the same studio which once produced an uplifting allegory for traditional white identity and aristocracy. In line with the dominant elite view on race, it manages to simultaneously push wild-eyed optimism and a paranoid victim attitude. Considering that it met with very positive critical response, including praise for its political message, the subtitle might as well be This is What Our Elites Actually Believe.As the title implies, the film depicts an unrealistic society inhabited by various animals. The heroine, Judy Hopps, is an effervescent rabbit from a rural area whose parents hope that she will become a carrot farmer like themselves. Their bluntly stated and cartoonish view is that you should not try new things because you might fail. Rejecting this view, Judy aspires to be a police officer, unmoved by their insistence that no bunny has ever held that title. A fox bully assaults her and tells her again of the mismatch between her species and her career aspirations, but she ignores this as well.The multicult message continues when Judy gets ready to leave for Zootopia to begin her law enforcement career. Her parents display excessive concern over her possible future encounters with foxes, offering her fox repellent and even a taser to defend herself with. They remind her of her experience with the fox Gideon Grey who assaulted her years ago, but our heroine recites lines to the effect of ""NAXALT"" and ""some of us are jerks too.""Nick then recounts how he consciously decided that if others saw him as untrustworthy, he might as well act that way. Now an adult, he had bragged earlier in the film that he had been running scams every day since the age of 12. There was no mention of previous antisocial tendencies. The accusation that others\' rejection can turn an otherwise respectable person into a professional lowlife is of course paranoid, but familiar to anyone who has heard the terms ""marginalized"" or ""stereotype threat."" The fox serves as an expression of the external locus of control so common among dysfunctional people.Blaming external racist forces for degeneracy in one\'s own group should be a familiar concept to American viewers. This plot point is reminiscent of conspiracy theories about the CIA inventing and/or distributing crack cocaine to keep the Black man down, or similar popular theories concerning HIV. The seminal 1944 title An American Dilemma by the Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal accused White prejudices of encouraging low standards of morality among Blacks, which in turn reinforced White prejudices, and so on in a vicious cycle.Of course, today even the implication that there are different standards of morality between races or nationalities would be dismissed as racist. Other than of the victims of the conspiracy, there is no mention in the film of any actual difference in values or behavior between contemporary predators and prey animals.However, the differences between species in Zootopia are dramatic, not only in size and shape but in some aspects of behavior. The sloths who form the staff of the DMV are as slow as actual sloths, even in their speech. There is no pretense of equality in this context";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The characters were fascinating and the special effects were truly pretty good--and that's saying something, since I'm usually bored out of my mind by that kind of thing.Some of the acting was absolutely wonderful.

Brian Singer himself must've been sweating adamantium bullets, not only being held under the gun by the studio to lead their next big moneymaker, but most importantly and fortunately for us because of his deep and honest desire to make the most accurate and cohesive comic book-to-film adaptation in the history of cinema.  Well Brian I am thrilled to say that that is precisely what has been achieved with your amazing film X2: X-Men United!It has become rarer and rarer to find a film that has the ability to grab your senses and lock your attention so firmly, not ever letting up until the credits role, such as this film does.  One might only be able to count a handful of films where a sequel takes all of the good elements form it's predecessor, completely eliminates the things that didn't work or fit in the original, then goes on to not only exceed the expectations and hype surrounding it, but completely redefines and elevates it's genre.

A decent sequel exiting at in interesting point for a potential 3rd movie."", ""Surprised that this movie was good. Comparable to the first. The plot was the exact same thing as the first, but by adding new characters and switching up who's in who's body, it kept things fun and entertaining. Very funny, Kevin Hart was hysterical acting like Danny Glover, one of the highlights of the film. Unlike the first, this one had some good fight scene, and a few nice twists. Overall, just a fun entertaining movie. It doesn't stand above the first from 2017, not better not worse. If you didn't like the first, highly doubt you'll enjoy this one any more. But it's still funny for those entertained by the first."", 'This was a fun time. The cast and performances are both very good here. It\'s a fun popcorn movie - although, there are some ""shocks"" and somewhat violent deaths throughout which I found jarring and a strange tone choice. However, this is a great bunch of likable comedy actors/young actors being given the freedom to have fun in these roles. There are also some exciting set-pieces and creative vfx. It was a wise choice to bring back the entire cast too, with some new additions. I\'d recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a fun action-packed video game/blockbuster with likable and entertaining actors. But beware of the jump scares and ""scary"" animals if you\'re sensitive to that sort of thing.', ""It didn't need Danny Devito or Glovers characters in it. Their characters inept way of understanding what was going on got old."", ""It is not so impressive as previous one. Character transformation is some way working not for all.

Nothing will ever replace them original with Robin Williams. But Welcome to the Jungle and The Next Level have been hits. The story, the acting and the action has been fantastic. The Rock really should be up for an Oscar for his role in playing a senior Danny Devito. My only bug bear about this movie - was the lack of animals in it. No Lions, tigers, elephants or anything from the previous movies. Just a snake, Monkeys, ostrich and some camels. The Robin Williams version made it sound this place was the scariest place alive. However the story and action was still very entertaining - and worth the dollars to see. A great family adventure movie everyone will enjoy!"", ""Didn't have high hopes, but really enjoyed this!

There are some sequences that don\'t seem to have any real sense or purpose and are not very funny or interesting, like the whole ""switch players while bathing in green goo"", which actually happens _twice_ in the movie...Of course, part of it is because the concept has already been explored in the first movie, so it\'s not as interesting this time around. But, still, they could have done it a little better, rather then trying to do it ""a little less"".On the plus side, Kevin Hart does a _great_ impression of Danny Glover.While it\'s an OK watch, I don\'t think it improves on the experience you get from the first movie and I don\'t believe you can fully enjoy it without watching the first movie, so, I would not recommend watching it.', 'Loved the edition of Awkafina/Devito/GloverFully enjoyed the silliness of this movie. Pure Fun and laughs. Nice touch at the end.', ""I really enjoyed the first movie but this one, not so much. The jokes seemed forced and not particularly funny.

It has been turned into a Bay movie ... the premise more or less is the same.

He must fight throughout all of them in order to deposit his gold.The first impressions of Sisu gave me that it was a bloody, fun, and good time of a gold miner killing Nazis. Since John Wick was heavily inspired by director, Jalmari Helander, that this movie is basically the German 1940's war version of John Wick. Jorma Tommila's (main protagonist) acting skills were badass from his creative surviving skills to kill the Nazis. The deaths were entertaining with the special effects and CGI of them. Overall, Sisu is good with its acting, kills, and story. I would recommend Sisu in theaters for a good action watch."", ""For as much as there is to like about Sisu, and there is a lot, the film does ask the viewer in equal parts to continuously suspend reality. Sisu is at its best in close quarters combat, when the fists and knives take center. The cinematography plays with the vast landscapes and camera techniques (one forced perspective shot of a tank staring down the gold prospector left me awestruck). The brisk runtime of 91 minutes ensures there aren't many lulls between Nazi blood being spilled. There is copious gore from both Nazis and our protagonist's unwilling desire to die. There are even damsels in distress.I cannot say Sisu is exactly what I expected from the trailer, because truth be told, I wasn't expecting mimicry sequences of Mission Impossible hanging from a plane, Rambo stalking with a survival knife, or the other half dozen far-fetched antics. The film's unwilling desire to never take itself too seriously is both why it works so good, and perhaps what ultimately keeps it from being even better..."", 'A lone prospector, Sisu, returning from the wilderness with bags full of gold encounters a detachment of Nazi soldiers who decide to take the gold for themselves. Sisu is no mere person however, but the human embodiment of mythic Finnish determination in the face of overwhelming odds. ""Koshi"" is the name that Russian soldiers gave to him, which means ""immortal."" In other words, Sisu is a one-man death squad. The Germans are told to let the man be and that they are lucky to be alive, but they laugh and ignore the warnings. What follows are battles on land, in mine fields, above the clouds, and under water, between devastating force and a sole, determined, and mysteriously powerful individual who stubbornly refuses to give up.Indiscriminate killings and other violence dominate this irreverent, bloody, and enticing film. While I wish the dialogue and other aspects of the film were better, I loved the thrilling action and the explosive and cathartic retelling of this Finnish legend. Director Jalmari Helander of Rare Exports and Big Game fame, was present along with some of the main actors for this Toronto International Film Festival, midnight madness, and world premiere screening. After a three-hour plane delay in New York I arrived at the last minute to the packed Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto and the refreshing roar and hilarious jeers of the midnight madness crowd. It was so much fun.', ""Sure, it was ridonculous and fun, but this could've easily been so much better had the filmmaker spent less time with the repetitive logic-defying suspension of disbelief with the outrageous confrontations and deadly fight scenes, and focused more on a singular theme and tone for the dramatics, with expanding on the narrative - instead of plugging in pointless chapters. You can take only so much nonsense before you start thinking if this is a war parody film. A little more dialogue and character building would've also gone a long way. Even at a mere 91 min runtime and the decent pacing, there was barely a story here to make a short film, let alone 91 mins. At least the cinematography, S/VFX and gore were top-notch though. Nevertheless, an entertaining popcorn actioneer."", 'At its core, ""Sisu"" is an unapologetic homage to the one-man-army trope, reminiscent of the over-the-top heroics found in Telugu action films. The protagonist, Aatami Korpi, is a force of nature, a man whose survival defies logic, much like the heroes who walk away from explosions unscathed. His invincibility is both the film\'s strength and its Achilles\' heel, offering a narrative that is as indestructible as it is implausible.Yet, amidst the chaos of its plot, ""Sisu"" stands tall with its stunning cinematography and special effects. The film crafts a visual feast that can only be described as mesmerizing. Each frame is a testament to the filmmakers\' dedication to creating a spectacle that captivates the senses.', ""First off, let me say that the cinematography in this movie is sick. The effects were amazing. It's bloody, it's unapologetically violent. But unfortunately that's all there is to it.If you want to enjoy this movie, switch off your brains because it will insult your intelligence. The problem with such movies is that, even though it's a fictional story, they paint a picture of realness but fail to develop actual real scenarios.The reason why movies like James Bond, Equalizer, Borne, Mission Impossible and even John Wick, to an extent, work, is because the directors created scenes which where very much believable. This movie was unbelievable from the very beginning.All the three soldiers had to do was point and shoot which they didn't do. I don't know why they chose to fight instead. Then you had the landmine scene which was laughable. How does a horse get blow up and the rider, not a scratch? Then you have several soldiers firing randomly in one direction and they completely missed you and you didn't step on any landmine? Then you had the sniper who misses every single shot and even when using the heavy gun, he seem to get the dead guy being carried by the man, but when the dead guy is dropped, he can't get the guy himself? And you mean to tell me that the guys walking behind the trucks, couldn't see him rolling on the floor? They didn't see him kill the soldiers, enter the truck and hand over guns to the women? If there's gasoline, you check the gas tanks, no? And when they finally caught him, they hung him? Someone who could hold his breath under water for hours?! You decide not to shoot him?! And theeeeeeeennnn when you thought it couldn't get worse, he hits a MOVING plane with an axe, held onto it for it for a lift off and still managed to release the axe, pierce an armored plane with it whilst in mid air, enters the plane in time before the villain could get to him. And when the villain finally got to him and beat him to a pulp, he forgot he has a gun he can use to kill him, but rather, chose to use a rope?! Absolutely Ridiculous. And the last insult was when the plane crashes headfirst, minutes later man gets out holding his axe, unhurt, unscratched, eyes still white as snow, he rides to the bank with his gold and demands for cash.NONSENSE!"", 'I\'m not sure but i believe this film is loosely based on the Finnish sniper Simo Hayha, ""the white death"". Or at least the protagonists back story.I\'ll keep it short and sweet. If you like rough action and satisfying villain deaths, watch it. It\'s grimm and hard. There is not a whole lot of dialogue in the movie. I think it\'s not until the very end of the movie that the hero speaks. It\'s well filmed with beautiful shots at times and the score fits well.That being said, it\'s at the end where it all goes off the rails for me. There is some stuff that happens with an airplane which is just ridiculous. It\'s a bit of a shame because it was not necessary for me for the movie to have such a fast and furious style end sequence.I enjoyed it but yeah... that end bit just didn\'t do it for me.', ""No need for dialogue. The protagonist tells his story through carefully choreographed movements and facial expressions. He earned a name and showed why it was deserved. Like RRR, I appreciate taking a legend or regional lore and building a new story from it.I like the villain as well. He was believable, tough and cocky. Not sure if he improvised or directed to do the little things that stood out to me. A look here, a gesture there. I liked him.I'm willing to suspend belief when in the cinema, but there's one glaring problem, for me. His sidekick. Especially at the very end. It doesn't compute. In all, worth the money spent, great pacing, made me feel something and great length. A minute longer would've ruined it. Yes, some suspension of belief is needed, but I loved First Blood with Sly, and the Spartacus series, so I'm loving this. 7.5 for me, but there's no decimal here."", ""I saw Sisu, starring Jorma Tommila-Man and a Junior, Big Game";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It's like watching a comic book video game put to screen. The action is insane, over the top and super high energy with wonderfully creative framing and visual cues.Going back and watching it again, it's amazing how many people are in this before they were huge. Brie Larson, Chris Evans, Anna Kendrick just to name a few. The visuals still hold up, as does the pointed commentary on hipsters.Great music, great action, great performances. It's all around a fantastic experience. The only real downside to me is that it's based on something with a lot of content and in an effort to put a lot in here there are some moments that feel... Off. Areas where the graphic novel likely went into great detail yet the movie has to just sort of pop it in and run with it. These are mostly minor but it still prevents this from being absolutely perfect."", ""Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a slacker hipster in a garage band who's dating high school girl Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). He is self-absorbed and willing to abandon Knives as soon as he meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Before Scott can date Ramona, he must defeat her seven exes.Scott is a douche. The biggest problem for me is his unlikeability. It runs counter to Cera's usual good guy persona. Everybody is blasé and sarcastic which get some good laughs.The best thing about this is the 80s video game visual motif. Edgar Wright brings a fresh hip-without-the-irony sensibility. It also uses Toronto not as New York or as anything other than Toronto. It's refreshing and unique in a world where almost everything is a sequel."", 'I came to this films with no preconceptions of it as a movie and I have to say I am glad. I guess I was expecting another Michael Cera movie about some dopey kid in love. And thats what it is ... but done in a unusually great way. For anyone under 25 brought up on gaming (I am 30 and not) this will be just brilliant. The style of the movie with its ""end of level baddies"", game-play set-up and visuals are a welcome and refreshing twist on what could have been a hum-drum movie. The music rocked, the comedy was fast, slick and laugh out loud ... I\'d definitely recommend this to my friends looking for something that little bit special.', 'I have a feeling that many young people would go ape for ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"". It involves both young people, and its video game elements will be greatly appealing to youths. However, I think older people (like myself) will be somewhat let down by the movie.Before I get to criticizing the movie, let me say that I did feel the movie had SOME positive elements. The visual effects are top notch, successfully crossing live action with what you might see in a video game. There are also a lot of small touches here and there that are amusing, like defeated opponents transforming into coins.The visual look of the movie combined with those small touches ALMOST makes up for the flaws in the movie. The source of all the flaws is the same: the script. The script is really inadequate in a number of areas. The biggest flaw is that except for the character of Knives, NONE of the characters are sympathetic or appealing. They come across as thoughtless and kind of dumb, especially the title figure. Another script problem is that much of the movie consists of it repeating several times stuff that has already happened. The movie becomes monotonous after a while. Also, the ending is very frustrating, with Scott (in my opinion) choosing the wrong person to be with.I have not read the graphic novel series this movie is based on, but my guess is based on its length, a LOT of character development and story was cut out in order to make the movie last a little under two hours. So if you have a choice, I would advise you read the multi-part graphic novel instead of seeing this movie.', 'A very interesting movie I really enjoyed watching, my best character in the movie was Wallace, while the worst character was the Chinese girl, it was very annoying, the fights were fun, I felt that the movie was directed at me, I recommend watching it', ""Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ellen Wong and Kieran Culkin star in this 2010 action-comedy based on the comics/graphic novels. Cera (Superbad) plays the title role of Scott, a nerdy, American teen who plays in a band with his pals and is trying to get over a recent break-up with a girl. He starts dating Asian girl, Knives (Wong), but eventually falls for other girl, Ramona (Winstead) and tries to break it off with knives. Scott learns that Ramona has 7 ex-lovers he must battle with if he wants to stay with her. Culkin (Home Alone) plays Scott's gay roommate, Wallace. Chris Evans (Captain America), Brandon Routh (Superman Returns), Brie Larson (21 Jump Street) and Anna Kendrick (Pitch Perfect) also appear. This is a pretty good film that pokes fun/pays tribute to comic books and videogames. The cast is decent and there's neat effects. Check this one out at least once."", 'Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is in his early twenties and has started dating a girl named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) who is still in high school. The news circulates around all of his friends including his gay roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin) and his nosey sister Stacey (Anna Kendrick). At first Scott enjoys the company of Knives. She watches his band play during their practice sessions. At a party though Scott meets who he believes is the girl of his dreams in Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He opts to go out with Ramona instead and decides to breakup with Knives. Yet when his band is performing at a gig, Scott is confronted by one of Ramona\'s seven ex-boyfriends. This leads to a series of video game style fight sequences where Scott must take on each of Ramona\'s exes, many of which have superhuman powers of their own and defeat them so he can date her properly.Although Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has been adapted from a 2004 graphic novel series, it is to a fault like a computer game. It\'s been directed by Edgar Wright, who previously worked on Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Hot Fuzz (2007). He has chosen to shoot the film with an overwhelming number of visual tricks that look to have come straight from the graphic novel source and the arcades machines. When someone knocks on Scott\'s door the onomatopoeic words appear on the screen. When Scott kisses Ramona tiny hearts trickle out between them. During the fight scenes icons popup to reveal Scott\'s high scores, like an arcade game. But Wright seems too excited by these gimmicks and they are used too frequently. Rather than being charming little treats for the audience, they quickly become excessive. The film\'s rapid pacing is also problematic. As the director and one of the film\'s screenwriters Wright seems highly intent on moving through the film\'s opening quarter as quickly as possible, with rapid cutting hurling the audience from one scene to another. Given the speed of the first act and the array of video game aesthetics thrown in, the rest of the film desperately lacks urgency. It fires all its shots at once and then there is no momentum to build upon with any of the fight scenes, leaving the movie at a monotone rate. Scott Pilgrim already knows how to fight too so there is no character development or exposition here either. Each fight sequence feels no more significant than the last. It makes for extremely repetitive viewing, with at least three exes too many and just not enough substance.Michael Cera has potential as a comic actor but the script here does not allow him to develop anything new beyond his trademark dopey persona. Given how engaging he has been in films like Juno (2007), it is surprising how dislikeable he is here. The way that he treats Knives and gets away with it makes him less appealing as a protagonist. It does not help that Cera is forced to deliver dialogue that is entirely self- conscious in its attempts to be hip. No one has anything interesting or funny to say here. When his sister Stacey asks him if he really thought that he had a future with Ramona he replies thickly: ""Like with jetpacks?"" There is an overdose of style here and not an ounce of sincerity. A lot of the other performers are wasted too. Anna Kendrick, a talented actress from films like Twilight and Up in the Air (2009), is barely seen and no matter how cool and alternative Winstead\'s hair looks her character is still underwritten. It\'s disappointing that the exes fail to reveal anything about her past. Jason Schwartzman has only a small role as the film\'s central baddie and it would have been nice to see more of him in the film because he is a regularly enjoyable talent on-screen.Despite the efforts of director Edgar Wright to bombard the audience with an array of visual tricks, there is little by way of substance to be found in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Its computer game counterpart probably soars on its artistic flair but this film disregards too many of the basics of screen writing. It\'s pacing runs on a single, exhausting note and does not give enough urgency to the repetitive fight sequences. The lack of a substantial narrative here diminishes any possible depth the performances might have had too. It\'s so intent on being hipster cool that it forgets about keeping it real. Exit game.', 'This is truly a brilliant, refreshing movie. I must say that I didn\'t quite know what to expect but except that I thought this movie was for teenagers and I was terribly wrong. I am 40 years old and I TRULY enjoyed this movie and it had a clear story line that targeted more than just teenagers. In addition, I saw every age group, race, gender in the screening that I attended which was impressive and we all were jumping and laughing at every scene as if we were all teenagers.

This is a real Christopher Nolan movie, not a Batman, but a real Christopher Nolan movie like Memento or Prestige. Watch it a few times. Pay attention to the details. Appreciate the sensory experience.Most of these bad reviews are because the person watched it once and was upset they weren't spoon fed every aspect of the characters and story. There is a ton of characterization and a great story but you have to pay attention."", 'Christopher Nolan is a visual genius: this film is just stunning to look at. From the bullets flying near soldier\'s head to gorgeous explosions, it transports you right into the war zone within the first 10 minutes of the screening. Furthermore, it is an accurate description of the ""Miracle of Dunkirk"". This is where the movie nails it. However, apart from that, I\'ve had a couple of issues with it.The film is told from three perspectives: Air, Mole and Sea. This is where the movie falls a bit short. The editing at some points feels lazy and not very consistent: it cuts from a dramatic scene or intense action scene very quickly. The film is told in a non-linear way: this makes us watch certain scenes twice through different perspectives. Although this could\'ve been done in a very interesting way, it\'s very difficult to keep track of whose perspective we\'re watching at times. Even when certain semi-important (I\'ll get back to this later) soldiers die, it took me a while to realise this happened.This is where my third and final problem come into question: the characters lack depth. You don\'t care about the main character, nor any of the other soldiers that are dying. If I\'m watching a film about war, I like to bond with the characters I\'m seeing on screen. If none of them show any real emotion, the viewer won\'t as well.All in all, Dunkirk could\'ve been amazing. I personally don\'t understand why it has such a high rating besides being directed by a very well-known director / starring famous actors (including infamous Harry Styles) / being a war biography. Disappointing.', 'For the majority of his career Christopher Nolan has thrived in surrealism, whether it be focusing on caped crusaders or unchartered space missions. So it\'s intriguing to see him return to a narrative steeped in realism, and grounded by its commitment to real life occurrences. The results are staggeringly impressive too, while the talented filmmaker maintains his creative sensibilities, crafting a war movie that feels distinctively his.When thinking about war films, it\'s very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan.You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those.Naturally I was excited for the movie and I think most people were because we knew that it is Nolan\'s movie. From the opening shot of dunkirk you are in it and You are experiencing everything like you are there , there\'s never a dull moment or scene where characters sit around a campfire and say who you got back home no background stories. You don\'t get those kind of things in Dunkirk what you are used to see in war films yeah this could be a problem because you don\'t feel connected to specific characters and you are not connected emotionally but this movie is not like others there are many war movies and we have seen many similar things but this movie is not about individual it\'s completely about the event. It\'s about the evacuation like being in the middle of this horrific situation. According to my opinion When you are in a situation like this you don\'t say ""hey my name is.....what\'s yours where are you from - oh I thought we could have a conversation between all the bombs and planes firing constantly"" No this movie is in the moment and how Nolan show us the event It\'s what movies were invented for. everything on the screen look completely authentic there\'s never a moment that feels wasted. When I heard that it\'s only 106 minutes long I thought it should be 3 hours long movie but when I saw that it starts in battle and ends in battle I think it\'s perfectly made in one and half hour. And if you\'re expecting big arcs then sorry because sometimes in war people die alone and no one\'s there to comfort them or tell them it\'s going to be OK that\'s what make this movie so terrifying.""Dunkirk"" tells the story of a group of allied soldiers from Belgium, France, and the British Empire. When they find themselves surrounded by the Germany army on the beaches of Dunkirk, the film follows the story of the evacuation of 400,000 during the early stages of World War II.boasting an incredible cast, Christopher Nolan allows his players to internalize the fear and emotion, and allow them to express it in the most aromatic and penetrating demeanor\'s. As Tommy, Fionn Whitehead makes an astounding mark in his feature film debut. With no true lead in the movie, his point of view is often a crutch for the audience to rest upon, as his internalization of the character is one of the film\'s most pivotal high points.It is gripping from its very opening moments, in which we see soldiers getting picked off by invisible snipers in the middle of the titular town as propaganda flyers shower from overhead, announcing to the British, French, Canadian, Belgian and Dutch troops that they are hopelessly penned in by the Germans.We are in the early months of World War Two.Christopher Nolan makes the decision to avoid all of this explanation, and to give us a Dunkirk that focuses on the personal experiences of the war by land, sea and air The sea battle is also done very well from a technical perspective. We get a sense of the claustrophobia of being aboard ship, the shell-shock and the terror of a watery death, especially when combined with lit gasoline. I thought the acting was by far the best in this segment. I very much liked Mark Rylance\'s quiet earnestness as a civilian sailor sailing to Dunkirk with his son - the quiet communication between the two of them with glances - the profound sympathy toward Cillian Murphy\'s traumatised rescued RAF pilot. And the scene of soldiers drowning under a fiery sea is one of the most memorable and rightly horrific in the film.Dunkirk is edge of your seat filmmaking. Can honestly say I\'ve never seen anything like it.A lot of people were wondering about Harry_styles & unknown cast. They\'re all great but Dunkirk is not about any one solider. Also \'Dunkirk\' is another brilliant collaboration between Nolan & HansZimmer. The way he mixes in a ticking clock with score is nail biting.DUNKIRK relies on very little dialogue.We all know what happened on that beach, but Nolan\'s take is worth visiting. Yes, DUNKIRK relies heavily on sound of an increasingly fast ticking clock to build suspense.Drop everything and go watch Dunkirk. It is an experience. Not a mere film.', 'I would concur with many that the film was overhyped. Nevertheless, to give something as breathtaking in its cinematic efforts a one or two is ridiculous. I guess people who are into war film are not unlike the fanboys in the Marvel world. This is an intense film. I\'ll admit that if I had to depend on it to explain the actual events of the Dunkirk rescue, I would say it was lacking. It\'s no ""Tora Tora Tora"" or ""The Longest Day"" which depict the breadth of the subject of war. It focuses more on fragile individuals who are more realistic. One reviewer referred to two of the men as cowards, doing whatever they could to stay alive. As if those who were trapped by the Germans wouldn\'t do whatever they could to stay alive. Yes, there is a bit of tackiness. These are fictional characters. There\'s lots of heroism to go around. There is cowardice. This is war and war is not desirable. Still, with a big picture attempt it would have been much better.', ""I was very disappointed with this movie. I have liked previous Nolan movies but this one left me feeling cheated that I had spent that much money to see it. It was boring and unrealistic.One scene had a ship getting hit with a bomb and immediately rolling on it's side then remaining afloat.At the end a plane runs out of fuel and seemingly defies the laws of physics by gliding forever and ever shooting down a plane before landing on the beach. They kept showing shots of the beach with lines of soldiers that nowhere approximated over 400,000 soldiers. Same with the amount of ships and boats and planes. The hype of this being one of the best war movies ever had me expecting something special. Instead it had me sitting there wondering when the fantastic movie was going to start. I waited in vain. Instead I left the show with a headache from the noise bombardment from the soundtrack.My biggest sense of wonder was that they had spent that much money making it. I wanted to like this movie but it never happened for me."", ""What a Brilliant movie. We saw this on the night of the World Premiere, intense and packed full of fabulous acting... The camera shots were absolutely spot on, and you couldn't look away for a second without missing a perfect scene. The entire score, coupled with the dialogue and videography made this film and I cannot wait to see it again."", ""This review will be mostly spoiler free but I don't want to be banned so I clicked it just to be safe..The basic plot revolves around the 450,000 odd British soldiers trapped in Dunkirk, France as the German troops close in. They don't close in on foot though, instead opting to pick the trapped soldiers off from the air and sea.This movie isn't a propaganda piece touting the glory of British resilience";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The video games are work of art. This movie is formulaic, cheesy, unrealistic, and a slap in the face to the greatness of the game.

But overall it's worth time and money.You Won't regret it."", ""Saw it last night and I have to say, I was really surprised. As someone who essentially grew up with the game, the nostalgic factor was a really good thing which helped one up the movie. The story being a mix of all the uncharted games makes it underwhelming and hard for the audience to really click with the movie but that's expected since you can't really get the same engagement from a 30+ hour game from a movie. But, the movie tries it's best and I'd say it works in a way. Tom doesn't quite capture the essence of Nate's character but he does deliver a good performance which I have to say exceeded my expectations. Sully's character was a lot flawed in a lot of ways but Wahlberg gives his character a moment here and there which at times clicks really well. The action sequences are really cool and just doesn't bore you in anyways and the movie is a fairly nice watch and is one of the better video game movies made in my opinion."", ""This movie is really good and I would watch it again, it's action packed and full of adventure and there is some cringe here and there but overall it's better than what most people say."", ""Uncharted is by no means a smart or original film but its still a really fun movie that's fast paced and consistently exciting whilst also being somewhat faithful to its source material.Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg do not embody their video game counterparts however they still give likeable and charismatic performances with solid chemistry.

Art and commerce in a delicious salad with all the right ingredients. A brisk screenplay by Ernest Lehman a Cary Grant that is just pure delight, Eva Marie Saint fresh out of her Oscar from ""On the Waterfront"" is an icy blonde with a brain. James Mason, the ultimate foreign sinister not to mention Jessie Royce Landis and Hitchcock brings Bernard Herrmann to wrap it all up in one of the most infectious scores imaginable. A real treat.', ""My favourite director, Alfred Hitchcock has directed many classics like Psycho, Rear Window and Vertigo, and I will say that this deserves to be up there among his best. I absolutely loved it! The best aspect of this movie is the always charming Cary Grant in a brooding and entertaining performance as Roger Thornhill, a man wanted for the murder of a diplomat. Solidly supporting him all the way are the lovely Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendell and oily James Mason as the villainous Vandamme. They are further advantaged by some excellent camera-work and a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The script is focused and suspenseful, and Hitchcock's direction ensures the film rarely slips, even if some of the complicated plot does fly over people's heads. The climax though is simply the icing on the cake. Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, which I will give a 9.5/10. Bethany Cox"", 'VERTIGO did nothing to advance Hitchcock\'s career in 1957 when he released it, and it\'s actually not a shame: the following year he decided to go completely against the slow-moving erotic thriller genre and do something shamelessly commercial, escapist and single-handedly create the spy movie. Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond novels, states he based his character on the physical characteristics and the suave personality of Cary Grant, as an added note. This could well amount to be the first James Bond film -- a dangerous villain complete with a sidekick, an alluring woman with a dubious nature and an enigmatic ""boss,"" a dashing hero, lush locales setting the scene for powerful chases and escalating danger.NORTH BY NORTHWEST has one crucial difference to any James Bond film, though: Alfred Hitchcock. While the Bond films have been seen as quintessential action fluff (although fluff of the better kind until the franchise ran out of gas in the 80s), Hitchcock, always the master of subtext as well as suspense, creates memorable scenes that balance sexual tension, sexual innuendo, comedy, and mounting suspense seamlessly. There is never the feeling of being bored as there is too much going on, especially with the sizzling chemistry of Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant, by now a Hitchcock veteran. When they\'re on screen, dialog crackles and so much more is said with so little gesture -- she closes the lid on her Ice Goddess role, but gives it a nice, cheeky, knowing wink. He of course evolves from the sort of man who while looking and being slightly clumsy and under his mother\'s thumb -- once it becomes clear he\'s been marked and is a target for a sinister plot that only later becomes clear -- becomes more assertive in taking matters into his own hands. A quintessential Hitchcock Everyman, Grant has his stamp all over his role. No one can imagine anyone else running away from that crop duster in one of the movies many standout sequences, or saying the reassuring last words to Eva Marie Saint as they cuddle together in the train. When one thinks of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, one thinks Cary Grant.Easily one of Hitchcock\'s best films, made while he was at the peak of his career in the bracket formed with THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and MARNIE. Great supporting performances are all over the map, from Jesse Royce Landis as Grant\'s mother, James Mason as Phillip Vandamm, Martin Landau as Vandamm\'s protégée who might be a little more than that, and Leo G Carroll as The Professor. Doreen Lang appears early in the movie as Grant\'s secretary";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Arnold fits perfectly in the role of Doug Quaid (definitely his best acting in a movie to date) the confused construction worker and Ronny Cox provides his usual evil plotting arch bad-guy. The impressive visual effects are worth the movie's $100million price tag, and Paul Verhoeven proved that, as with Robocop and Starship Troopers, sci-fi is where he does his best work.What does spoil films like these, however, are people who cannot grasp the concept of Science FICTION, and refuse to suspend their belief for 2 hours(a vital part of enjoying these movies). Movies like this don't work without the overplayed violence, cheesy one-liners and stunning effects. Take away any of these elements and you no longer have a sci-fi action movie.Chill out, check out and enjoy..."", ""One of the best mind trips ever, I could only wish this movies was made ten years later. Even for 1990, this film had some of the most imaginative make-up I've ever seen in a movie. While it had Paul Verhoeven's classic shallowness, the film really touched new ground not only with science fiction but also with special effects. Talk a good few years for a director, he not only changed sci-fi with Robocop, he did it again with Total Recall. Verhoeven will never, ever win an Oscar for best director, but his movies will at least be entertaining in most respects."", ""Years later, they made a repeat of this movie. Of course, it was not the same beauty. I watched the first movie again. Our childhood was also a very important movie. Visual effects still look beautiful. It's nostalgia to see the youth of the actors."", 'The worker Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) dreams on Mars for many consecutive nights. He invites his wife Lori (Sharon Stone) to spend vacation on Mars, but she does not agree, since the planet ruled by the tyrant Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox), who sells oxygen for the population, is facing resistance movement and terrorist acts leaded by the mutant Kuato. Douglas decides to go to the Rekall Company to implant virtual vacation memories of Mars for his own satisfaction, using a special program with the identity of a secret agent. While in the process, something goes wrong and Douglas becomes aggressive, and the process is interrupted. While returning home, the life of Douglas turns upside down, and he travels to the red planet trying to disclose who he is.Today I have watched ""Total Recall"" at least for the tenth time, now on DVD. Again, I found it an excellent sci-fi film with non-stop action. The story has many twists, and the screenplay has no flaws, being very attractive. This was the first movie that the beauty of the unknown Sharon Stone (in 1990) called my attention. Arnold Schwarzenegger is great performing a dubious hero, and Michael Ironside is the perfect villain. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Vingador do Futuro"" (""The Avenger of the Future"")', 'Good sci-fi film with classic Arnie action and over the top shooting scenes 80s style. The mutant characters were cool and there are some funny scenes, like the bar shoot out and the eye popping out then returning back to normal lol', ""The premise, a man plagued by memories and unsure whether they are real or false could have made for an intelligent, thought provoking, tense thriller, and indeed it did some six years later in Terry Gilliam's 'Twelve Monkeys'. Unfortunately here the idea is wasted, reduced to a run-of-the-mill actioner, used entirely as a vehicle for the once popular Arnie. There are a dozen running gun battles, but each is exactly the same as the next. Anything that can explode must explode. Anything that can erupt in a spray of blood must explode in a spray of blood.In it's defence, Arnie hasn't made a film in the same league as this since Terminator 2, and it introduced a seductive Sharon Stone ('If you don't trust me you can tie me up') to a wide audience, giving us a taster of what she and Verhoven could do a year later in 'Basic Instinct'. Perfect if you - like the customers at Rekall inc. - have had a labotomy."", ""'Total Recall (1990)' is both an interesting, layered, concept-driven science-fiction film and a squishy, one-liner-filled, Arnold Schwarzenegger action romp, essentially, in equal measure. It's concerned just as much with its special effects and filled-to-the-brim squibs as it is with its twisty narrative and heady ideas. This contrast is, in practice, cohesion. It's what sets the piece apart from almost all others in its genre. It's enjoyable on all levels. It provides breathless, balls-to-the-wall action and an intriguing, ultimately fulfilling narrative filled with well-rounded characters and genuinely clever concepts. The world is incredibly creative and the tone is spot on, in typical Verhoeven fashion. The characters are also great, though, and the way they interact with the central conceit is brilliant. I won't spoil the main twist of the piece but it really is fantastic, something that you'll still be pondering - as a concept - long after the credits have rolled. On the whole, this is a really great film. It's tangible, exciting, inventive and, generally, just entertaining. 8/10"", ""This is my all time favorite movie.

She works as a waitress and encounters a bunch of entitled teenagers. She on purpose spills hot drink on one of those men and they take revenge on her. Her foster mother is killed and her dog is kidnapped. She embarks on another killing spree.It is as fun as the first film and the kills are as more elaborate given that she is now an older teenager. I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel and long may this franchisee continue."", 'In THE WRATH OF BECKY, Lulu Wilson reprises her avenging angel role in order to take on another group of murdering scumbags. This time, it\'s a bunch of knuckle-dragging yahoos known as the ""Noble Men"" (a thinly-veiled reference to a real organization). So, yes, this sequel gets a bit more political. However, that point becomes moot, and all but forgotten, once the first head explodes!After all, these movies are all about Becky, and the fools who dare to cross her. The Directors up the ante in this one, as Becky finds herself in -somewhat- greater peril. Her new adversaries seem to have one or two extra I. Q. points over their predecessors. Well, at least one of them might.The humor level is also higher, with several laugh-out-loud moments.Another gory action-fest for the revenge film aficionado...', ""The Wrath Of Becky is a real treat for those who enjoys stories about revenge. As for me (someone who worships I Spit On Your Grave), this movie is a really delicious meal for my mind. Just like the first movie (Becky), this movie contains an insane amount of gore. So if you can't stomach it, don't watch this movie. Consider this a friendly warning. Now, on to the story! Like the first movie, this one is about Becky getting even with the people who wronged her. I won't tell you specifically what the wrongdoings are, but it's bad. Just like in the first movie. Real bad. And Becky is angry now, so get ready to see some blood spilled. Or... splattered, to be precise."", ""Becky 1 was quite fun, this one is absolutely garbage.1, bad guys broke into the house aiming to kill becky, but they killed the old lady instead and didnt do anything to Becky, I mean yes nothing, didn't break her arm or rape her or torture her but kill the old lady and left.2, Becky grapped a bunch of stuff and packed them in her bag, and she didn't even use one item, not 2 not 1 but none!! Why packing all useless stuff?3, all bad guys had to be super dumb to let Becky escape for 4 times, I get the rules, bad guys like to talk before killing anyone, but I have no idea what else they can talk to Becky after the second time, but they somehow did .Anyway, soooooooo bad, really really wasting my time, I prefer to look at the living room floor for 120 minutes rather than Becky 2."", ""This is a movie that when I saw it was coming to the Gateway Film Center, I figured I needed to see the original. I heard good things about it but missed it the year that it came out. This was a horror movie coming to the theater, so I made it a point to support it. I was also curious where they would go with this sequel.Synopsis: two years after she escaped a violent attack on her family, Becky (Lulu Wilson) attempts to rebuild her life in the care of an older woman. But when a group known as the 'Noble Men' break into their home, attack and take her beloved dog, Becky must return to her old way to protect herself.Now what I will say is that synopsis helps fill in the backstory and get us up to speed. The only other thing is that Becky goes to a foster home and escapes into the night with her dog, Diego (Pac Williams). The credits are given to us over cartoons and drawings which also help to fill in other parts. That is until Becky ends up with Elena (Denise Burse). She gave the younger woman a ride and then allowed her to rent a room. They've made an unexpected friendship.Becky trains every day and works at a local diner. It is there that she encounters the group from the synopsis. They're led by Sean (Matt Angel). He brought with him Anthony (Michael Sirow) and DJ (Aaron Dalla Villa). Anthony doesn't fully know what they're doing in town, outside of going to a rally put on by Senator Hernandez (Gabriella Piazza). They're going to protest. Sean is going for more though. Closer to him is DJ, who is a loudmouth. This trio has a run in with Becky, who drops a cup of coffee on Sean. He is irate, for good reason. He also wants to punish her for it.That night, she is awoken by a noise. When she goes to investigate, she is held at gunpoint by DJ. She tries to get free and get help from Diego, but Sean knocks the poor animal out. Anthony doesn't understand what they're doing. Elena steps in to help and this sets events into motion. She is killed, Becky is knocked out and when she comes to, her dog is gone. Becky suits up and looks for these guys, only having the name of Darryl to go on. There are only two in the area and the first is an old woman, played by Jill Larson. The other is out in the middle of nowhere, with the 'Noble Men' flag flying.Becky recons the area. She sees that inside there is the trio she met along with Darryl (Seann William Scott) and Twig (Courtney Gains). Since she is outnumbered and the odds are against her so she needs to set up a plan to isolate and dispatch. It once again helps that her adversaries underestimate her. She also learns something about an item she has been carrying since her last ordeal that gets revealed.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is that a big thing for me is continuity since I'm a story guy. I like where this one picks up from the events of the previous one and it fits. My gripe is that I think we have a different dog. I could be wrong there. If that is the worst issue for a sequel, then I can forgive.Where I'll then go is that it is wild to me that we are building a woman protagonist that is in the vein of Schwarzenegger or Stallone. This isn't the first time we've seen that, but it isn't as common to have someone as young as she is. She was 16 years old in the past, if memory serves, and that makes her 18 here. I don't think she is quite yet, but close enough. Since that ordeal, she trains in the art of survival. It is a bit unbelievable to have something like this happen again. I will say though that she brings it on herself by dumping the coffee on Sean. That comes off as victim blaming. It isn't my intent though. She doesn't put up with anyone's grief and I appreciate that. I do feel that Wilson is great in this role. She embodies it and owns it.Having fleshed out my thoughts on the titular character, let me go over to the villains. This one might bother people in how political it goes. What I like here though is that if this offends you, then you might be the problem. The 'Noble Men' are a spoof of the 'Proud Boys'. This is a group that considered to be terrorists in our fictional world. The commentary here is how deeply they've infiltrated the police and government agencies. What I also like here is that we see normal people getting caught up in it. Anthony is having second thoughts as he doesn't realize what their plan is. The tension is good here with how uncomfortable being in the presence of Darryl and Twig is. I also love it when Becky goes after them, we see their true colors as well. I'll credit here to Sirow, Dalla Villa, Scott, Angel and Gains as our main villains.I'm going to shift over to what I have issues with. A minor one is this happening to Becky again. This won't be something that I knock down my score for. I can even buy another group underestimating her and she gets the best of them. It might have worked better to tie in that first group to this one, but that doesn't hurt it either. This goes a bit too whimsical for me and there feels like plot conveniences. The ending also made me roll my eyes. I'd be fine with seeing another movie and Becky's adventures as she goes into a full Rambo character. I could have done without it though as well.Since I've gone through most of the cast, I'll go into the performances. Larson was funny in her role and how it plays in later. Avoid the Internet Movie Database page as it spoils it. Williams was good as the dog. I would have liked them to utilize him more as it feels like a tease. Other than that, Alison Cimmet, Derek Gaines, John D. Hickman and a cameo by Kate Siegel were solid. They helped round this out for what was needed.All that is left is filmmaking. The first thing is the cinematography. I thought that it was good. We get cool shots. The framing works here. Pulling in the effects, they keep with the comic book motif with graphics on the screen. I do think that they lean into this a bit too much and that comes back to whimsical nature. Again, not enough to ruin things. It just takes me out of it. They also use dream sequences a couple times. It is set up that she has violent fantasies, but I don't know if we need that as it feels cheap. The effects though do go brutal, I love that. The soundtrack also works for what was needed.In conclusion, this is a fun follow up to the original. We get more in the same vein while also developing the character of Becky farther. I think that Wilson does great in this role. The rest of the cast around her is good. There is also relevant commentary that I think will turn people off, but it fits the times. It also makes this movie a time capsule. I like what they do with the effects and the cinematography. I do think the whimsical nature and where this goes in the end makes it a bit farfetched. This is a fun, shut off your brain movie though for sure. I'd recommend this to horror and non-horror fans alike, especially if you are of a certain political persuasion.My Rating: 7 out of 10."", 'The first ""Becky"" isn\'t especially imaginative, but it\'s entertaining enough to spend 1.5 hours when nothing better is on. It has a fun premise, an actual plot, and goofy Kevin James from ""The King of Queens"" fame was surprisingly good as the antagonist. This one is just BAD. So bad, I almost felt sorry for the actors.Unlike the first however, this one is an intentionally over-the-top dark comedy/parody of every clichéd stereotype of a certain \'segment\' of Americans. BUT, it\'s not funny or clever or cute. And with a running time less than 1.5 hours, it doesn\'t even have a chance to set anything up. It\'s over before you know it.', ""It's 2 years after the first movie. Becky (Lulu Wilson) is now 16 and has not done well in foster care. She and her dog Diego do make a friend in Elena and board with her. Becky angers a group of sexist malcontents. They follow her home. They kill Elena and steal Diego. Becky tracks them down to an anti-government group led by Darryl (Seann William Scott).I kinda like the first movie with some reservations. I like Lulu Wilson and her psycho killer eyes. The first movie does benefit from the fun of a little girl killing machine. She's more grown up and the sequel has to grow up a bit. The writing remains an issue. There is no way that those thugs would let Becky live after killing Elena. You never leave a witness to a murder. You kill one. You kill them all. It makes even less sense to steal the dog and leave her behind. I am glad that Becky mentions being bored with guns. Guns would be too easy for her. The spaces between the killings still lag. This franchise is probably going to keep going. The writing needs to be better. It remains an interesting but flawed franchise."", ""I was hesitant to watch this sequel after being underwhelmed with the first movie. But I remember liking the premise, style and tone. So I gave this a shot. And I felt exactly the same. It's mildly enjoyable, but not enough. And there are some really dumb parts.If you liked the first one, I think you'll enjoy the sequel as well. But if you were underwhelmed like me, I doubt this will win you over. (1 viewing, 6/17/2023)SPOILERSThe one dumb part that stands out the most is her first victim. She traps him in a hole and he's yelling at her to get him out. But it's barely deep and he can easily climb out. I guess it's not a huge deal because it doesn't come into play since she has his gun now.In the next scene, he has a grenade taped to his mouth with a string attached to the pin and the front door of the cabin. She knocks and waits for them to open the door which will pull the pin...It's pretty difficult for me to believe how she did all of this, but again, I can let this slide. What I can't let slide is, all he has to do is move forward a few feet and the string wouldn't be able to pull the pin.I'm not sure what she could have done to keep him in place. They didn't show his feet, probably because of how obvious it would be that he can move closer. But even if she somehow tied his feet together AND tied it to a stake in the ground, he could just fall forward so the pin isn't pulled. It's glaringly stupid."", ""This isn't high drama or an epic cinematic experience and you shouldn't expect it to be. There are naturally lots of little gaps in the action as it plays out, which you'd also expect. Becky demonstrates a carefree, nothing to lose attitude that empowers her to ridiculous violence. She is a victim, the hand of retribution and a wild teenager all in one. The story line starts out with promise, showing Becky's talents to convince and fool others into thinking she is a sweet teenager. All the while, having a hidden hunger for violence. The success and weakness of the movie is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. There is just enough of a hint of satire to excuse or accept the bullets from trained opponents that miss her, while she never does. The movie could be a solid 7 or 8 if the story was tightened up and her opponents weren't always quiet so daft."", 'This movie is the perfect metaphor of today\'s young progressive left.

While I enjoyed the film, the director used every bloody cliche in the book. Setting scenes to give the viewers a comparison impression between James Bond, and The Bricklayer. You might almost thinking they were trying to create a ""Brand"" so that there could be future Bricklayer films. Transparent hopes of more, when the film has so many flaws may be doomed to disappointment. Many of the scenes also had actors either posing for the scene, or either looking at the camera, or every other way except at the camera. Some of them near broke their necks avoiding looking at the camera, even when they were in very abnormal postures.

I think my point has been made: stupid title.In his first shootout, he\'s standing up with no cover when two assassins open fire, mostly missing him but he has a wound on his stomach that looks like a bullet hole which he seals with duct tape. Then he\'s in a desperate hand-to-hand battle with one of the assassins who can\'t shoot straight, yet our hero doesn\'t seem to be impeded in the least by the gunshot. In the next scene, he\'s wearing a tight shirt with no evidence of a wound. Maybe he\'s a fast healer.An elevator at a construction site falls to the ground and explodes? What is on or in an elevator that would explode? That was rhetorical because, of course, an elevator wouldn\'t explode but the cretins who wrote this mess just thought it was time for an explosion. You can\'t have too many explosions in a really terrible movie. I always say that if there is more than one explosion in a film\'s trailer, it\'s probably a terrible movie. The trailer for this bomb had four, including the magical exploding elevator.Move forward to the fight scene in the outdoor club and things take a turn for the unbelievable. Multiple attackers, but thankfully they only come at him one at a time so he can punch and hit them with bottles. The worst part of this is that there\'s this epic fight going on and the other people are still dancing. It was just so silly and stupid that had I watched this in a cinema, I would have been laughing uncontrollably. Instead, I was writing about it.

Sadly camera movement felt also a bit rushed.I gave this a 6/10 since its still an original story and Aaron Eckart just, but barely, saves this movie from downfall, would have expected more from this movie especially from the director of Die Hard 2.', ""I don't know what to tell you.

It doesn't add anything to the movie, nobody cares if we have 4 minutes of screen time with a character doing mason work, or tending to bees or what have you. Save those 4 minutes of background and use it on a flash back or training or something.This is just a simple story, and as others have said it's more of a Turdlayer than anything else. Low effort film from the same guy who produced Cutthroat Island paired with a 1st time writer. How is anyone surprised that this isn't anything more than a 1star film?"", ""...this is the kind of movie you will like. I'm not sure why all the bad reviews. There's good action and Aaron Eckhart does his usual good job.

It was different between each one and added to the plot.As someone with some martial arts training, I can tell you the fight sequences are well staged, although I must say that the characters can really take a punch. There are some pretty hard hits in there that would have laid me out most days.A good movie to watch while you are on the treadmill!"", 'Victor Radek (Clifton Collins Jr.), believed dead is murdering anti-CIA journalists in Greece and framing it on the CIA who might want them dead.

The movie is low budget with a lot of fight scenes that are comical. I mean really, do the people who are attacking simply let you punch them and then crack a bottle over their head? In this movie they do. Sure, there are a few nice jiujitsu flips, and it is nicely choreographed, but there are more than needed. And of course the bricklayer's handy dandy trowel is always nearby to stab an assailant. While the location of Thessaloniki is a nice touch and the few scenes where they show the city are probably the highlights of this movie, it still cannot make up for being an awful flick.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was also bizarre to think of what things would be like if nobody looked older than 25. The movie played upon the possibility of multiple generations would look the same age - at least for those rich enough to afford to purchase the additional years. The story was also well thought out in relation to how people would act within the differing classes of society: the rich would take their time and take few risks. The poor would treasure their time, moving quickly, and, with less to lose, would be less risk adverse.Great premise, great start to the movie, decent follow-through.

From what i hear from the director of the movie they took the story, the dialogues as it was in the book but added some stuff and some story that it wasnt in the book. I appreciated it because i still think that if the movie was like the book it will be really boring and uninteresting to see the same thing and add some interest to see it. I enjoyed to see Eva Green, Louis Garrel and Vincent Cassel that i find the performance quite different and interesting to be honest. We see them in other ways that we were used to see them. I enjoyed the story: it have some revelation, surprises, dramatic, love, comedy moments that i really enjoyed and find it interesting to see. It was the part 1 and the end let us want to know what will happen next: about D'Artagnan? Constance(what she saw? And who she saw that we couldnt see?). The fights sequences was quite interesting and the long sequences that we have without a cut reinforced the immersion to live in real time what the characters go trough. I find Eva Green beautiful to be honest and was pretty sensual and good looking on screen. Im waiting for part 2 to see more and im pretty impatient to see that soon."", ""A disappointing movie. Like some others here, I was looking forward to a film which finally does justice to the source material - one of the greatest swashbuckling tales of all time. This, alas, doesn't. There are some very good things. The feel is very authentic. Some of the set pieces eg. The Buckingham ball, the marriage of the King's brother, are stunning. Some of France's best acting talent is on display although I think Cassel and Duris are miscast. They don't do it for me. Matters aren't helped by some of the worst subtitles I've ever seen. Really bad. In summary, worth a watch but nowhere near as exciting as it should have been. It seems we have another part to come. Perhaps they'll hit their stride in that one."", ""Cloak and dagger films are certainly not the hottest trend at the moment, in fact they haven't been for ages. But that doesn't mean that the genre is unappealing, and certainly not this high-quality production. A high budget, an appropriately fantastic set, an authentic look, charismatic actors in the mood to play, a brisk production, likeable or much-hated stereotypes, humour in the right place - all the ingredients are properly mixed here. The interpretation of the novel is very independent, which is certainly the right approach given the abundance of film adaptations already available. And it is European cinema! So support and watch it all, part 2 will follow soon."", 'This adaptation of the classic tale is yet again conflicted as it comes to the good that it brings and the bad that arrives with it. Thus far, I hold the 1970\'s version by Lester as a pinnacle in The Three Musketeers adaptations, and - unfortunately - this latest attempt does not threaten its throne.The negatives included the dark-toned costumes and the overall gritty colour scheme of the entire movie. The King\'s Musketeers, historically consisting of nobility, seemed more like a group of mercenaries who had crawled to work through muddy ditches. And even the richer nobility seemed to prefer dark colours, which is just silly when you consider that bright colours and clean clothes were the main indicators of wealth at the time.Another downside relates to the relationships between the characters: overall, they were mostly taken for granted, assuming that viewers already knew that the three musketeers were close friends, so there was not much need to show it. There are no scenes showing the chemistry between the three musketeers to make them actually feel like friends. Similarly, d\'Artagnan\'s relationship with Constance felt superficial at best - there was no apparent chemistry between the actors.There also seemed to be little left of the musketeers\' honour: in an early fight with the cardinal\'s men, one of the musketeers commits a clear murder.On the positive side, the film showed some daring in slightly reinventing the story - and managed to do it with a fair bit of respect for history: the relationship between the king and his brother was as problematic as it should be, and the conflict between Catholics and Protestants received more visibility than in previous iterations, and it was even part of the plot. These elements lead to new plot twists and elements, but do not (IMHO) take it too far from the original (like some other recent film versions did).Of course, there were some ill-judged costume bits: temple frame spectacles on one character stood out (as they appeared only c. 150 years later), as well as the umbrella to hold off rain.This first part of the two-part film certainly loses to Lester\'s films from the 1970s, but it\'s still a somewhat enjoyable ""dark"" version of the adventure. I\'m teetering between 3/5 and 3.5/5, but - for the moment - I\'ll let it lie at 3/5 (6/10).', ""Acting is good, cinematography is very good and the set is beautiful and realistic. Outfits are great and you do get a good feeling about the time the story is happening.The narrative is a bit broken, they try to go deep in some areas but fail so things remain left like suspended mid air. The main plot is vague and many things happen at the same time, you don't get lost, but it lacks purpose in some way, plus very slow pace it gets boring.I'm not a hard core Dumas fan but I do remember musketeers where young like D' Artagnan and this dude's are old. Didn't bother me but being a book adaptation feels wrong."", 'I never wrote a review, never, but for this film, I felt that I needed it.First, I gave it 6 not because of the cinematography, or because of the costumes, I give it 6 because the story is just nonsense for me. I never read the book, and I have a feeling that he is much better than this film. The pace is just too rushed, I don\'t have breath to understand all of it, and the storyline is very bad to me.

I have seen all the adaptations done mean while. And I must say, this is one of the best.

And very hard to compaire the characters and actors in it. I would say we have seen many powerfull Miladys in time, but Eva Green is one of the best for sure.', ""I've watched every tv show or movie ever made about the Musketeers, and this is the first one I didn't finish. My all time favorite is the BBC series of 2013. I even enjoy the Charlie Sheen Disney movie, and there's a special place in my heart for DiCaprio in the Iron Mask (Jeremy Irons is the best Aramis ever) I prefer my Musketeers lighter, funnier and more adventure oriented than drama like. This new adaptation is rather gritty and dirty. No doubt that the 1600's were not sterilized, but this movie is more like early middle ages than romantic France. Also, maybe the populace lived in dirt and mud, but the King and his guard didn't. The casting of the Musketeers was also rather odd, these guys don't look the part at all, they just seem like regular folk, no charisma or presence. Milady the Winter and Treville are on point.Funny they wanted to preserve or recreate the dirt and grit of war engulfed France of the 1600's but they had to add the 2023 touch to it by making Porthos Bi. Filmmakers, respect the source material. Period."", ""Amazing sets. I take it that they shot at actual locations.However some stuff kept bugging me. How come the musketeers look so dirty. It's a of they never cleaned themselves. And their clothes... somehow I don't think that they will wear like that when they are presented to the king. Just seemed that Richard Lester version was more accurate and managed to capture the essence of the story with the humor to carry the story along.The story was a bit weak and unnecessarily convoluted. I think the sub plot regarding Athos was an unnecessary diversion. Just added some level of confusion by throwing the conflict of the protestants and catholics into the mix. And This story depends a lot on the interaction between the newest member of the musketeers and the others. Which somehow didn't seem to be very well fleshed out. Lester's version showed a lot of camaraderie through interacting with each other. This show stretched their relationship.

I feel like this movie approaches it's themes in a way similar to Blazing Saddles but Blazing Saddles has a lot more slapstick.

Oh my god! One of the most intense films I have watched in a very long time with gripping performances from Hemsworth and Brühl! An extremely clever script from Peter Morgan in which he doesn't pick sides, but instead allows the audience to view these characters in their own light.I am a huge fan of F1 so when viewing a film relating to that sport it would be questionable that there are some anachronisms or minor problems. But no! There was not a single fault with this film, it is the most realistic sports film I have viewed! A film that portrays the rivalry between the British and Austrian world champions and the fateful crash. With some powerful dialogue from Lauda and Hunt.Even if you aren't a fan of F1, the intense action and no-holds adrenaline should keep you entertained from start to finish. With a great sway of emotions from melancholy to ecstatic! This film deserves the acclaimed reviews it has been receiving."", ""Really. His performance in Rush came as a huge surprise. This is his best performance by quite some margin, a role which he plays with a great deal of maturity and respect. He plays Hunt with just the right level of arrogance, cockiness, confidence and audacity to convince you that he was real life 70's playboy James Hunt, a man destined to live fast and die young.Bruhl is superb as Niki too. It's a role that he deserves much recognition for, particularly his accent and mannerisms. Lauda was one of the first of a new generation of professional driver, driving the old playboy characters out of the sport and Bruhl nails this icy determination to succeed magnificently. A particular nod goes to Christian McKay's portrayal as the slightly eccentric, petrol head extraordinaire, ever so aristocratic but hopelessly financially incompetent Lord Hesketh. The camera work is spectacular, none less so than with some very creative angles of the beautifully filmed on track action. The brief in-helmet camera shots are inspired, giving you a glimpse of the drivers world. CGI work will be spotted by the keen eyed, but you have to consider that without it that there are certain scenes involving priceless period machinery (the sound of a Cosworth DFV firing up and filling the cinema was worth the ticket price alone) that would be just impossible to film as accurately as they were depicted here with real machinery. As a result, they are able to use the CGI sparingly and to good effect.The main facts of the 1976 season are on the whole handled very accurately. Certainly, some liberties are taken with poetic licence, but this is still a scripted film and not a documentary. The factually heavy writing of the script along with beautifully filmed and liberal use of period machinery being recorded at pace on real asphalt will be enough to keep the fans of the sport well represented.It's a gripping telling of the 1976 Formula 1 season, which whilst not sharing the same shear spectacle of Howard's other 'too unbelievable to be true' film Apollo 13, Rush tells a story which would be just too unbelievable in terms of human bravery and personal destiny for any fictional story to be given credence. It's a tale which will be enough to hold the unfamiliar or casual viewer's attention with a steel firm grip to see how the different personalities handle the pressures of life both on and off the track and how rising to the top takes it's tole on these two polar opposite real life gladiators of the race track.With the lead actors clearly committed to giving their best performances yet and a tastefully handled script, Ron Howard delivers a visually impressive account of events that may well become one of his most respected directorial efforts yet.10/10"", ""What a breath of fresh air... A brilliant film in every respect. I was lucky enough to this movie at a special preview and I cant tell you how great a film this is... At first you think its about racing cars, but its not it really does give you an insight into the human condition...The rivalry between Hunt and Lauder is just played brilliantly... The race sequences are superb, really taking you back to the 70s... The heyday of this awesome sport. It shows the end of an era where the gentlemen drivers begin to give way to professional sportsmen and the end (in my opinion) of the excitement of the sport. It shows what a pale reflection today's F1 is of this once great sport, and what great characters we have lost...A real must see movie"", ""It's kind of a slow starter but actually gets better and better. If the first hour of the movie would have been better it would most definitely be a solid 8 for me.Daniel Brühl is so good in this one!"", 'A super cool movie Beautiful story and wonderful acting main actors', 'On of the best Grand Prix movies ever made.RUSH is a testosterone race fest. Ron Howard deserves credit for taking a redundant series of races and making them interesting and watchable. Good performances all around. The movie is elevated by an outstanding Hans Zimmer score. Excellent cinematography and ear pounding sound of engines put the viewer in the action.The hospital scenes are a bit tough for the faint of heart.

Caps entire goal is to do more and help in anyway he can which to me makes him the ideal superhero.Red Skull in this wasn't all that interesting to me. He just seems like your regular old run of the mill villain. Hugo Weaving did do a great job as the Red Skull but the character himself wasn't all that good.Hayley Atwell is great and has a very good relationship with Chris Evans as Captain America. She is a huge part of why the movie ending was emotional. Bucky played by Sebastian Stan is great and also has a very nice on screen dynamic with Chris Evans.During the middle act of this movie we got a lot of montages and then we had one action scene. I really enjoy the action scenes in this but I do feel that having montages and one action scene be your middle act is very weak storytelling.Overall Captain America The First Avenger is a good movie. It gives some fun scenes with great characters, but the structure of the movie and the villain needed to be thought out a little more for the movie to be considered great.7.5/10."", 'Really? First of all, the whole Nazi alternative history theme should be retired. Second, I love Marvel comics, read them as a boy, many of them. I liked them. So I understand the initial urge to accept yet another movie bringing up the Marvel super heroes. Ever since Stan Lee decided to retire and count his money, the franchise has declined into mere commercialism. Sometimes the same old tricks, and the tired chase scenes and the over-worked dangling from peril scenes can only be stretched so far...in this film it is to far. After watching the film I could not tell you what is was about, it is completely forgettable. I cannot recall a single interesting moment beyond my surprise to see that Tommy Lee Jones is in the film. I had no idea he was. Really, I am astonished at the overall high rating of this piece of trash. Is the attention span of the movie-going public so in decline? That such a poor film could be so well rated is mysterious to me and would make a more interesting subject for a movie than this film was.', ""Shows the best representation of Steve Rodgers and Bucky, but I'm really disappointed in MCU Red Skull, I don't like Red Skull that much but comic Red Skull is better than this. If they improved Red Skull, maybe this would've been a 10."", 'I loved this movie. Captain America has had 3 movies in the past, not counting some 1940s ones which can be excused for being good, that were so awful they make movies like Steel or Green Lantern look good. However, I saw a lot of critiques for this movie that were negative. Now I understand differing opinions and all, but they all followed a formula and each one seemed like griping to the point it was just getting stupid. If you\'ll indulge me here, I have a list of the repeated ones and a rebuttal to each.1. The technology for WWII is too far advanced! This one was the most common and the stupidest in my opinion. It\'s called ""Fiction"", as in ""not real"". Every time I heard this one it made me think these people have no suspension of disbelief and would complain that Iron Man is a terrible movie because the technology to build a flying robot suit doesn\'t exist yet. People, it\'s comic books and it\'s in a fictional WWII setting. It\'s allowed to take liberties.2. Captain America is too invincible! That was just stupid. Captain America is relatively weak compared to many other superheroes, he\'s just a perfect example of a human being brought about by the experiments in the film. Also, he\'s the main character. He\'s not supposed to die in a movie that is leading him up to be in a tie-in to all the other recent Marvel films that will lead to The Avengers.3. Red Skull is a terrible villain.There is no sense to this one. He\'s supposed to be the guy that\'s worse than Hitler and can get just as many people on his side to do his bidding. On top of that he can take Cap in a fight fairly evenly. Saying he\'s a bad villain is baseless.4. Steve doesn\'t go through a character arc/get any back-story.For one, he really doesn\'t need to. Steve was a good guy from the start, and he did go through an arc. It was subtle, but he did. He gained more confidence and become the soldier he is. He has a back-story but it\'s weaved in throughout. We know he was bullied a lot, we know he he is from a military family, we know he grew up with Bucky, we know he has had very few, if any, dates in his life, he\'s a childhood friend of Bucky, and we know he wants to be a soldier because he feels its his duty. I\'d rather get it weaved in through the narrative of the story rather than get a huge text dump or just have characters talking for half an hour about everything they\'ve ever done.5. This movie just glorifies America! Not really. It\'s a good vs. evil story that happens to have a character named Captain America, which was given to him by a publicity stunt. I suppose you also hate movies like Saving Private Ryan because it tells things from the perspective of American soldiers but not the Japanese ones? These were the most common arguments and they are easily refutable. Captain America is a great movie, showcasing one of the best Marvel has to offer and should be in the 7s or higher, not the 6s.', 'As there\'s something about the the 1930s-1940s that appeals to me, I tend to prefer movies set in the era and made in its cinematic style. And being fond of the adventure genre, I anticipate movies like the Indiana Jones trilogy, ""The Rocketeer"", ""Sky Captain And the World of Tomorrow"", ""The Mummy"" (1999) and, of course, ""Captain America"".When I first heard about this movie, my expectations soared. The director was Joe Johnston, who made my favorite superhero movie, ""The Rocketeer"". It was set during WWII, made in a 1940s style, and scored by Alan Silvestri. Alas, my heart sank after I found out that they were going to do the whole frozen alive storyline I\'ve always hated. But, I reasoned, the only reason they are making it is because of ""The Avengers"". Without that storyline, they wouldn\'t even be making it. Beggars can\'t be choosers.Well, after two years of waiting, I got to see the movie. And to my surprise, it surpassed my high expectations. I didn\'t even hate the ending, although I would have much preferred a happier one more in line with the original 1940s comics (in which Cap stays in his own era, then fights commies in the 1950s). So, here are my thoughts on the movie.Acting.Chris Evans was great as Captain America. He nailed the character. After watching him as Captain America, I can\'t see anyone else in the role. The special effects performed on him to make him look skinny for the first part of the movie were absolutely seamless. If I hadn\'t known about them, I wouldn\'t have been able to tell they were there. But those effects would not have looked nearly so great if it had not been for Evans convincingly ""acting skinny"". No matter what condition Steve Rogers is in, shrimp or super soldier, Chris Evans portrayed him flawlessly.It was refreshing to see a non-angsty, pure-hearted hero for the first time in a while. Instead of portraying Cap with irony or satire, they took him seriously, and it really payed off. Cap, despite (or because of) his delightful simplicity and earnestness, comes across as incredibly deep and human, proving once again that the notion of the old-fashioned hero being inferior to his modern antihero counterpart is merely a haughty assumption.Hugo Weaving\'s Red Skull was effectively menacing, darkly humorous, and overall deliciously like an old-fashioned serial villain. Haley Atwell was charming, feisty and classically beautiful as Peggy Carter. Stanley Tucci\'s Dr. Erskine was played to perfection, Tommy Lee Jones was a scene-stealer of the highest order, Toby Jones was very memorable as a sympathetic, almost lovable Arnim Zola, Richard Armitage was effectively despicable, Dominic Cooper was good as Howard Stark, and Neal McDonough made his presence known despite very little screen time. Sebastion Stan was also quite good as Bucky, although he wasn\'t quite as memorable as many of the others.Visuals and Action.My feelings on the visuals are mixed. I was hoping for a bit more of a photo-realistic feel, but it instead looks a bit too much like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" (a movie whose visuals I like very much, but would prefer to be a novelty, not the norm). That said, the use of wide lenses did help make it look more real than many other movies with such massive amounts of CGI. The color in many scenes is quite good, or at least by today\'s standards. I did dislike the muted color used in some of the winter scenes, though. I wish they had gone for more of a Technicolor look, but I\'m pretty satisfied with the look of the movie, except for the winter scenes.I didn\'t like the action montage too much, as it had some slow-motion effects, as well as giving off a feeling that you\'re being cheated out of some scenes. I also thought that the motorcycle-chase felt somewhat rushed. Other than that, however, I did like most of the action scenes. The Kruger chase, Cap\'s first mission, and the final fight with Red Skull were standouts.I would have preferred that the HYDRA soldiers\' uniforms look a bit more Nazi-like, but the look they have works well. Red Skull doesn\'t care about them as individuals. He is the Hydra, and they are merely his many identical heads. Thus, their faceless, almost robotic look works very well. Music.Silvestri\'s score is the best superhero score in years. His main theme unfortunately doesn\'t have the ""flow"" that some of his better works do, and seems a little clunky at first. But after you hear it a few times, it grows on you. It\'s now stuck in my head. Overall, Silvestri\'s score hits all the right notes, and captures menace, adventure, and every other mood required of it, while having actual themes. Media Ventures, eat your collective heart out.Writing.The humor was great throughout. The levels of ""heart"" were set to maximum. The romance, although sparse, was memorable. Everything was portrayed swiftly, without padding, The plot was very well thought out. Memorable lines and scenes abound. Overall, the writing was excellent. Some things that I particularly liked were Steve\'s journey from shrimp to super-soldier, the USO scene, Cap\'s first mission, the role-reversal with Bucky, and the romance. I also liked how Red Skull was his own boss. It gave him more menace. Plus, using HYDRA ironically makes it feel more historically accurate. Having Captain America defeat the Nazis would mess with history too much, and having him lose to them just wouldn\'t do. All I really disliked were Bucky\'s death and Captain America getting frozen alive. That could work well in some movies, but a 1940s-style adventure of this sort just cries out for a happy ending. Plus, the modern-day bookends detract from the overall atmosphere. Still, the final scenes were poignant, although out-of-place.9/10.', 'Yes, another high-production, superhero movie invades the theatres. Should you watch it?Captain America: The First Avenger is an action-adventure movie that shows us the transformation of one Steve Rogers from a scrawny but patriotic man during World War II to Captain America, the star-spangled icon of freedom. Equipped with the Super-Soldier serum and his desire to do good, he finds the strength to combat Hydra, a Nazi offshoot, and its deranged leader, Johann Schmidt.To a great extent, the First Avenger succeeds in translating the essence of its title character to the big screen. Captain America is portrayed as a humble guy who just wants to serve his country, so much so that he goes to great lengths to do it. Although there are minor changes to his comic book origin, who Captain America is is preserved. Steve Rogers may have said that he\'s ""just a kid from Brooklyn,"" but he is definitely so much more than that. He is the hero whom people look up to, and whom superheroes aspire to be. Captain America may not have the coolest powers but is relatable in so many levels.It is becoming a trend in movies today to have a complicated plot in order to tell a good story. However, the First Avenger\'s approach, which centers on Captain America fighting the good fight, is pretty straightforward. The film proves that you don\'t need gazillion mind-boggling things to tell an inspiring tale of an extraordinary soldier on the frontlines. Being a superhero movie set in a war zone, it offers a healthy dose of action and involves Captain America bashing enemy heads and throwing his signature shield more times than you can count. Scenes of romance and humor help the film to become balanced and entertaining to watch. Steve is also a nice break from the morally conflicted heroes we usually encounter. He is simply someone who is moved to do what is right—nothing more, nothing less.Aside from the excellent character development and story progression, the film also boasts a solid cast. I honestly had doubts about Chris Evans playing the captain because he was such a fit for the cocky yet strong-willed Johnny Storm aka the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies, but he gives a convincing performance. Hugo Weaving as the menace Red Skull doesn\'t disappoint either, although we are still sure to remember him best as Agent Smith in the Matrix trilogy. Hayley Atwell\'s portrayal of Peggy Carter has a sense of both hardiness and elegance which makes the character easy to love. As someone who consistently follows Captain America\'s exploits in comic books, my admiration for the character has increased even more because of the First Avenger. The film gives fans everywhere a good show. I especially liked that they were able to incorporate the printing of a Captain America comic book in a world where he really exists. The punching of ""Hitler"" in the face never gets old!During the course of Captain America: The First Avenger, viewers are shown how to be a patriot through Cap\'s positive demeanor and outlook. In the end, we come to realize that the film deals with fighting for the things we love – freedom, country, friend and even one\'s own potential to do great things. The ending of the film may have been a bit abrupt, but it definitely points to a sequel. In this case, The Avengers (2012) is just around the corner, and it is something that we should watch if we want more of our Captain America.Yes, another high-production, superhero movie invades the theatres. Should you watch it?Of course. There is no other option.', 'I had been looking forward to Captain America for about a year, and I decided to make it the first premiere I\'d go to all summer. I got a group of ten friends and showed up hours early with Captain America merchandise and enough caffeine to stay up through Lord of the Rings in its entirety.What happened?Every single person in my group was disappointed. Needless to say, we still enjoyed ourselves, and I wasn\'t even expecting much, (Jumanji and Jurassic Park III at the top of the director\'s credentials), but, man, I couldn\'t help counting the flaws throughout the film.Positive: Chris Evans was surprisingly convincing. Also, our hero was truly inspirational (if not corny). The sets were nice, and the other stars filled their roles well. I was well entertained, and the first half flowed nicely.Negative: Oh, lord. I\'ll try not to nitpick. Most glaring was the absolute pathetic villain. Hugo Weaving (a great actor who manages to give his character some, well, character) plays a downright cheesy, sappy, crazy, and so un-menacing-its-not-even-funny chum nicknamed Red Skull. His back story is never laid out and only hinted at a few times, his followers are faceless drones with advanced weaponry but the brains and aim of stormtroopers, and his intentions are ridiculously stupid and unexplainable (his target is ""everything""? Oh, please). He was never threatening and never endangered our hero, not to mention his death was as anti-climatic as they come (Voldemort, anyone?)Also obvious is the cliché invincibility of the Captain. He leaps twenty feet as flames engulf him, he fistfights scores of goons, blows up crap all over the place, and never once gets seriously injured. Suspense? Apparently, there\'s no need when you have patriotism!The technology was just plain silly for its era. Leaving out the cheesy blue-shooting things (something to do with the gods? I don\'t know, it was kind of weird), there are spycraft, tanks the size of mansions, helicopters that look like spacecraft, single-person submarines, and (my personal favorite) manned bombers in the shape of bombs. Are they suicide bombers? Apparently.There is no attachment to the characters (anyone blink when his best friend died?), there are loads of forgettable scenes (notably the war montage of which the trailer consists, which might have made a good movie, I might add), and clichés (love interest walks in on random kiss, etc.) and downright sloppy pacing galore.I must stop here, but seriously, 8.0? Not even close. Enjoyable fare, but nothing to think twice about. Here\'s to hoping Joss Whedon improves upon Chris Evan\'s Captain in 2012.', 'Hard to believe that just three years ago (2008), Marvel made the bold decision to create a single movie universe out of their second-tier heroes (though some may argue that Iron Man is first-tier";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"[""Puss and Boots the last wish is a fantastic sequel and inarguably better than the charming first outing. The animation is brilliant, characters are charming, pacing is tight, very funny and the action is excellent. Not to mention there is a ton of heart. If I were to nitpick I think one of the antagonists trumps the other. One is played for more comedic purposes while the other is an Intimidating physical presence for boots to contend with. The Last Wish has something for everyone and it's probably one of the better animated movies I've seen in sometime. I really don't want to get into the story to avoid spoilers because the movie was a lot of fun, and it's best to go into it fresh. If anyone is considering taking their family to see the Last Wish like I did then The Last Wish is an easy recommendation. 100% worth the money. Two thumbs up for team friendship."", ""CS Lewis once said a children's story that only appeals to children is not a good children's film in the least. I can think of plenty of crummy kids' movies that illustrate the point, but I'd rather bring up a positive example-- PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH.I cannot believe I am saying this about a Shrek spinoff, but this movie really is that good. It works on so many levels: as a high-speed comedy, all the jokes land, but as a story about mortality and the meaning of life, this film is oddly compelling and mature. The plot literally involves Puss running from the personification of death, hoping to cling to his life. In between the funny scenes, I was actually moved by the existential crisis of this cartoon cat. That's no small feat.This is truly a movie kids and adults can cherish."", ""I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.I adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year."", 'This is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. I hope it gets real recognition and people don\'t dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".I\'ve always liked DreamWorks films, with my favorite being How to Train Your Dragon 2, but after rewatching the first Puss in Boots movie, I wasn\'t expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. I like the first installment for sure but it\'s certainly a lot simpler in story than I\'d prefer. This one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that I truly felt something during it.There were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. I think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. And that\'s a message that every person of any age can get something out of. The voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. This is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and I dug it all the way through.There\'s really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that\'s it. I loved it and I\'ll rewatch it as soon as it releases on VOD.', 'The last ""Puss In Boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""Shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn\'t make something really great again, right? The story is pretty standard, as Puss In Boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. It seriously has some of the best action I\'ve seen in a long time. I don\'t even think this film qualifies as a comedy. It really is more like a straightforward action flick. Even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from Frame 1 to Frame...whatever.This film does not take place before the Shrek films. We get to see some brief flashbacks with Shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. The villains are Big Jack Horner, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and a wolf. I believe a poster called this character the Big Bad Wolf, but he isn\'t that, even if he\'s technically based on him (he\'s actually DEATH). Every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. Every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.So...who does get the wish in the end? Nobody! Everyone (except Big Jack Horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. It even begins with another sequel hook with Puss In Boots going back to Far Far Away Land. Another Shrek/Puss In Boots movie? If it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best CGI of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****', '""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a film whose animation is excellent, full of colorful and detailed scenes, but its script becomes tired in some scenes and even predictable, although its positive message on issues of personal relationships stands out. The characters are fun, highlighting Goldilocks and the three bears. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek manage to entertain by lending their voices to the protagonists. Puss in Boots is a fun character but his story lacks more irreverence like in ""Shrek"". The soundtrack perfectly recreates the essence of a fairy tale. ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a visual delight with a passable script that could have been better.', ""FYI, surprisingly, kids understood jokes aimed at adults. Yes, there are spots of the movies where it's hard to know what they understand because ideas aim at us adults. But, I think the kids still understood it enjoyed the deeper parts.Personally, the movie was very fitting. Like Puss, I'm also trying to find out who I am and who I want to be in life. This was our journey.The stories have great connections romantically, between rivals and newcomers. The stories are about bringing all of us together despite what happened in the past. The stories come together about building a better future for ALL OF US. Let go of selfish wants and desires, focus on OTHERS and let's work together for a better future!"", ""I wanted to love this movie, but there's not much to love. They throw in an annoying Olaf ripoff who brings nothing to the film. Donkey was at least voiced by a comedian and while I love Harvey Guillen, this wasn't the role for him (or probably anyone honestly).The villain is pretty cool, though he has one standout scene and is then reduced to a background chatter showing up every 20 minutes to remind you he exists. They muddy the water with 2 other groups of villains, one of which is just evil for the sake of being evil.All in all, it's fine. It's no Shrek 2, but perhaps those standards are too high to hold this up to."", ""The overwhelming positive reviews tell me one of three things: 1) There is a secret, better version of this film that I didn't watch, 2) Dreamworks paid for hundreds of bot reviews, or 3) most people's bar for American animated films is so low it might as well be in the ground. Suffice it to say, this movie absolutely did not live up to the hype. Puss in Boots 2 is not only NOT as amazing as everyone is saying it is, is actually a pretty bad movie. Mediocre at best. If you love animated movies then go watch one of the movies that made you fall in the love with the medium again. This movie does not deserve your money. Watched on December 27, 2022."", 'Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. After his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. When he woke up, Puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. At first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking Wolf (Wagner Moura) made Puss decide to retire from adventures.While living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, Puss learned about a Wishing Star from the family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) who were looking for it. Puss decided to search for the Star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. Along with Puss on his quest were his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (Harvey Guillen).This sequel to the first ""Puss in Boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. There is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. On top of the 3D computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2D artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""The Bad Guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the Wolf, and even in Puss during their showdown fight scenes.The voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. Antonio Banderas\'s voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of Puss, whom we\'ve known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""Shrek 2"" (2004). Selma Hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief Kitty Softpaws, who held a grudge against Puss. Florence Pugh\'s characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in Goldilocks\'s voice.Like before, the characters Puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. The choice for main antagonist was Jack Horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. He was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. There were a trove of Disney character references you\'ll have fun identifying, from Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland and Jiminy Cricket.Very notable in this latest Dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. Only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a Dreamworks animated film. The language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. As the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the Wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.PS: The new DreamWorks Animation opening logo precedes this film. It was quite nostalgic to see the DreamWorks boy seeing famous DreamWorks characters old an new -- like Toothless, Po, Boss Baby, a Troll, the Bad Guys and of course, Shrek with Fiona and Donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place.', 'Wow ! Dreamsworks has always been good with sequels and I think it is safe to say this might be their best sequel to date .Without giving much of the plot there are many new characters and fairy tales introduced here and they actually help elevate the story alongside with being so cute ,loveable and hilarious .Appealing to both kids and adults ,this movie was a treat ,it mixes being a fun continuation to the story without repeating the same tropes of the first movie and also handles heavy topics without feeling grim ,dark or taking itself too seriously.Highly recommended and worth every penny 👌', 'I\'m a 37 year old male with no kids and I loved this movie. I\'ve never seen any other puss in boots movie (never thought I would either) but the reviews of this movie intrigued me enough to check it out.If you like ""How to train your dragon"" you\'ll enjoy this too. It\'s a fun, engaging and enjoyable feel good movie with a great message. Loved all the characters from popular fairy tales being the cast in this film. It was funny, engaging, light and serious enough to make a grown man come here and write this review.Good movie. Never thought I\'d watch this as an adult let alone be reviewing it.', ""I can't say I expected this from a Puss in Boots sequel 12 years later. The Last Wish is a true standout feature of 2022 and one of the best animated films in some time.The new art style, clearly inspired by Spider-Verse, feels right at home in this world. I love how it blended the typical CGI look with the new, more hand-drawn style. That combined with some top notch humor and an incredibly emotional story makes this a terrific watch. The film is very singularly focused on Puss's arc, leading to some very satisfying story beats. I had a wonderful time watching this movie and I can't recommend it enough."", ""I'm not sure why this people look at this movie as a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, it's a good, solid movie but I don't think it's anything spectacular. The animation is really nice to look at, and fights are fluid and intense. The character designs are well made, the music is good, and the storyline is decent. The jokes are also on point most the time so overall, I don't see anything the movie did bad. That being said, I also don't see anything the movie did exceptionally well over any other animated movies I've seen. The story isn't groundbreaking or anything, and while the fights (especially puss vs death) are really entertaining to watch, I do think this movie is a little generic at times. I do recommend watching this movie, but I feel if you go in with expectations for this being a 9/10 or 10/10 movie, you might come out feeling a little disappointed. It's good, really good, but not amazing."", ""Seems that these days all the animated kids movies are more or less the same, with very few exceptions in recent years and it's grown tiresome. It's always potty humor and/or a weak storyline that either has adults rolling their eyes or falling asleep. This is one of the exceptions.With pitch perfect voice acting from all parts of the cast, to the way it makes old story concepts feel relatively fresh and funny again, this one is a winner. Best of all was the film doesn't rely on low brow, toilet humor to sell it's laughs. My favorite of which came from a certain play on Jiminy Cricket that I'm sure will have you in stitches.The animation had me a bit underwhelmed which is why I deduct a star, but that is subjective, so I leave that bit up to the viewer to decide for themselves. For me, when the action gets going, it felt glitchy and incomplete, but some people might enjoy that style.Overall, I highly recommend this one when it releases later this month. It's definitely a film that both kids and parents will find entertaining and enjoyable. I know I enjoyed it.4.5 retired heros out of 5."", ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is pretty much perfect. It has good animation, good story, and it's funny how it's just a bunch of fairytales put into one. One of the only problems is, it's not very compelling compared to similar movies like the Shrek franchise, and the Spider Verse trilogy. Another problem is, I don't know what age this is targeted at, because it's a typical cringey kids movie, but it also has a lot of dark themes, and my final problem is how they kept on changing the animation. It was 3d animated, but then the action scenes were comic book style. PLEASE JUST STICK TO ONE ANIMATION STYLE. It just wasn't for me, but I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy it."", ""I was not at all interested in watching this film. As most of the animated movies from the major studios, especially from DreamWorks have been extremely dull and very samey. I can't think of a good one that I've seen since How To Train Your Dragon 2.But then I read all of the brilliant reviews and decided to give this one a go. And to my surprise, it was definitely a welcome change.Puss gets an existential crises when Death (AKA the Big Bad Wolf) comes for his last life after Puss has frivolously wasted his 8 other ones. It's interesting how dark it gets in these scenes, with Puss, who has never been afraid of death, gets scared and has a wakeup call. And learns to value life and the lives of others a bit more.Although it doesn't go as far as I thought it would when it came to heavy themes and character development, it certainly reminded me of the good old days of DreamWorks animation. So I absolutely consider this film a step in the right direction for this studio."", 'The first Puss & Boots was good, but this movie was just ""okay"" and nothing more.Puss is on his last of 9 lives and journeys to a fallin star to wish for more lives.The animation is subpar compared to the first movie, and the dialog is very bland when compared to the first movie as well.Some jokes land but most of them don\'t. I\'m not sure where all these high ratings are coming from? They must have budgeted for the purchasing of bot votes.The last third of the movie seemed way to scary for most kids. I\'m surprised it got a pg rating. The ending was very dark and scary for most young viewers.Anyways, this movie is watchable, but just barely.

Goff, Thelma Lee, Stratton Leopold;They influence our decisions without us knowing it. They numb our senses without us feeling it. They control our lives without us realizing it. They live.;"['They Live is an example of a perfect B-movie, perhaps my personal favourite B-grade film of all time (with perhaps the exception of 1978\'s Dawn of the Dead, although I like to think of that as more a ""B+"" movie). Make no mistake though- this doesn\'t mean I think it\'s a perfect film- it has its flaws, quite a few actually, but all are acceptable in the context of a low-budget B-movie.The basic plot is absurd, so please excuse the probably awkward explanation of it: They Live is about a homeless man named George Nada (played surprisingly well by Roddy Piper- a wrestler), who wanders around Los Angeles looking for work and trying to get by in life. One day he comes across a pair of sunglasses that allow him to see that the whole world has apparently been blind to the fact that aliens have taken over the Earth and are controlling the entire human population through subliminal messages. While wearing the glasses, Nada can directly see the subliminal messages behind billboards lining the streets of LA- they literally read phrases like ""NO INDIVIDUAL THOUGHT"" and ""OBEY"" when seen through the glasses. Furthermore, the glasses allow Nada to see beyond the disguises the aliens wear- without viewing them through the glasses, the aliens look identical to humans.Once Nada acquires the glasses, he makes it a personal mission of his to shut down the TV station where the aliens are broadcasting much of their controlling messages from- he also finds out that destroying this station will allow all humans to see directly through the disguises of the alien invaders. Oh, and along the way he kills a bunch of aliens with a carefree attitude that many action heroes of the 80s possessed. And it\'s a heap of fun to watch him do so.If the plot sounds a little silly, it\'s because it is, but thankfully the film never takes itself too seriously, with its metaphorical tongue being almost constantly planted in its metaphorical cheek. That being said, there is an element of satire to the film which keeps it from being just a mindlessly over-the-top 80s action flick, with clear parallels being made between how the aliens in the film control the population and how the media in real life often wield controlling power over the masses. It\'s interesting to think about such things briefly, and it\'s kind of cool that there is a message in the film to ponder, but it\'s not the film\'s main focus, and therefore it never feels preachy. It\'s a little like Romero\'s Dawn of the Dead in that regard- that film created a parallel between the mindless hordes of zombies and the mindless hordes of individuals who flock to shopping centres, but it never really got in the way of the sense of fun that the film so gleefully possessed. There\'s some sharp social satire in both films, but never to an overwhelming or unnecessarily pervasive extent.I would love to go into some of my favourite specific scenes, but the bulk of them happen in the second half of the film, and as I found the movie to be refreshingly unpredictable, I\'d rather refrain from giving away too many details. I will just say that the first third of the movie is a little slow-going- Nada doesn\'t find the glasses until about half an hour in, but once he does, the film really picks up, and barely loses any steam on the way to a surprisingly poignant yet hilarious finale.This film is quite well-known for two reasons- the first is its famous line said by Nada about chewing bubblegum and kicking ass, which was referenced in Duke Nukem 3D. It\'s perhaps more famous now for being said by Duke Nukem, which is a shame, but the line itself without a doubt originated from They Live. The other reason is a one-vs-one fight scene between two characters that happens about halfway through the film which goes on for a stupendously long time- probably too long, but then again its the scene\'s monumental length that makes it so memorable. The scene is so drawn-out it keeps on flip-flopping between being hilarious and tedious, yet it remains so fascinating to watch because of how openly excessive it is.As I said though, the movie has its problems. The pacing\'s not great, being that the first 1/3 of the movie is pretty damn uneventful. The music gets a little repetitive too- John Carpenter wrote a decent enough score for the film, but he only seemed to write about 2 minutes worth of actual music, so the same theme gets repeated a lot. The film has an incredibly low budget too, and it\'s pretty clear throughout, but your mileage may vary on whether that\'s a truly bad- I kind of think it adds to the movie\'s charm, and therefore works in its favour. Surprisingly though, I don\'t have too many bad things to say about the acting. I was expecting a cringe-inducing performance from wrestler from Roddy Piper in the lead (LEAD!) role, but he\'s surprisingly good, and works well with the material he was given. Keith David is good as always, even if he is sort of the ""black sidekick"" (at least for part of the film). With this performance, Keith David continues to prove that he\'s one of the best actor\'s barely anyone knows the name of. The acting from the two leads in this film really is much better than you\'d expect, even if it\'s not Oscar-worthy material or anything.So yeah, I guess I did link this movie to Citizen Kane in the headline. Citizen Kane is almost as perfectly made as any film can be- you don\'t necessarily have to find it entertaining to acknowledge that. On a purely objective level, it pretty much is a masterpiece of film-making (although I always wished it had a more memorable/ iconic score- seriously, no one can hum the ""theme"" from Citizen Kane). Many people much smarter than myself have written countless words on why Citizen Kane works- see pretty much anything Roger Ebert wrote about that film if you want an idea of why the movie is so highly regarded. Citizen Kane is definitely an ""A-film,"" while They Live is a B-movie. It\'s nowhere near a perfect movie, but when you take into account its limitations- low budget, non-high profile actors, a smaller filmmaking crew- it\'s pretty fantastic. Incredibly entertaining, hilarious, unpredictable, and featuring some surprisingly good social commentary, They Live is an under-rated gem that you should seek out and watch, whether you\'re a B-movie fan or not.', ""I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs n enjoyed the film as an action entertainer. Read about the underlying themes as years passed on but revisited it today. This movie is very relevant for today's time too n it is still very entertaining. The alley fight scene stayed with me since the late 80s. Roddy Piper n Keith David gave memorable performances."", 'I had the pleasure of catching a midnight screening of this last night at the Dundee Theater. Though not a true classic, They Live is an engaging Orwellian-type urban thriller. Rowdy Roddy Piper (in a surprisingly effective performance) plays an unnamed drifter who finds a low level construction job and takes up residence in some type of squatter\'s camp near downtown L.A.. Things look like they still look in most U.S. cities today. The poor are desperate, and the rich seem to keep getting richer. But it seems that some of the residents of this camp are using the church across the street as a kind of a resistance center. But resistance to what? After putting on a pair of special sunglasses he finds at the church, Piper learns a terrifying secret. The well to do are actually aliens whose identities are revealed by the glasses. All sources of media are also subliminally ordering people to consume, obey, and procreate. Small drone aircraft buzz overhead to keep watch on things. The aliens seem to have people totally under their spell. When Piper tips his hand at his ability to see the aliens for what they are, he becomes a hunted man. Can he stay alive long enough to help the resistance expose the entire alien scheme? Who can he trust, if anyone?They Live has too many serious over and undertones for it to be simply dismissed as a low budget exploitation flick. Still it relies heavily on old fashioned shootouts and ass whipping to get its point across. There is nothing subtle about it, despite its low-key first act. Piper is about as subtle as a cinder block thrown through a stained-glass window. At one point, he and Keith David have a long fight that seemed to be like a choreographed Wrestle Mania encounter. It brought plenty of guffaws from the audience. The conclusion is awfully abrupt, too. But this is still a solid and diverting picture, and as timely as ever. In this country, the gap between rich and poor is ever-widening. And people seem less inclined than ever before to ""put on the glasses"" and take a hard look at things. What are they afraid they might see? 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.', ""They Live. Where to begin? Yes, it is goofy. Yes the production value is very low. Yes the action is standard. The guns never empty.

Sorry to disapoint you, but they haven't.\nRowdy Roddy Piper puts on some sunglasses. The world changes. Billboards now say Obey or Sleep. Or Marry and Reproduce.

My friends and I quoted this film for weeks on end with the Bubble gum and kicking @$$ line being a favourite among all. The only real complaint that I have about the film is that the aliens when finally revealed are far too human. They basically look like a skeleton with bug eyes. Not a whole lot of energy seemed to go into their design. While They Live will never be remembered as a film that redefined the way films were made, it still to this day holds a place in my heart as one of the films that just defines your youth. It is fun, action packed and has just enough cool storyline to keep you interested from start to finish."", ""There's a world that is hidden and unseen, that manipulates although it's all been screened, imperceptibly subtle, will direct your every shuffle, it's a greedy and insatiable machine.

The acting is amazing and it's nice to see Ben Affleck in an unusual role, which he really nails.Ridley Scott delivers again."", 'The basic motif to admire this film is the image of Dariusz Wolski. Earth colors, falls and early springs, winter and tones of browns and gray.The second is the acting and the most impressive work seems be by Jodie Comer.Not the last - the force of gifts and precision of Ridley Scott to propose a beautiful exploration of contemporary problems.It is an impressive film for themes and for dialogues , for confrontations and fight scenes and for the wake up of truths. A Medieval story very modern in its fundamental traits. A chain of confirmations about actors talent, an admirable construction of the motives, reactions and answers of characters.Short, a great film and proof of a provocative art of unique director.', 'For the past 2 decades Ridley Scott has been very hit or miss for me. My expectations have therefore become modest, but ""The Last Duel"" was a welcoming surprise.I think the choice of using a ""Rashamon-ish"" narrative was a refreshing way to tell this story. Furthermore, I want to give praise to the editor Claire Simpson, who I will argue made the right choice to trim the scenes that are repeated - reducing the runtime to 155 minutes (which I find to be a long but fitting runtime for this story). I find it very fitting that the individual story lines end at the trial where people disagree on what is true while the audience (to some degree) knows.Despite being refreshingly different and throughly entertaining, there were a few elements that took me out of the film. Firstly, the story is set in France but is told in English. If the names of people and places had been changed this would not had bothered me at all. Secondly, I found the make-up/costumes peculiar in many instances (especially Ben Affleck) while the actors were still very easy to recognize. If this was fantasy, I wouldn\'t have an issue with this. But since this is based on an actual event I would have preferred to see less eye-catching make-up/costumes.For the 2022 Oscar\'s I am surprised there was much more campaign for Ridley Scott\'s other film ""House of Gucci"" (which I would rate as ""Meh"") instead of ""The Last Duel"", which I liked and would happily see a second time.', ""This is one of those I nearly didn't watch, Not a very good story but very well acting the only reason it's not 10/10 because it's too long, enjoyable never the less nice action and the dialogue was perfect. This movie was meant for the big screen so much of it was cinematic.,It's a fantastic looking film.That duel was the best unpredictable part of the story, and the fight was very well. There was good amount of blood and intensity to make me excited,One of the best movies of 2021 so farDon't listen to the poor reviews\nRecommended for everyone who wishes to see something truly unique and interesting.Well done for all acters."", ""This is a story of the same events told through different viewpoints. And with each viewpoint, you're going to notice major differences, as well as subtle ones.It's a perfect example of how unreliable people are when they tell their side of the story. How people both intentionally and unintentionally choose to change and omit important parts of it. How everyone remembers things differently."", 'Really enjoyed it! Worth the watch. Great actors and still such a great director. Not his best work but still great. Always worth watching his movies.', ""The Last Duel got some strong points - acting is good and the production fine. What drags the movie down for me is the duration and somehow I was never really engaged with the main body of the story (the crime), so I had from time to time really to fight to keep my attention on the movie - to use Akira Kurosawa's different perspective technique (Rashomon) was in my opinion no wise choice. What's left to say? Best parts of the movie are for certain the battle scenes and the duel in the end, and the high production value regarding settings, costumes etc. The Last Duel - for sure no bad movie but belongs certainly not to the best of Ridley Scott's work."", 'Two things stand out in this period movie based on actual events. First, there was a time a medieval history when rape was not considered a crime against woman, but rather a crime against man as a violation of property rights! Second, the duel was not a contest of fighting skill but a process of trial and judgment. Upon losing, the loser\'s status changed devastatingly, from a knight and fighter to a detested criminal condemned by God, stripped naked, dragged behind a horse on the dirt, and finally hung up-side-down for display.While the narrative borrows from Rashomon and the plotline of both include an alleged rape, ""The last duel"" is no ""Rashomon"". The events narrated by the three parties in TLD are far less conflicting than that in Rashomon. They differ not so much in details as in perception, whether it was rape, a charge brought in front of the King of France, or merely ""adultery"" as the accused claimed. Let me back up a little.While both Jean de Carrouges (Matt Damon) and Jacques Le Gris (Adam Driver) were esquire to liege lord Pierre d\'Alencon (Ben Afflect), their fortune were markedly different. Le Gris, slick and manipulating, was the clear favourite. Carrouges, unrefined and headstrong, was nobody\'s favourite, as well as ""broke"" and ""need money"" as he declared himself. While they started out as friends, with Carrouges saving Le Gris\'s life at the Battle of Limoges, relationship between the two deteriorated continuously, culminating in the Carrouges charging Le Gris of raping his wife Marguerite (Jodie Comer) while he was away. As always, the verdict boils down to whether there was consent. As no conclusive evidence emerged, an all but obsolete (but still in effect) law was evoked, duel in combat, for God to render judgment. The depiction of the movie, through the Rashomon mode as mentioned, quite clearly suggests that this was rape.As easily surmised, this movie is dialogue-heavy. However, with credentials like ""The Gladiator"", Ridley Scott did not disappoint with the climactic, long duel finale. Acting, still, is the stuff this movie is made of. Affleck is miscast and wasted. Damon is solid and Driver continues to showcase his versatility and talent. It is Comer, however, who really shines. Elevated to wide recognition by ""Killing Eve"" and confirmed by ""Free Guy"", Comer is on her way to stardom.', ""Legendary acting and scenario... It may just seem a little boring to some people. But that doesn't mean the movie is bad. The plot of the film is very well processed. In addition, the film reflects its time very well. I think it deserves 8 points. I did not give 2 stars. This is because of the last duel that gave the film its title. The last duel didn't go as I expected. I wouldn't expect professional soldiers to fight with many mistakes. And I think the last duel should have lasted longer. Anyway, despite everything, it was a movie that I loved very much. Have a good time. Don't forget to watch this movie in a calm state. This increases the pleasure you will get."", ""Excellent perfomances elevate meandering script which also drags a little and doesn't fully justify its structure. But scenes that work are really impressive, especially the last duel. Jodie Comer is a real standout with a nuanced perfomance that should get a lot of awards attention. All in all a perfectly fine movie but nothing you haven't seen before."", 'An excellent film about a historical incident. Well directed and written.This movie brings to light the how strongly paternalistic and misogynistic society was in medieval times and how much your point of view can vary according to your place in this highly hierarchized world.Here you have the illiterate knighted husband who wants to defend his honor and sees himself as a hero, the friend who likes to think the wife of the knight has a crush in him and the wife who suffered abuse and seeks justice only to find herself treated as property and risking an atrocious death for telling the truth.Magnificent acting by Jodie Comer and Adam Driver.', 'If you are blown away by her performance in killing eve get ready to be blown away again by her worthy of an Oscar performance in the last duel , her character is the exact opposite of villanelle and she is equally believable playing this sympathetic character to the point of breaking your heart , she absolutely stole the show , I am so glad she is starting to capitalize on the success of killing eve and getting to play big parts in great movies like this one .', ""Ridley Scott doing a period drama is something that i always look up to. This is definitely a amazing movie. It uses a rashamon effect narative technique to show the perspectives of 3 people on a event. The action scenes are amazing, especially the duel in the end. The duel was shot so amazingly, genuinely made me kept on thinking what's going to happen next and who is going to win the duel. The movie is technically marvelous. The movie also tries to show how in their own perspectives everyone is right. There is no much difference to the events taking place in each perspectives, but slight variations that make a lot of difference. There are also many other subjects like how men are behind power, how hard it is for a women to talk about Attrocties done to her, some aspects of the senslessness of relegion. The movie is very engaging, even though the same events are being narrated again it held my attention completely. Jodie comer is just amazing in her role, She gets the most scope to perform in the movie. Adam driver, matt Damon and ben affleck were good in their roles."", '***This review will contain details about this movie that some may consider spoilers. I\'ve tried to keep them as brief and non-specific as possible.***Usually after I\'ve watched a movie for the first time, I can say definitively whether I liked it or not. The Last Duel is a rare exception whereby I couldn\'t (and to some degree still can\'t) decide how I feel about it, so I remain somewhat neutral. I don\'t hate the movie, but I don\'t absolutely love it either.Nevertheless, I would still recommend giving it a watch simply because it\'s an interesting story in which the subject matter remains hugely relevant in modern times. It is also visually stunning (with the exception of Matt Damon\'s mullet) and the cinematography is breathtaking.With that said, I will break down what I liked about this film and what I did not. Keep in mind, these are just my own thoughts and preferences that affect my personal enjoyment and appreciation of a film. I\'ll start with what I didn\'t like first so that I can end this review on a more positive note.The first thing I found off-putting about the movie was that Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Adam Driver were in it. Not because they are bad actors (they are certainly not), but because casting American A-list actors in a period film ruins the immersion for me. Remember the time Game of Thrones gave Ed Sheeran a cameo appearance? It caused an immersion outrage! That\'s sort of what I experienced with the Last Duel. Instead of focusing on the story, I became fixated on judging the quality of Damon\'s, Affleck\'s, and Driver\'s British Accents.To be fair, I do this with EVERY actor who modifies their regular accent for a film role. If it\'s less than perfect (which it often is) I find it to be a distraction. Christian Bale is one of the few actors that I feel does accents perfectly. Matt Damon\'s British accent is (to my ears anyway) embarrassingly bad. Adam Driver\'s was surprisingly not bad, and Ben Affleck\'s was okay (though more Irish sounding). The point is, I don\'t want to be thinking about this while watching a movie, but I can\'t help it. It makes me wonder if actors also find themselves distracted by it, perhaps focusing more on getting their accent right instead of acting out the scene right.Having one American actor may have been less of a big deal for me, but putting three in lead roles was just too much of a distraction for me. Their acting was just ""okay"" in this movie. Damon and Affleck are both brilliant actors, but in The Last Duel, not so much. Either way, their presence in a medieval-themed period drama was an immersion killer. I probably would have liked the movie more if they had cast lesser-known, British actors (or even French which would have been even better).Now for what I liked: basically everything else. I disagree that the movie was too long. I think it\'s as long as it needed to be to tell the story in a meaningful, coherent way. There are three different perspectives being told of the same story, so it makes sense that they should all get equal screen time. And it\'s those perspectives which I found the most fascinating, because they made sense psychologically.There are two types of truths: there is your truth and the actual, objective truth. And when it comes to personal experiences, the truth is largely subjective. The way you see yourself is subjective. The way you perceive your actions is subjective. You may see yourself as a loving, caring husband. You may see yourself as having committed an act that you felt was not a crime, and therefore proclaim your innocence. But then there is the ACTUAL truth. What REALLY happened, and who was affected by those actions.In a way, all three perspectives are the ""truth"", because no one seems to be deliberately lying";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I think you are meant to draw the connection with Ahab who was driven by his own rage with the rage of the father which destroyed his family to the rage which Tommy now feels. Even though he is drunk it is no coincidence that his father refers to Tommy as Ahab and bellows at him to stop the ship. At the point that Tommy takes him in his arms and holds him he begins the healing process but loses what makes him such a formidable fighter. Thus he is simply unable to blow his brother away in the way that he has done to every other opponent.The other crucial point (and you would have to be a younger brother to fully get this one) is that Tommy doesn't really want to beat his brother at that point. He needs to know that his brother loves him and perhaps that he regrets not reaching out to him when they were younger. The fact that he taps out only at the point when Brendan says he loves him is significant as is the fact that he breaks down in the corner before the final round. Had he still been carrying his rage he would surely rather have been rendered unconscious than submit.In other words, for me it was the perfect ending and the more you think about the film the more profound it seems.All in my view of course. Which could be a load of old rubbish."", 'This movie is truly, truly OUTSTANDING! I am in complete shock over the performances in this film. Nick Nolte, as usual, gives a gritty, gut wrenching, emotional performance that left me buckling at the knees. One of my all time favorite movies of Mr. Nolte was Rich Man, Poor Man, absolutely a god given talent! The performances of Mr. Hardy and Mr. Edgeron were academy award winning, I would love to see more of them by far! I cried throughout the movie, and when it was over, I could not wait to tell everyone about it. A terrific ensemble cast and movie that certainly should be up for Best Picture!! A definitive Oscar nod for Nick Nolte, and if it were up to me, Mr. Hardy and Mr. Edgeron would walk away with one as well! If you have not seen this movie, drop what you are doing, run to your nearest theater. This movie is truly what being a performer is all about! My hat is off to you all!!!', 'There aren\'t many fight movies I\'d rate as high as a \'10\', and by fight movies I\'m talking about boxing as the subject. ""Rocky"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" are the only two I can think of off hand. But this movie transcends the genre and is so much more than a film about a pair of brothers reaching for the gold ring in the arena of mixed martial arts. There\'s a lot of human drama on display, and the three principals in the story pull off some of the most incredible performances one is likely to see in a film like this.I was taken aback a bit by the number of other reviewers on this board who admitted to shedding a tear over parts of the story line. Some of the scenes affected me the same way and it\'s a little difficult to explain why, but the characters are so anguished and real that one can relate to them on some visceral level. I was especially heartened to see how the students of Sparta High School got behind their physics teacher, Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) during the War at the Shore. That just showed a whole lot of loyalty and civic pride for the school to turn out the way they did.The entire backdrop to the fight story of course is the anguished and disrupted home life of Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte), an alcoholic on the mend approaching a thousand days of sobriety, but with the inability to connect with the sons who abandoned him. I was a little surprised that the resolution to the story didn\'t involve Nolte\'s character engaging more purposefully with either Brendan or Tommy (Tom Hardy). It\'s left open ended, just as Tommy\'s status with the military is left open ended, though if you follow your instincts, the outcomes wouldn\'t necessarily be rewarding.As for the fight scenes, I\'d have to go on record stating that this movie has the best edited action in the ring I\'ve ever seen. Though the pace is often relentless, none of it looks staged or phony, a credit to all the players involved and the principal photographer. Regarding the outcome of the final match, well before ring time one\'s brain scrambles trying to guess the outcome, as this is one film and one battle where you don\'t want either brother to lose, and you can\'t imagine the twist that will make the final verdict worthwhile. I won\'t spoil it here either, you\'ll just have to see and judge it for yourself.', ""Grab your popcorn, buy your soda..and get ready for a great movie.From start to finish, this movie will have you hooked. There is no weak spot in this movie. The acting is amazing. The story is great. The music is catchy. You will get emotionally invested throughout this story.This movie will make you FEEL something. This movie will ENTERTAIN you.This film has great drama, action, and story. I walked out of the movie being so impressed, and in shock how this hadn't gotten more attention or done better at the box office.This movie is a MUST SEE. And I'm pretty picky.

Predator is Epic Sci-fi Action movie of the 80\'s, my number 1 personal favorite best action sci-fi classic film of all time. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and the rest of his team are all the time in the jungle hunted by an alien Predator, that\'s what makes this film and story more interesting than. This is very fast paced action flick, you never get bored or you fall a sleep. My favorite best Action Sci-Fi Flick movie was always Predator and It always will be. Is my number 1 Schwarzenegger best Action Sci-Fi Epic movie. The best action movie ever made! Major Alan ""Dutch"" Schaefer is my comic book hero this is my hero. The hunted becomes the hunter on the end of the film when he camouflage with mud to defend him self against the Predator-ultimate hunter and hunts him down by setting booby-traps for him the best! ""If it bleeds, we can kill it."" In the remote jungle of a Central American country, an elite group of commandos led by Major Dutch Schaeffer, embarks on a CIA mission to clear out a guerrilla stronghold and rescue the remaining hostages. However, the hunters become the hunted when a highly intelligent, otherworldly being slowly and methodically starts killing off members of Dutch\'s team. Possessing a chameleon like camouflaging ability and a deadly alien arsenal, the creature tracks down the soldiers one by one.This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it\'s not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with an $98 million budget (in 1987!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used.This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Richard Chaves, Elipidia Carillo, Shane Black, Sonny Landham and Kevin Peter Hall they are all believable in their roles and even add to the humor that this movie has. This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today. And let\'s all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall, who died a year after he had made Predator 2.Predator is the 1980\'s most adrenaline-pumping, action-packed, violent mainstream film of the decade, a film replete with nearly non-stop action, loud, messy violence, huge muscles, big guns, and an extraterrestrial killing machine with infrared sight and a laser cannon on his shoulder thrown in for good measure. The film\'s budget was around $15 million. 20th Century Fox released it in the United States on June 12, 1987, where it grossed $59,735,548.

Army of the Dead;2021;Action, Crime, Drama;5.8;R;57;Zack Snyder;Dave Bautista, Ella Purnell, Ana de la Reguera, Omari Hardwick, Theo Rossi, Matthias Schweighöfer, Nora Arnezeder, Hiroyuki Sanada, Garret Dillahunt, Tig Notaro, Raúl Castillo, Huma Qureshi, Samantha Win, Richard Cetrone, Michael Cassidy, Steve Corona, Chelsea Edmundson, Zach Rose;Following a zombie outbreak in Las Vegas, a group of mercenaries take the ultimate gamble, venturing into the quarantine zone to pull off the greatest heist ever attempted.;"[""This movie is for those who can turn off your mind and just enjoy things being destroyed. Here's why:\n1) Every character death was annoying and pointless. For example, the first girl to die was betrayed and left in the kitchen. It would have been fine if they left her there to die and maybe it would create some tension in the group. Nope. She comes storming back into the hallway and then dies in front of anyone... without pointing out that the dude betrayed her. Also, why didn't anyone shoot the zombies around her? They just watched her die. Example #2: the German dude... finally uses a brain cell and decides to go for the vault. This was obviously the smart move... but he closes his friend in there and dies outside. What was his plan? To lock his friend in and just wait out there with the other zombies? What a moron. Hop in... then pull it in to close it. Example #3, the chick holding the head. Why not set the head on the floor, aim at it and walk back into the chopper. Nope. She decides to sacrifice herself. For no reason. Nice. Also, why was she carrying it around?2) The daughter is insufferable. Her reasoning for even being in the movie is a joke. She cares soooo much about this random mom that she just has to go back in there for her. False. When the helicopter crashes, the chick doesn't look for the mom or care about her at all. She only goes up to her dad. The script just forgets about the mom. I honestly was hoping the daughter would die because she only complicated things and makes bad decisions. Why assume the people are in the Olympus? Why not ask your dad to go with you? Why not bring more than a pistol into the quarantine area? But apparently we should care about her because the main character does.3) Every shot is a headshot. Even the daughter shoots the main zombie in the head twice from 50 yards. The zombies decide to not bit when they are clearly in biting distance. This basically made the movie boring because you knew the main characters weren't in any danger until a scene was coming to a close.4) They leave the gate wide open when walking into the quarantined area. This killed me. I guess I should have stopped thinking at this point in the movie.5) If the bad dude's plan was just to get the vile of blood, then why not shoot the scout. Take its blood and leave. Tell the group they will get paid and let's go back now. Nope. Betray everyone for no reason (tell them you'll kill the helicopter pilot for no reason) and go for a head of the main chick. Cool.6) Why did the zombies keep some people for a few days? No explanation... just need to keep the mom alive so the girl is justified in ruining everything. Actually.. why would the girl even assume she was alive. What a dumb character.7) Robot zombies? What? Why? I assume the Mexico City sequel will explain that the government created the alphas to control the others and use the zombies as weapons. But IDK. Cause it seemed like the government wanted zombie blood, which they could have gotten if that was the case. Makes no sense.6/10 is generous. Only points given are for... releasing a movie during covid. At least it made me go to the theater."", '***Possible mild spoilers ahead ***I had such high hopes for this one. The slow-pacing of the first act promises something more than the typical two-dimensional characters, but it never pays off. When the action finally starts, it\'s just a sequence of events - this happens then that happens then something else happens. None of the character choices are driven by their backstories, they just do things to move things along to the next set piece. The pacing if awful. Just when the action gets up some steam, we pause for extended, quiet dialog scenes that add nothing to the story. Arguably the two most intiguing characters - the zombie leader and his...girlfriend? Are given no backstory at all. The action pieces are shot well enough, but nothing is all that original or memorable. The dialog is cringe worthy in a typical Zack Snyder way. The musical choices try too hard to be clever (Elvis singing ""We\'re caught is a trap..."", the Cranberries classic song ""Zombie""...) are just too on the nose to be amusing. Overall the movie is waaaay too long. By the time we hit the 2-hour mark (with another half hour to go!) I had given up caring about any of the charavters and just wanted them to drop the nuke already so I could get on with my life. Snyder fanboys will no doubt love it, as is evident by all the 9 and 10 star reviews, but for the rest of us, this one is easily skipped.', ""I'm not usually a fan of Zack Snyder's movies, but I do enjoy his visuals from time to time - maybe he should just stick to directing and leave the writing to those who know how to actually write a good movie with some interesting characters because this movie is just downright bad."", ""You can't help but appreciate Snyder for the vision he brings to his projects, even if you disagree with so many decisions that go along with them. It's a really fun escape that captures the magic of the summer blockbuster with great action set pieces and a badass ensemble, it's so hard not to recommend."", 'The 148 min runtime was way too long for the story Snyder wrote. There was just too much fluff and filler for the little substance the story actually had. Any attempts at humor were a failure, and Snyder missed many opportunities to add some good laughs to his writing.Like another reviewer stated, what was the point of the daughter anyway? All it did was create an infantile conflict ""kids don\'t listen to parents"". And never mind the ridiculousness of the many plot holes, including how she even made it that far to find her friends - who were just hanging around with zero attempt to escape on their own.I\'m not really a big fan of the Zombie genre and feel it\'s been overdone, but I did like how Snyder had the different levels of intelligence and physicality, especially the Alphas.The action and suspense was great, and the S/VFX, sets, and costumes amazing. The gore was just right. The cinematography was excellent, and contrary to other reviewers comments, I really enjoyed all cast performances, especially of course Bautista. I felt the score was a little overboard and overbearing.Nevertheless, a good one-time watch. I\'m not sure how much draw a Part 2 will have, but Snyder at least left that option open.', 'I miss these lists, they were fun!This movie was somewhat entertaining but also (and mostly) annoying:Spoilers, and in random order, enjoy:1: A leader zombie on top of a tall building, can look at a helicopter flying away, then give it 1 mile head start, go down to ground level, and still out run the helicopter on his dead horse.2: The more people talk about a nuke coming, and time running out, the more relaxed they will feel and the slower they will move.3: If a nuke is on the way and a helicopter comes to rescue you, you must still wait for the pilot to deliver a speech and give you permission to get on board, before moving at all.4: A piece of make shift metal for a helmet will act as a magnet for all bullets aimed at that person, and will never even have a mark on it, after 10+ hits.5: A woman who says she has a plan, while holding a zombie head, will keep staring at the helicopter taking off, probably because she remembered she didn\'t really have a plan.6: The Military generally needs their orders given 2-3 times before reacting, and they will then react very slowly and with seemingly no training.7: Having dark skin protects you from massive nuclear radiation in the same way it protects you better from the UV rays from the sun, compared to a very pale person.8: A young woman with no military training will have trouble shooting a zombie in the head at point blank range but can hit 8 running zombies in the head with 8 bullets, from a distance.9: A movie can last 2½ hours and still have very little character development.10: People will call a young man ""a kid"" and make fun of him, because he\'s the nerdy safe cracker, in spite him having huge biceps and broad shoulders, like we know all nerds generally have in real life.11: Noone will question why a billionaire wants a team to retrieve pocket cash for him.12: A random woman is important to save, except if she gets on a helicopter, then we don\'t even have to see if she survives or not.13: If a billionaire wants a live zombie head for himself, he won\'t just send a few hunters with a net to retrieve the first zombie they encounter, he will send an entire oblivious team with a mole in it, with a bank heist cover, and hope his mole can come through, because that\'s more fun, and the first option is too simple.14: If 2 people on an elevator sees Zombies when the doors open, they will freeze up completely, because who expects to run into zombies in a city crawling with zombies?15: Custom made hand grenades become fire balls when they explode.', ""The latest Hollywood zombie blockbuster comes in the shape of ARMY OF THE DEAD (2021), made by Netflix and directed by Zach Snyder, no stranger to the genre after his 2004 DAWN OF THE DEAD remake. This one's an 'anything goes' comic book-style action adventure in which a crack team are sent into Las Vegas to retrieve a fortune from an underground vault. Two things complicate the situation: 1) the entire city is shortly to be nuked, and 2) the city is overrun with fast-moving zombies. I had no idea what to expect from this one and the end result is enjoyable to a degree, albeit with plenty of caveats.The main problem with the film is that it's surprisingly cliched. ALIENS seems to be a particular inspiration here, with one character a direct copy of Vasquez and the entire climax essentially copying the James Cameron classic. The second problem is that at two and a half hours in length it goes on far too long, with characters regularly pausing for heart-to-heart conversations - ridiculous when they're surrounded by zombies and, later on, a bomb is due to detonate in twenty minutes! A Hollywood trope I always hate to see. Half an hour excised from this would have made it pacier and more exciting. On the plus side, once it gets going it holds together quite nicely, with tons of gory mayhem and a kind of zombie hierarchy that feels based on the White Walkers in GAME OF THRONES";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But, on the other hand, this is a stupid film, just an action flick, trying to be emotional and meaningful but turned out trying to be a blockbuster.I hope you see what i mean. I have rated this film 7, because of the reasons above, as the clever cinematography mixed with some good fun comedy and watchable action can't be that harmless can it. Can it? See for yourself."", 'It may be unfair to say, but its easily admitted that the most interesting ploy this film can rely on was the media storm surrounding ""THE affair"" that led to ""THE Hollywood couple to be"" Brangelina. As a matter of fact, the film is actually rather good and the playful yet genuine chemistry berween Pitt and Jolie excuses the ludicrous plot and reliance on marketing gimmicks. The film really isn\'t a serious one, but it is a sexy one.', 'I saw an advance screening of this movie tonight, and I must say it far exceeded my expectations! Of course, due to the stars involved I knew there\'d be sex appeal. And due to the advertising I knew there\'d be plenty of stuff ""gettin\' blowed up real good."" But what I wasn\'t expecting was the tongue in cheek jokes, dark humor, and respectable plot twist! Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will only fuel rumors of their relationship with their performances - their chemistry on screen is scintillating, to say the least. The allure of each actor as an individual is undeniable, but when they\'re together, whether getting busy or getting pummeled, the screen fairly sizzles. It\'s a popcorn, Hollywood movie, of course, and you\'ll have to get past the fact that the two leads are the only two among many professional killers who seem to be decent shots! But the action is kickin, the acting well above par, the leads luminous, the plot is lots of fun, and the laughs are plenty. Enjoy! I sure did...', ""Back when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were getting more attention than any couple since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton it seemed serendipitous that Mr.&Mrs. Smith arrived as a film vehicle to take advantage of all that publicity. It certainly features the sex appeal of both. With a lot of violence thrown in as well. In fact the violence is positively erotic at times.Pitt and Jolie are a pair of hit people who work for different arms of the federal government and if you can believe it have no idea what the other does. They get assigned from their agencies to the same case, but one to protect, the other to destroy a target played by Adam Brody. After that they learn of each other and try to kill each other.Even before Jolie was raiding tombs as Lara Croft she certainly had the fighting skills and spirit. Looking at the two of them I really got the impression they were having some great fun together. That fact really permeates your experience watching Mr.&Mrs. Smith.Just beware lest you think that this is remake of the Alfred Hitchcock film Mr.&Mrs. Smith.

Coupled with Back to the Future, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, the 80s was a rather unique time for teen movies. The Karate Kid just happened to be another one of those films. With the immortal Pat Morita leading the way, this film was not only touching, but put a whole new spin on the `zero-to-hero' story line which we have all seen too often. Ralph Macchio may have had no career after these film, but at least he proved to be comparable as Daniel (san). Sure, the ending and outcome proved to be a little predictable, but the film was still a winner."", 'Hoping, once again, for another massive box office hit, like his 1976\'s film \'Rocky\' did, director, John G. Avildsen & his crew, mimics a lot of the tropes and themes of that fighter movie for his new film, \'the Karate Kid\'. The risk was successful, as this underdog sport movie, about a young man, Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) standing up for himself, against his high school bullies, by joining a karate tournament was a smash hit with most critics and audiences. However, it\'s not a perfect film, as there is plenty of stuff that, worth nitpicking, that could had made the movie, a little better. One of them, was honestly, making the various lengthy, menial chores like waxing cars, sanding decks and painting fences that Daniel had to do in the film, seem to have more meaning to it than it portray in the film. After all, they come across as too out there & unorthodox to be relate to karate.

Of the two, ""Sonic"" is definitely my favorite...simply because it was more fun and the plot was simpler and more enjoyable.The story isn\'t all that important...so instead, I\'ll just say that it\'s a buddy picture, of sorts. The crazed Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) is seeking to capture or destroy Sonic....so it\'s up to Sonic\'s new friend (James Marsden) to help him avoid this nutty guy.The choice to hold off release to make Sonic look less creepy was a very good one. Additionally, the story is fun...and not especially complicated. Good for kids...as well as parents forced to watch it with them!', ""Overall - Had lots of laughs at the cinema with a friend. But don't go in with high expectations.Having just watched Sonic, I can say that it was an enjoyable movie. Many of the elements that make up the movie has been seen before but the movie executes them well enough for them to be justified and certainly funny.Standout from the cast is Jim Carrey, who steals the show, especially in one scene in which he is experimenting with something that belongs to Sonic.Visual Effects and Sonic himself could have done with a little more polish but its adequate."", ""Which incedently for Sonic isn't an issue (he's fast you know). I don't know how much you know about the little Hedgehog and his game history, but even without any knowledge at all, the movie will make sense to you. Certain things, like the rings and hoarding them is one of the things you do when you play him .. wait that didn't came out wrong did it? I hope not, this is a childrens movie after all.Jim Carrey really relishes and dives into his evil character! He has quite the fun with him and a lot of interesting zingers/one liners. This is overall a funny and entertaining little movie. Is it flawed? For sure - should you care though? The movie won't be fun if you do! Now that does not mean that the studio doesn't listen! The first trailer had quite the catastrophic reactions from fans all over the world ... so back to the drawing board (I guess almost literally) and a new improved Sonic was developed ... nicely done!

It actually turned out to be fairly entertaining and the kids wound up laughing a lot and had a good time. In fact, the two who were visiting from a couple hours away called it the best thing they did all weekend. So grandpa scored a few points there if I must say so. Not being familiar with the Sonic character, everything about him was new to me. The combination of live action and animation appeared to work well as Sonic teams up with Donut Lord Tom Wachowski (James Marsden) to thwart the evil designs of Ivo Robotnik (Jim Carrey) to take over the world. Colorful cinematography and a frantic pace keeps the action moving along, so if you happen to come across a couple of stray family members, why not take them to see the flick. It wouldn't be the worst afternoon you ever spent."", ""The movie is fun. It has some fun jokes. Robotnik is a really fun character with witty, fun dialogue. The movie understands what it is, and doesn't try to be something it is not, which is good. It doesn't take itself too seriously. There are some problems in the logic, as there is never a sense of real urgency in Sonic as he travels by car to San Francisco (even when he can clearly run properly again). Tom being all over the news never has a real impact in the plot.\nThe conflict in the movie is actually there and keeps it interesting. Sonic is very charming and fun to watch. Overall, the movie is enjoyable and good.Oh, and Tails cameo was so great. Made me super excited."", ""A small and extremely garrulous hedgehog-like creature called Sonic finds his way to our world where police officer Tom becomes his unwilling guardian, while mad scientist Dr Robotnik covents him for his amzing speed powers.I spent a great deal of time 20 years ago watching my children enjoy Sonic from his earliest incarnations (I also learned that hand/eye coordination was not high on my list of gifts, which is why I was generally watching rather than playing). This film contrives a plot of sorts on which to hang Sonic's computer game attributes together with a moral object lesson.In short, it's a family film with jazzy visuals, a lot of callbacks to the videogames, Jim Carrey in full over-the-top mode, enugh story to serve, a dusting of fart gags, and an air of likeability. It's nothing spectacular, but it's tolerable fun.

Yes stuff was left out. Yes some things were inaccurate. And yes, at times the story jumped around. But I\'ll tell you what, if that\'s the price to pay for being able to see fantastic literature on the big-screen...I\'ll take a few inconsistencies any day.For having the task of taking 870 masterful pages and turning them into a 2.5 hour movie, David Yates did one heck of a job. This movie is a must-see, no matter how you look at it. For book-readers, sure you notice the absence of certain parts, but you finally get to see what you\'ve imagined in your head for years take place in real-live motion on the screen\x85and you know what, those few things left out, help you gain a better understanding anyway, because you have already read the in-between stuff. Then, in the same breath, this is a great movie for non-book-readers as well. For those HP fans who take the lighter approach of skipping the books and simply following along by the movies\x85you won\'t know what you\'re missing anyway. The biggest complaints about this movie will be from book-readers who wanted a 10-hour long, word-for-word re-creation of the book. Other than that, there is nothing to complain about. Acting was great, story-line was great, and the special effects were flawless.(Slight Spoiler In This Paragraph) Being a book-reader, I knew heading in that I would have to be prepared to accept substantial cuts from all that takes place in the book.

Together, they must recover an item that has been stolen by an intergalacti... Read all;"['God, do I remember when this movie came out in the summer of \'97. This movie brought aliens back in the strongest way possible, everyone was singing Will Smith\'s catchy song of the same title. But I remember seeing this movie and just wearing out the VHS when we got it. As a 12 year old kid, I just adored this movie and so badly wanted to be apart of the Men in Black. I thought they were so cool. Years later, I got the DVD because I wanted to go for a trip down memory lane, this may not be as cool as when I was a kid but this is still a very fun sci-fi flick that makes you laugh, squirm and also has some good scares. There is a reason why Will Smith is a star, he made this movie a riot to watch and has every star quality you could imagine. He and Tommy Lee Jones take us on an incredible ride through our world where the person that lives next door to you just might be an alien.Agent K is a member of the Men in Black, a secret agency without ties to any government, whose goal is to maintain Earth as a ""neutral zone"" for aliens seeking refuge. K\'s former partner, D, has just retired, but identifies New York City detective James Edwards as a potential replacement, due to his agility to follow a disguised alien. After putting Edwards through several tests, K offers him the chance to join the MIB, which Edwards accepts. Edwards\' past identity is erased, and he becomes Agent J, assigned to K by the agency director, Zed. The fleet warns that a ""Bug,"" a member of a giant cockroach-like alien species that are currently at war with another alien race, has crashed down to Earth and is seeking an object known as the Galaxy that would turn the tide in favor of the Bugs. To prevent this, they are willing to destroy the Earth unless the MIB can secure the Galaxy before their deadline within a day.The make up effects in this movie are just incredible. The main villain that was the bug was one of the creepiest looking things you\'ve ever seen. Vincent D\'Onofrio who is one of those great secrets of Hollywood always delivers an outstanding performance makes the villain even more creepier because of his jerks and twitches. The CGI effects are very noticeable but I don\'t think they could have gone any other way since the aliens are over the top. The humor is on key, one of my favorite scenes is when Tommy Lee Jones is trying to find out information and you see Will Smith in the background who is helping a lady give birth to an alien and the tentacles come out and start carrying him around everywhere and even slam him on the car. Men in Black is the definition of a summer blockbuster, it\'s funny, action packed, had the great actors and a very catchy song that is now stuck in my head thanks to this review. I still like Men in Black, I think anyone who just lets go and watches this film is guaranteed to have a good time too.7/10', ""Agents Jay (Will Smith) and Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) protect our world, that is crammed full of aliens who live among us, and most of them are respectful citizens of planet Earth, but every race can have a bad apple or two. Smith and Jones make an unlikely pair, but they work in harmony really well here, and it's a pretty funny adventure.Fine special effects help to bring the aliens in MIB to life, and they have as much character as the duo in black, and they get just as many laughs. The film carries a good plot and is entertaining from the opening scene";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The cinematography, performances, battle sequences sound design are all top notch. I do feel as if the movie became a little too scattered before the big battle halfway through the movie, and could have done a better job developing characters. It's a minor complaint but you will feel the runtime of the movie during certain points.One scene that will stay with me for a long time was the sequence in the crater. I was a complete and utter mess during that whole sequence. Seeing Paul gain his humanity back for the fallen soldier absolutely broke me.All Quite on the Western front may not saying anything new about war, but it's a relevant-sobering reminder of the futility of war. One that will stay with you long after the credits roll."", ""I watched this film today in Berlin and my god, I couldn't find a fault with it. The cinematography, the acting, the set, and the portrayal of the brutality of war was all just perfect. There is no glorification, it's tragic, but it feels true. The original author of the book based it on his personal experience in the trenches, which certainly came through in the movie.This is a film that should be viewed by anybody thinking of joining the army and it couldn't have been released at a better time, given that there is another war in Europe. I really hope Netflix gives it Russian subtitles and makes it free for Russian-speaking audiences, because I don't think I've come across a war movie that is more anti-war than this. There is a reason why the book was banned in Nazi Germany.This film absolutely deserves ten stars."", ""I've just came out of the TIFF presentation of this film. Before going in, I assumed that little could be done with the story and the presentation would be one of cinematic sequences and sound. I wasn't wrong, and boy was I blown away (excuse the terrible pun).After leaving the theatre, I'd say that it was more an experience than a film, one that at time I found difficult to witness. Not for the faint of heart, this isn't a film that'll be easy to forget.Not having read the book but having seen its two predecessors, it's easy to get engulfed in the production and feel like you're seeing this story for the first time."", ""Oh dear. I still feel bad. But not because the film is bad. Because it shows how incredibly bad that time was. Especially for the young men who were forced to go to war. I'm from Osnabrück - the city where Erich Maria Remarque was born - and when they named the city in the film... my body is still shaking. The actors were amazing. I dont like german films so much, but this is different. The camera, the sound. Its perfect (except one role - otherwise it would be a 10 for me). I even didn't touch my snacks in the cinema. You really have to see this movie. Because it shows the cruel time in a way that perhaps no film has ever done before. However, if you want to spend a nice evening in a good mood, don't watch it. Because it really pulls you down. But it's all worth it. Thanks for this history lesson!"", ""In the excellent 1930s original, war is seldom better summarised than by: 'It's dirty and painful to die for your country, when it comes to dying for your country it's better not to die at all. There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good does it do?'.It's a statement that applies just as well today, and complimented by this outstanding piece of film making too, which leaves us under no illusions of man's inhumanity to man. The performances are truly incredible, the technical achievement recreating scenes of war outstanding, and the messages as clear as any about the futility of armed combat and the inability of the human race to learn its lessons - even to this day. Not really a film to enjoy, but certainly a film to reflect on how far we haven't come since 1918, especially in a world that often seems so intent on pulling itself apart."", 'I watched this last night after much anticipation. I was fairly quickly surprised by how soon in the film we got to the front.Where was the schoolroom and Baumer looking out of the window, daydreaming and sketching?Where was the baiting of the postman (to become training corporal) Himmelstoss?Where was the training, the mud field, the bullying by Himmelstoss? Kemmerich\'s boots getting passed from man to man as the owners died. The visit home and Paul\'s realisation that his family and home was now the front.We didn\'t really get to know the boys.The actual war stuff is impressive and I would imagine it was reasonably realistic (I wasn\'t at Western Front myself) but there wasn\'t actually much of a story, it was just war for war\'s sake, but maybe that was the point?It did borrow a couple of bits from the novel, Paul\'s stabbing the French soldier then his regret over it, the crippled soldier in hospital trying to kill himself, but then Kat\'s death? No, not like that, Kat was a hardened, wiley experienced soldier, he\'d not have been caught out like that and it is unlikely they would have been unarmed in that situation.It is good the way that they work the story in to the last hours of the war but that is missing the whole point of AQOTWF.The point is that when Paul dies (either reaching for the butterfly or trying to sketch the bird as in the previous versions, I can\'t remember how EMR wrote it in the book) it isn\'t the end of the war, it is just another day during the war.The communique at the end of those earlier versions says simply ""all quiet on the Western Front"" and the point is a man has just died but as far as anyone is concerned there\'s nothing going on, its just another day the same as those before and those to follow. That is the poignancy of Paul\'s death and the example of how worthless life had become.This new version misses that point with its last set piece battle in the few minutes before armistice at 11am on November 11th 1918. Paul heroically (albeit reluctantly) going over the top one last time and dying fighting in a trench, Remarque wrote the death of Baumer as futile and pointless whilst he was just trying to snatch a moment of normality, a moment of his carefree previous existence.This doesn\'t mean the film is without merit, it really did happen that there were flurries of intense fighting and killing in the last few hours of the war, this wasn\'t some made up idea to add extra drama, which in itself is a sad indictment of humanity.This was a brilliant, thought provoking, stunning film that during its course borrowed some bits from All Quiet On The Western Front... but it wasn\'t All Quiet On The Western Front.', 'The 1930 and 1979 adaptions of the book are way better, you should watch them instead if you are looking for a true to source experience.This is very sad because production quality wise this movie is made very well and shows the horrors of ww1 in a gruesome and very graphic fashion that leaves no one unharmed after watching this.All in all the movie suffers greatly from the bad adaptation of the source material, despite its cinematography being very good. Still it feels like a wasted opportunity.One thing that really bothers me though and i will never understand it fully is the laziness in some of the details, for example rifles having no recoil in the battle scenes. In the opening scenes i asked myself why the german soldier is racking the bolt of his rifle because i didnt get that he was supposed to be shooting. Once you see it you can never unsee, and details like these ruin whole war movies for me personally.', 'Never expected a netflix movie to shake me to my core but this film kept me frozen in my seat even after a few minutes into the ending credits. It made me think about war and what it does to people. Just as the book had done. But this time due to the superb acting, marvelous cinematography and flawless direction that feeling will stay with me for a long time. They took a great desicion by using an all German cast which made it feel ever more real. And the way they made me feel connected to the charecters. I mourned each one of them and kept praying for the movie to be war soon ,so they could get a happy ending.', 'I\'ve just came out from the European gala premier of the movie on ZFF 18.

The story follows a disillusioned Civil War veteran who's recruited to train the Japanese army in Western warfare as they prepare to take on a Samurai rebellion. Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe lead the cast and give excellent performances. The directing is also quite remarkable, and captures the spiritual aspects of nature and of the Samurai culture. Additionally, the writing does an effective job at depicting the culture clashes, and at developing the characters. The score by Hans Zimmer is brilliantly done as well, perfectly complementing the film and enhancing the themes. The Last Samurai is a smart and passionate drama that's well-crafted and compelling."", 'It is said that the only thing constant is change. Old ideals die off, and new technologies replace the inefficiencies of yesteryear. The young usually have little trouble adjusting to change, but traditionalists are often dragged into the new era either kicking and screaming or silently resolved to remove themselves completely.""The Last Samurai"" manages to capture a little of both, with Japanese men living in a world in transition from ancient bushido rituals of honor into a more modern empire of industry and trade. A sweeping historical epic that hints at the brilliance of Akira Kurosawa\'s finest work while also invoking the melancholy of a Shakespearean tragedy, the movie is a reminder of the cost of high ideals and danger of industrial conformity.It\'s 1876, and Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is an alcoholic wreck of a man. A veteran of the Civil War as well as General Custer\'s Indian campaigns, he drifts from one situation to another ostensibly looking for work but really seeking refuge from his inner demons of slaughtering innocent women and children.Opportunity knocks in the form of an old Army acquaintance Colonel Ben Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), who has accepted work with a Japanese businessman named Omura (Masato Harada). Omura has been charged with recruiting American war vets as military advisors to the new Japanese Army. Emperor Meiji, under advise from Omura and other parties, is interested in modernizing his nation\'s military with rifles and other armaments.In order to unify the nation, the powers that be must first take care of civil dissidence within Japan. The samurai, led by charismatic chieftain Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), are violently opposing the invasion of Western culture into their islands. Bagley foolishly sends his ill-trained soldiers into combat against the samurai, and during the resulting massacre Algren is captured and taken to the samurai\'s village.During the course of the winter, Algren slowly gains the trust of his captors and in turn is given free roam over the village. He fights with Uijo (Hiroyuki Sanada), who dislikes the American from the beginning, and is given food and shelter by Taka (Koyuki), the wife of one of samurai he killed during battle.Katsumoto meanwhile seeks to learn about his enemy, and begins to respect Algren as a fellow warrior. Also interested in the American is Katsumoto\'s son Nobutada (Shin Koyamada), intrigued by Western culture. Algren finds the first peace he has known in a long time, and begins to adapt to the ways of the samurai. He acts as a surrogate father to Taka\'s children, learns to sword fight with a kitana blade and begins to respect the culture that he originally sought to destroy.But during Algren\'s absence the Japanese Army has had better opportunity to prepare themselves, and time is soon approaching that will determine the fate of the samurai and the future of Japan.""The Last Samurai"" is beautifully filmed by John Toll, the same cinematographer who worked on ""Braveheart."" The comparisons are obvious with moments of silent reflection and loud explosions of fury, both powerfully captured on film.Director Edward Zwick brings the same determination to the screen that he did more than a decade ago with ""Glory."" The attention to period detail is near flawless and the movie never releases its grip on the audience.As Algren, Cruise grows from suicidal depression to driven idealist quite realistically, drawing on the standard dishonored warrior archetype while giving him touches of humanity. Cruise\'s only shortcoming is his lack of dramatic range, and as such it never seems like Algren has any sinister intent even when acting selfishly. Never for a moment is there a doubt that he\'s destined to be a hero.Cruise is also overshadowed in every scene by Watanabe, who makes Katsumoto a honorable man who is shocked by all the dishonor threatening to overthrow his country. Philosopher, poet, family man and warrior - Katsumoto wears many hats, and is realized through Watanabe perfectly.Other smaller roles are captured by strong performances as well, including Goldwyn who brings class to the standard villain role as Bagley, Koyuki who plays Taka with quiet sadness and torn loyalties between her fallen husband and his killer who she is growing to love, and Koyamada who makes Nobutada young and headstrong but still sympathetic and honorable.""The Last Samurai"" only suffers during a protracted finale that screams of studio interference. The ending smacks of being safe, clean and Hollywood, something that almost betrays to whole film.The movie is still strong enough to become a modern day classic. Like ""The Wild Bunch,"" it speaks to those curious of what became of warriors who outlived their time. Timeless issues of honor, loyalty and redemption as well as the clashing of ancient culture versus new technology remain omnipresent. To remain in the past in foolish, but to forget it entirely is disgraceful.Nine out of ten stars. Destined to be remembered for some time, this movie honorably deals with its subject matter.', ""It's pretty enjoyable as a movie. I don't think this embrace much of the japanese culture or is historically accurate, but it's not that bad. Watch it as a modern japanese film."", 'A beautifully done film, and a sweeping and spellbinding epic in every sense. The Last Samurai is exquisitely shot, with stunning locations, wonderful cinematography and well designed costumes. The music by the ever reliable Hans Zimmer is gorgeous, dramatic in the battle sequences, and poignant in the slower scenes. Speaking of the battle sequences they were extremely well staged and came across as spine tingling. The story is strong, and the performances and direction are too. I have never really liked Tom Cruise, but here he gives one of his better performances ever in this film, sometimes I forgot that it was him acting. Billy Connelly also handles his role well, though I usually associate him with comedy. However, it is indeed Ken Watanabe who captivates, and easily walks away with the acting honours. The script is well crafted, and while the Last Samurai is sometimes overly idealistic and a tad stereotypical, me and my brother cannot help deny this is a superbly shot and well performed film. 9/10 Bethany Cox', 'An engrossing film, with great performances, stunning visuals, amazing action sequences, incredible soundtrack and a satisfying, but predictable story.', 'I disagree with a lot of the reviews of this film. Yes, it is true that it does glorify a lifestyle in an exaggerated and unfairly sublime way, but I think we\'re missing the point. This film is romanticism vs. modernism. It\'s purity vs. corruption. It\'s not so much the premise or believability, but the substance behind it.Tom Cruise is an actor who is both idolized (by fans) and ridiculed (by critics) In this film he dazzles us as a drunken U.S General haunted by a bloody past. I was pushing for him to get an Oscar Nod, but alas, None came. ""The Last Samurai"" wasn\'t particularly well received and that was disconcerting to me. I\'d recommend it to anyone with a taste for romance and for anyone who simply longs for a little less ""celebrity wedding"" and a little more ""help the old lady across the road"".', ""Glad to know how samurai lived and loved bravely. Tom cruise acting was super. The movie's screenplay was brilliant that make you sit edge of the seat till end."", ""If you have NOT seen the film then stop reading this review and go rent, buy or borrow it right now! What are you waiting for? This is a 10 out of 10 must see.The casting, location, storyline and direction of this film is simply excellent. I say this is Tom Cruise's finest acting hour. A story of honour, integrity, tradition, courage and love entwined with great battle scenes, beautiful scenery and superb acting, especially in the lead roles of Cruise and Ken Watanabe.For me personally I have no faults with this film. I do not possess a vast knowledge of Samurai history other than what we see on TV and read in magazines so cannot comment on it's depiction of true Samurai legend. A real gem."", ""Tom Cruise is entertaining and plays his serious role well. The action is well-choreographed. The costume design is intriguing. There really isn't any glaring weakness in this film but nothing is particularly stand out. A fun popcorn film for a weekend evening."", ""This seems a divisive film, for what it is (a story..not a historical reenactment based to the letter on another culture from another time period) it is good. Not groundbreaking, certainly not awful as some make out, but good. I enjoyed it and I didn't at any point feel bored or want to switch it off. I've seen Zatoichi, 13 assassin's, Blade of the immortal etc (these are great samurai movies) this movie does try to be respectful or informed of Japanese culture for that time period.

It's the story of a conspiracy surrounding Dr. Richard Kimble, a surgeon who is on the run while U.S Marshal Samuel Gerard tries to find an explanation of why Kimble was framed for the murder of his wife. The movie has a sticking nature to it, every detail in the actors face will prove that Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones deserve every praise they have received for their performance.Based on the 1960's Television series, this movie does not disappoint. It makes the watcher want to go back and view the original series to see how it compares."", ""This excellent film details the adventure of a man's search for his wife's killer and to clear himself of her murder. Harrison Ford is the hero and wanted man and on the run to escape capture by a determined U.S. Marshal in one thrilling scene after another. A spectacular train wreck with a bus of prison-bound felons gets the action underway at which point Tommy Lee Jones enters the picture and takes over the film by sheer force of personality and doesn't let go. Harrison, a resourceful type, stays just ahead of Jones in this taut cat-and-mouse thriller and adroitly leaves just enough clues for the police as he closes in on the killer. Ford and Jones are well matched here in one of the best urban crime mysteries ever filmed. Cast and Chicago locations add realism to a great story."", 'Probably the greatest modern post Hitchcock action thriller. A terrific cast led by two towering performances from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones makes the most of an intelligent script and superb direction. The 60\'s television series provided a firm base for the story, but this feature length, densely plotted movie, takes proceedings to new heights of drama, and excellence.The central premise is as old as the hills. ""The wrong that must be righted"". Ford playing Dr Richard Kimble is falsely accused of murdering his wife and the forces of good, the Police, become the agents of bad, in trying to recapture him after he escapes in a spectacular train and bus crash, as good an action sequence as you will ever see at the cinema.Tommy Lee Jones is imperious as Marshall Sam Gerrard charged with tracking him down. Wonderfully gnarled and taciturn, Gerrard starts out simply doing his job, but things change as he not only comes to respect his quarry, but also starts to have doubts about Kimble\'s guilt.The first half is all action, particularly the magnificent scene where a cornered Kimble dives down the face of a dam to escape his pursuers. The second half becomes a detective movie as Kimble returns to Chicago to find the real murderer- and clear his name. Full of twists and turns, there is an inevitable showdown at the end, and a text book ending as to how you wrap this sort of story up.Director Andrew Davis\'s previous work gave no hint of his ability to deliver such a masterpiece, although his previous effort ""Under Siege"" will have sharpened up his action skills. And subsequently, he never quite scaled these heights again.', ""Despite the fact that it was nominated for Best Picture and Tommy Lee Jones' performance took supporting actor, The Fugitve is a middling time killer with a dull Harrison Ford, a mediocre script, and a predictable outcome. An unnecessary film adapted from the 60's TV series, the direction lacks flair, and the locations and cinematography are standard television quality. The TV series had the advantage of a introducing various settings and characters as Dr. Richard Kimble fled the law and recognition. In the film, the action is repetitive and fugitive Kimbel's continued access to the hospital where he once practiced stretches both credulity and patience. In truth, for me it all just didn't really matter and the film seems somewhat overblown. There are a few good scenes, and the perennial interest in seeing the wrongly accused prevail held my attention."", 'For a good ""chase"" film, you can\'t beat \'The Fugitive\'. Not all films taken from TV series manage to make it to the big screen with a style of their own and a story worth telling. Exceptionally fine performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are the icing on the cake. The picture scores on all levels: photography, music, editing, script and performances. The bus/train crash at the start is a spectacular piece of filmmaking that gets the story off to a good start with powerful urgency. While you\'re rooting for Ford all the way, as the doctor wrongly accused of the murder of his wife, you sometimes find yourself in the shoes of the crafty, quirky detective with a sense of humor (Tommy Lee Jones) who is relentless in his pursuit. The battle between the pursued and the pursuer is the dominant theme and it is carried off with great wit and style.As absorbing as any action drama of the \'90s. I would have been happy if Harrison Ford, as well as Jones, earned an Oscar for his earnest and highly physical performance. Highly recommended.', ""The Fugitive is the biggest heart-pounding thriller I have seen in a while (and the best one this decade).  The story revolves around Dr. Richard Kimble, played by Harrison Ford to pythagorean procision.  Kimble is accused of killing his wife and is chased all over Chicago by Marshalls while looking for his wife's one armed killer.  One of these Marshalls is Samuel Gerarg (Tommy Lee Jones terrific and Oscar nod performance) who after a while believes he is innocent. Spectacularly done in the tradition of crime/drama thrillers with Ford and Jones working better together than ever before.  I found this film to be the best film experience of the early 90's, and hopefully you will too. A++"", ""The Fugitive is a modern classic - it takes the moral obligations of the law as well as a falsely accused 'fugitive' and melds them together into an action packed, beautifully scripted, intense thriller, which exceeds the watchability and originality of any other. I definitely recommend."", ""I've genuinely never even debated watching this film before but I just spotted and it on prime and thought why not it can't be that bad, but it fully exceeded my expectations massively. Like I said in my header it's great to watch Harrison Ford in his prime because he's definitely getting on a bit now. I was on the edge of my seat for ages, it's a proper nail biter. I like the way it was a lot deeper then you would've expected. I expected just your bog standard he finds out who it is and turns him in but they went the extra mile and I loved it, executed perfectly. It's a must watch if you haven't seen it. It's also another example of why older films are leagues above films new films."", ""Decent movie about a guy who's wrongly accused of killing his wife and he tries to prove his innocence. The plot was intriguing right from the start and it just keeps getting more intriguing as you don't quite know how it will end. However, one slight issue I had with the movie and I'll try not to spoil it too much is how Richard managed to survive jumping from that height because it's very unlikely anyone will survive that and if you do you'll probably become paralysed.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"[""American Sniper (2014, Clint Eastwood)\nHow does one sit down and truly measure this film especially when it so clearly hinges upon the life and actions of one of our nation's elite SEAL members embroiled in one of the most controversial military actions our nation has ever been a part of. I want to try to give a decent analysis of the film on it's own merits but also speak to the merits of Chris Kyle's story as a whole. This story more than any I've seen in recent memory drums up strong feelings both in favor of Chris Kyle and his actions and those against for various reasons. Like most things in this world and most people who take up on either side of any issue the answer truly lies somewhere in the middle. As proud Americans we like to believe in right and wrong and good and evil simple as that. We like to believe simply and without equivocation that there is evil out there that would threaten us and we can just as simply root it out and destroy it if our will is strong enough. The world, however, doesn't exist that way. There is a lot of gray in between the black and white. I digress somewhat and mainly because so many people have weighed in on this movie. So with that preamble laid down let's actually discuss the film. In this film we are presented with the story of Chris Kyle who is America's most lethal sniper with 160 confirmed kills and who's actual kills probably range in the 200-300 range. From director Clint Eastwood this story is adapted from Kyle's wildly popular book of the same title. We are introduced to Chris as an average American country boy raised with religion and hunting which are ingrained ways of life in many of the rural areas of our country. In one of the most resonating anecdotes of the film Chris' father talks about wolves, sheep and sheepdogs in distinguishing types of people basically as predators, prey and protectors and from the start we know which Chris is designed to be. After a failed stint as a cowboy he ends up joining the Navy SEALs seemingly after being prompted to it by terrorist action which works in the film to fan the flames of his patriotic figure. Not much is discussed here about the nature of the Iraq War and because that is not an issue in the film I don't want to go very far down the road of Iraq War politics because it isn't relevant to the telling of this story and is a quagmire in any case. Chris serves four tours in Iraq as a SEAL sniper. Eastwood stages some realistic, tense firefights in the Iraq scenes as well as concentrating on some of the more seemingly moral dilemmas faced by Kyle such as whether or not to kill a woman and child who are running toward a US military convoy with what may or may not be a grenade. It works to great effect that at least in the film we never see him make a misstep in these instances. He kills the woman and child who are revealed to be carrying a grenade and then stays his hand as a boy picks up a rocket launcher but then at the last second drops it and runs away. In an effort to make Chris' and by extension America's purpose very black and white in this film Eastwood sets up some antagonists for Chris to battle against which take the form of a man known as the Butcher and also a Syrian sniper named Mustafa. Eastwood sets up and executes that battle so clearly that literally after felling Mustafa who seems to be Kyle's equal on the enemy side Chris calls his wife and says his time is done and he wishes to come home. This puts out the perception that facing a crumbling marriage Kyle continues to return to action prompted by a very specific enemy. With that enemy vanquished he is free to return to his family and a normal life. Interspersed with the Iraq sequences are sequences of Chris at home between tours. He is portrayed as a reluctant hero, which is truly how we enjoy our heroes, as well as a man haunted. We assume the haunt is some form of PTSD as he grapples back in the real world over life and death decisions he made. All along the way the gruff straightforward performance from Bradley Cooper keeps Chris on his virtuous path. When confronted by his wife he reaffirms that his rationale for going is he can save American lives which is true but probably not the whole truth. Perhaps being the best sniper he feels like sending lesser individuals not up to the task is unacceptable. Whether or not Chris suffered from PTSD he seemed to find a path after his military service days by working with other veterans. Ironically and tragically it was one of these veterans that fatally shot Chris in 2013. I understand quite fully that dramatic license must be taken when adapting true life events to ensure the story flows and maintains interest. This brings up interesting topics in the Chris Kyle story because so much of the story is contingent about how he is presented as a man and an American and a patriot. If you took away the true life nature of the film and also the tragic consequence his death I don't think this film would be garnering near the attention that it has been. The war scenes are tense and dramatic but nothing overwhelming and I've seen better over the past few years. It could have entered more elevated terrain had it dealt more fully with some of the family issues they alluded to at home but once again that wasn't the story that Eastwood wanted to tell. Most notable for me about Kyle's story on film is how events were deliberately manipulated to elicit the maximum patriotic effect and response. Let me say that I believe SEAL training is just about the hardest endeavor on the planet and the men who serve in the special warfare capacity are without a doubt heroes and Kyle is no exception. He served his country bravely and rightly deserves the moniker of hero. I worry that the story as presented on screen serves up a man that is served up as a comic book hero and not presented as the full measure of a man. He is depicted as the ultimate patriot with little to no human failings and as a result when the film ends with his death we are left stricken and dumbfounded. At the very least he was much more eager to kill the enemy than the film portrayed and from Kyle's own lips he claimed it was fun to kill them and if not for his family he would have never stopped doing it. Also there has been articles that have discussed Kyle's tendency to embellish as well as a lawsuit won against Kyle by Jesse Ventura which found that Kyle fabricated an encounter he had with the former Minnesota governor. I say none of this to disparage Chris Kyle nor do I attempt to tarnish his legacy. We are human beings and we have failings. While this is a decent film that's elevated due to the fact that it's based on Kyle's life as a U.S. sniper it could have done Kyle and itself more of a service by exploring more of the truth of the man in war and at home rather than painting him in these broad Captain America brushstrokes which garnered the expected rousing patriotic response in a great deal of the populace.\nEric's Grade: B-"", ""it was extremely 'even'. nothing seemed overplayed. well balanced storytelling. as someone else wrote, best war movie i've seen in years...and while we're at it, best clint movie in a few outings, as well... i agree that the ending is a bit sudden. but there was no reason to drag it out, either... i don't feel it lingered on any one dynamic of what would be expected from a film like this...not TOO much violence or proselytizing/flag waving or lingering on casualty horrors... it doesn't, on the other hand, turn away from any of the ugliness, either... i thought bradley cooper did a great job in the role. the changes he gradually instilled into the character were subtle but present. it's as well done a war movie as i'll ever need."", 'Just look up the real Chris Kyle and his claims surrounding hurricane Katrina and the super dome . Than you might not see him as such a hero. An entertaining movie but a huge lie. Not to mention his ideology that all Iraqis were savages and his killings during this illegal invasion were all justified, even the ones on unarmed civilians.', ""Well first of, Bradley Coopers muscle-gain in this movie is amazing and it really is a good and moving performance on his part. This movie has both a love affair and the war drama you would expect from a movie about an American sniper, but neither really catches on. The part of the movie in between deployments doesn't really do anything for the story, and it really reduces the overall impression of this movie. It seems as though this part of the movie hasn't really received as big an effort as the parts when he is deployed in Iraq. The combat scenes are very convincing, they reminded me of Black Hawk Down, and you really can't put a finger on those parts. All in all this is a movie worth while seeing, and it will quite possibly demand an emotional reaction, but then it is soon forgotten. Maybe if i were American and had a sense of American patriotism, i would rate this movie a bit higher."", ""American sniper is probably one of the best war films I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. Now I would probably won't consider this a war film because it mostly focuses on one character. One of the most recent war films that I really enjoyed last year was Lone Survivor. Now I thought that movie was really good but it was just handle very overly dramatic. I think this is probably one of the best performances Bradley Cooper has given in his career. I also think this is Clint Eastwood's best movie he has directed since Gran Torino. The action scenes were handled very well and it felt real. One problem I had with the film were the supporting characters. Now the acting for them were good but it's just you never get to know most of them their just there for the main character. The story is mostly just learning about one character. There really isn't that much to say about this film but if your a fan of war films then I would highly recommend checking this film out."", ""Based on the IMDb ratings and reviews I was expecting more and came away a bit disappointed. The first half felt a little bit like army propaganda at times. This left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth and probably ruined the more realistic second half when they started to deal with the negative effects of war.Cooper did a really good job. He deserves props or his portrayal. However, I think this movie could have been much better if they didn't have to get sign off from the family and the army requiring them to portray the main character in a certain way. Also the ending just sucks and no way around that one.To summarize, it was OK but not at all Oscar worthy imho."", ""I really like Clint Eastwood movies and Mystic River is among my favorite ones.American Sniper is the story of an American sniper in Middle East war over several years. The movie is beautifully shot, but I really did not connect with the main character, nor the other ones. I prefed way better Black Hawk Dawn (Ridley Scott). What I really do not get is the patriotic ending, with real footage of his funeral parade.Why the sniper is considered a hero (ok he saved other soldier's lives) if he killed so many people?If you want to see a movie about war (not war movies) I suggest:Full Metal Jacket - The Thin Red Line"", 'What a terribly frustrating film. Here we have an elite American soldier who has headed out to Iraq, peered down a scope for days on end, and chosen 200 times that the unfortunate at the other end needed to die. A difficult subject deserving a nuanced treatment.The problem is that apart from some sighing and bowing of his head from time to time, Kyle seems unaffected by what he does, as is presumably essential to do this kind of work and not go insane. We have no idea about his character. So with the protagonist essentially a killing robot, it\'s left to the screenwriter and director to try to inject some depth, and there\'s plenty not go at.Why is he here? How is Iraq at fault for the embassy bombings and 9/11 which prompted him to march into the recruitment office? What\'s prompted a woman to push a grenade into her son\'s hands and send him off to run at a 50 tonne tank? Why have some of the residents of these towns decided to stay and have their front doors kicked in by Marines or have their kids\' limbs drilled to dust by the local militant sadist?But these are difficult questions, and there\'s no apparent appetite to touch on them.As pointed out by another reviewer, this is doubly depressing when you consider that this director produced one of the most harrowing shooting scene in any film, in ""Unforgiven"", where we hear a man die slowly over minutes while his killer agonises at his dying sobbing.Finally, I didn\'t need to see Kyle get shot at the end, so have no qualms with the choice to show this as a sober piece of text. The fact that we\'ve just seen dozens of people being wiped out through Kyle\'s scope does however leave me wondering if some of his victims\' deaths might also deserve a more downbeat depiction.So we\'re left with the tired old Stars and Stripes formula that\'s worked since time began. Western forces mowing down hordes of middle easterners. No doubt, this film needed to appeal to a certain home audience. As far as that\'s concerned, job done. I\'m off for a shower to rinse off the jingoism.', 'I honestly believe every American should see this film. If after viewing you aren\'t filled with a sober reverence and feelings of gratitude then shame on you. This is the quintessential film surrounding the war on terror from the point of view of those that served and even their families. I\'ve read a review by a former Navy Seal (Brent Gleeson) that says it best\x85 ""The way the film was directed coupled with outstanding performances by Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller and the rest of the cast made for a heart wrenching and deeply accurate portrayal of the external and internal battles our service men and women face. Not to mention the even greater sacrifices made by the families and loved ones back home."" I would rate it shear perfection had they spent more time with his recovery and angst driven road back once he was stateside. This is easily one of my top five films of the year.', ""Bradley Cooper stars as Chris Kyle, the most prolific sniper in American military history. It begins with the thirty year old Kyle as a cowboy type who is searching for meaning in his life when he becomes a navy seal. After rigorous training he is sent to Iraq and becomes a legendary sniper. The war scenes look very similar to Stanley Kubrick's often used ones in Full Metal Jacket. The camera tracks from behind the soldiers as they move forward. The action is fast paced and well done by director Clint Eastwood. The melodramatic family moments are fairly typical, with the suffering wife holding the home front while hubby keeps the world safe for democracy. I found Sierra Miller annoying as Kyle's spouse, but Cooper was cast right in the lead role. Although a bit too long at two hours and fifteen minutes, it is still one of the better films of 2014."", ""My Thoughts:You would think that we would get tired of these war movies depicting life over in Iraq and Afghanistan but when they come together in a movie this good it is easy to see why we keep coming back for more. This is easily one of Clint Eastwood's best directed movie. And then we come to Bradley Cooper, he has always been a face in Hollywood but I think this movie shows that he has some serious acting chops. I know he was a Hollywood A lister before but this movie shows that he is more than just a pretty face to look at when he is on screen. I would like to see him in more of these drama type roles. Even though I did like him as Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy.We follow Chris Kyle's life starting with a brief glimpse of how he grew up and what he did before joining the Navy and the SEALs. We then follow Chris through Basic Underwater Demolition/SEALs (BUDs) training. To him finding and marrying Taya (Sienna Miller). But what this movie really focuses on is the time Chris Kyle spends between four tours of duty in Iraq to the time spent between them at home. Chris seems to thrive while over in Iraq, he is in his element and knows what needs to get done. Chris is in a war between himself and an Iraqi Sniper that wants the glory of taking down the Legend that Chris Kyle has become over there. When at home though he is faced with a family he barely knows and trying to get reacquainted with them, too dealing with the mundane day to day life.I am sure there is some things that the movie doesn't portray correctly be it due to the missions still being classified or to wanting to protect some of those people that are still active and out there protecting us. But the movie does capture what it is to be a man going off to fight a war in another country and then trying to come home and dealing with not only with your day to day life but also trying to put behind the war. Luckily in this day and age Veterans do have avenues to get help and work through it. And Chris once he got his feet under him was an advocate of trying to help those returning Veterans get a hold on reality and get back to living that normal life they had before going of to war.This movie is an emotional roller-coaster and is going to take you on a journey. So be prepaid to have your heart strings pulled and maybe a Kleenex or two with you when you see this. Especially if you are like me and did not know Chris Kyle's story before seeing this movie.My Recommendation:A Must See."", ""The movies is about Chris Kyle's home life and military career with the US Navy as a SEAL sniper. The movie has some intense moments, containing violent and disturbing scenes. The movie doesn't portray Chris as a Rambo figure but rather a man that deals with the problems all soldiers have to face both overseas and at home. Clint Eastwood who is in his mid-eighties, shows us he still has it, directing an amazing film. The movie tells Kyle's story the way he told it in the first book. Overall, American Sniper is a great movie that has all the components, that make a movie great. For anyone who is a war film enthusiast, this is a movie for you. To those who call Chris Kyle a murderer and baby killer, I believe you fail to understand what soldiers sacrifice to protect our liberties and keep us free."", 'Fine movie (based on a real story) about a skilled and strong but broken hero and the price war takes on all sides. Good.', 'I have never done a film review before but after seeing American Sniper I thought i would share my views on what a brilliant film this is.American Sniper is a biopic about the ""legend"" Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper). Kyle starts the film as a wide boy cowboy, but then realises that he wants more from life and joins the American Seals. As this is happening he falls in love with his wife to be Taya ( Sienna Miller). This is where you start to see the beauty of the film develop. His love and passion for his country, and his endless-love for Taya is portrayed perfectly from Eastwood. Kyle ends up doing four tours in Iraq with over 1000 days in service, away from his wife, and the three children that came over the 5 years. Out in Iraq Kyle become known as a ""legend"" with his deadly aim with the sniper rifle. You see Kyle become ever close with his comrades. It was rumoured that the Taliban put a bounty on Kyles head of $180,000, you can only imagine how deadly his rifle was. After each tour you see Kyle with his family and you can see that Kyle is struggling to deal with civilisation, becoming very jumpy and hearing noises that he had in Iraq. This is shown in a few teary scenes between Taya and Kyle. Some very heart wrenching moments. This showed what any military personnel would go through when tore between love and duty of serving their country.The film ends with Kyle getting honourable discharged and starts to rebuild his life with Taya and the children. You can get the tissues out for the last scene!I am ashamed to say that I didn\'t know this was a true story before watching this film. This is news that should be heard worldwide, not the latest selfie taken by the Kardashians...', 'The movie itself is not bad, but when supposedly based on reality, the dishonesty leaves quite the sour taste. For example, in the movie, a clip of 9/11 is played to justify the war, but 9/11 had nothing to do with Iraq. Secondly, our sniper gets himself into a pickle when he is falsly accused of having shot someone only carrying the Koran, and not a weapon. I found this scene particuarly odd as Chris Kyle supposedly wanted to kill anyone with a Koran -- even if he says he didn\'t.The movie just shows a very heroic depiction, someone who only did what was necesary to save himself and his men, where as in the book, Chris wrote that he relished in killing and had a blast doing it: ""I only wish I had killed more,"" ""I loved what I did...it was fun. I had the time of my life.""']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Dick did not want to take that chance, so he wrote many many many short stories about the future of man and where we, as a society, were headed. Blade Runner, Total Recall, Paycheck, Screamers, and Minority Report are all short stories written by Dick about the future that have been turned into a movie, and most have a less than enthusiastic view of where we are headed. In Minority Report, we see the effects of predicting the future to the point of crimes are prevented by arresting murderers before they kill. If that does not appear logical, there is a quick little scene early in the movie that addresses those concerns, and on the surface makes sense. Tom Cruise plays the Washington, DC pre-crime chief, John Anderton, who runs the investigators who rely on 3 scientifically engineered beings who can see murders before they happen. The system, of course, raises civil liberty issues, but seems to work perfectly, that is until Anderton is fingered for a murder. The rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national after an election, played by Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg, Minority Report plays as both a ""Whodunnit?"" and a futuristic exercise of science fiction. Much time was spent on designing the Washington, DC of the 2050s, including cars that run on magnets, virtual reality stations, and much more throughout the film. The most interesting design is of the ""sick sticks"" used by cops to bring down criminals. The blueish tint given to the film also gives us a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the time we live in, another trait of a Dick story. A wonderful movie the works for both the crime buff and the science fiction fan.', ""I read a lot of previous posts about this movie. This is one of the best films of the year, and of recent years. This is a perfect blend of action, suspense, thrills and film-noir. The plot is intelligent and fresh. People saying it is not original must have slept through the movie. Tom Cruise is fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director. I'll agree, the ending was a little too happy, but not worth complaining about. This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may look like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive. The film creates many moral questions and issues, and should leave you thinking. Is being arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair? It is worth seeing again and again. As a film lover and critic, i can say it is one amazing movie."", ""This is spoken in Minority Report by a drug-dealer on the streets with no eyes at all, so I suppose its free advice for John Anderton, our hero, or a bit of wise-sounding advice meant to get across to the audience but with no other good place for it to fit in the film. This is fine with me, too, because Minority Report is such a taut futuristic thriller that an incongruous little bit of wisdom like this is not to have any negative impact on the film as a whole. John Anderton, played with precision by the great Tom Cruise (oh shut up, the man's awesome), is the chief of the Pre-Crime department in the District of Columbia, which has successfully eradicated murder entirely for the last six years. He works with a group of `pre-cogs' that, together, dream of murders that have not yet taken place and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening before they happen. This is obviously a formula for a highly successful action movie, but the thing that really makes Minority Report succeed is that it pays so much amount of attention to things that would occur in this situation in real life. It is explained very early in the film that the invention of Pre-Crime has eradicated premeditated murder, as this is most easily detected by the pre-cogs. The majority of the `business,' then, of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia, are crimes of passion. This not only provides the possibility of a lot more tension in that these crimes leave a lot less time for prevention, but also avoids complicating the plot with the details of premeditated murders. We don't care about a guy who wronged another guy five years ago or drug deals gone bad, all we need to hear about are a guy who comes home to find his wife in bed with another man and loses control.\nGiven the fact that the movie involves some sort of time-travel (even if information is the only thing traveling through time), it leaves itself open to criticism about plot holes. This is obvious, because plot holes like this even permeated the unparalleled Back to the Future series, which obviously had plenty of plot holes but handled them spectacularly well. Given the amount of movies that I have seen that involve time travel, I have come up with this equation: Time Travel = Plot Holes. This is a universal equation that is never escaped, but it does not mean that any movie that involves time travel will be brought down by the subsequent and unavoidable plot holes. Minority Report did not suffer from its necessary plot holes and neither did the timeless Back to the Future series (which has FINALLY been released as a complete set and which no respectable movie collection could possibly be without). My esteemed colleague and close friend Christopher Brown (see his brilliant reviews at http://us.imdb.com/CommentsAuthor?625436) points out one of these plot holes in his review of Minority Report, but makes the mistake of suggesting that, given the nature of the precognition and of the crime itself, Anderton's murder should never have been predicted since it did not entail premeditation. Sorry, Chris, but you've missed the boat on this one. The only thing that this does is bring up the fact that it's impossible to tell where precognition starts. It could be argued perfectly well that the pre-cogs played a part in their own precognition. They predicted that Anderton would commit the murder under the circumstances that he would have been watching the thoughts of the pre-cogs and seen that he would commit murder, and then obviously sought to find out for himself how he could have been expected to commit a murder against a person he has never heard of. In this case, if he had called in sick that day, all of this would have been avoided. But he's the best at what he does, he has personal reasons for wanting to stop murder, he does not slack off, he does not call in sick. John Anderton was predicted by the pre-cogs to commit murder because he was at work that day. The action in the film comes from the possibility that the whole prediction of Anderton's murder might be what is called a `minority report,' where the pre-cogs disagree on something that is going to happen. If he can prove that only one of the pre-cogs came up with the vision that he was going to commit a murder, it might cancel out the entire prediction because it is unreliable. On the way to this goal, we are presented with everything from a tremendously dedicated investigator (played brilliantly by Colin Farrell) to some amazingly creepy but strangely accepted identification spiders that scan John's implanted eye in one of the more uncomfortable scenes in the film. Minority Report is one of the best and most unique thrillers to be released in years. It is the conglomeration of such a dizzying array of films that it is difficult to contemplate them all at once. We see elements of action films, futuristic thrillers, crime films, science fiction, and of course, the influence of Stanley Kubrick is never far off. There is even, especially in the later portion of the film, a heavy influence on the soundtrack by Bernard Herrman, who was the composer for most of Alfred Hitchcock's films, among many others. It's always nice to see such a respectful homage like that, and it is only one of the many things that makes Minority Report yet another addition to Steven Spielberg's extensive list of high-end films (the last of which was the spectacular A.I.). The only thing I can think of that holds Minority Report back from joining Spielberg's list of timeless classics is that it does not have the scope as far as its target audience as such films as E.T. and Jurassic Park. However, despite not having quite as large of a target audience, Minority Report stands as a strong entry in Spielberg's growing list of great films."", 'This film is worth watching for lots of reasons. The best is Philip K. Dick\'s dystopian vision.

This one tops my list of those.Love it!', 'One of the first films to tap into the anti-authoritarian aspects of the Citizen\'s Band (CB) radio craze, ""Smokey"" is basically a movie-length car chase and a pleasantly insipid slice of late-\'70\'s Americana.The tissue-thin plot has good ole boy pals The Bandit (Reynolds) and Cletus (a surprisingly good Jerry Reed) running a load of Coors cross-country on a tight deadline while trying to avoid an assortment of less-than-bright cops, led by pompous blowhard Buford T.

Avoid the two vastly inferior sequels.', ""This is a classic, and is one of the funniest movies of its day, nothing new can compare. It was fun beginning to end, meant as light time filler.

Followed by two sequels."", 'When this movie came out, it became the biggest movie in America until Star Wars took over during that summer. Like Star Wars, each installment of the original trilogy was released the same year as the other original trilogy, with each movie grossing less than the original. Unlike star wars, no more sequels were made and the rest is history.', 'As a modern viewer, it\'s really confusing, to see an alcohol bootlegging movie, come out in the 1970s, that wasn\'t based in ""prohibition era"" America. However, that\'s not really a fault of the film. It makes the film, a little more unique. Made during the Convey Craze of the late 1970s. Smokey & the Bandit reeks of that era cheese. That doesn\'t make it, a bad movie. It just a little dated. A lot of the Citizens band radio (CB radio) lingo and slangs, really goes, over my head. It\'s also kinda disturbing to see the main character risk innocent driver\'s lives on the road, for alcohol and to see random people helping him, escape from the police. Despite that, for the most part, the film was very entertaining, even if everything in the film is so over-the-top. Directed by Hal Needham, the movie tells the story of a bootlegger runner, named Bo \'Bandit\' Darville (Burt Reynolds), whom is hired to run a tractor trailer full of beer over county lines. However, he has one big problem, he\'s always being pursuit by foul-mounted, determinate, Texan Sheriff, Buford T.

Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this film is a bit disappointing when it comes to how it over-praise Coors Beer. It felt more like a product placement commercial, than a well-rounded movie. Trust me, Coors Beers wasn\'t as popular, as what this movie made it seem to be. While, its truth, that many Americans in the East Coast wasn\'t able to get Coors, due to the item not able to be legally sold, east of the Mississippi. However, in truth, Coors wasn\'t that popular, to Eastern Americans, at the time, due to how they treat their workers, during the labor strike of 1976/1977 & also the fact, that beer was only sold regional, so many people never try it over other products. Added to the fact, that Coors wouldn\'t go nationwide distribution in the United States until the mid-1980. It\'s only the seventh most popular beer at the U.S. Not number one, like this movie, makes it out to be. One thing, that was popular at the time, was car chase movies. After all, the 1970s would be describe, as the last great era of the America muscle cars. Add to the fact, that the 1st oil crisis, ended years ago, in 1973, and the fact that the next one isn\'t until 1979. You would see, a few of these cars, speed, back in the day. While, the stunts in this film doesn\'t seem, too dangerous or impressive to today\'s viewers. Compare to the CGI ridden car chase movies of today, this movie has a lot more realistic in its stunt work. In my opinion, it was alright for the most part. Nevertheless, the best thing about this movie, has to be the comedy and the characters. Burt Reynolds really does stand out in this film as the Bandit. I can\'t see, anybody else, playing, this rugged, wisecracking, Southern-type ""good olé\' boy, besides him. This movie really help his career, as it lead to many car comedies for him, such as 1981\'s Cannonball Run. I also love Jackie Gleason in this film. He\'s by far, the second best in this film. I love that he was given free rein to ad-lib dialogue and make suggestions. Most of the best laughs came from him. Two characters that I felt was a bit disappointing, was Sally Fields as Frog AKA Carrie and Jerry Reed as Cletus Snow. I wouldn\'t say, their roles was really memorable. However, Sally Fields does have chemistry with Burt Reynolds to the point that they dated after this film was made. Despite that, most of their scenes, felt a bit, too time-wasting. I really can\'t believe that they were able to catch up with Snowman\'s truck, at all, or be around each other, to the point, that they can still hear, each other in CB radio. You would think, they wouldn\'t be, able to make it, due to how long, the lake scene was. While, Jerry Reed\'s acting was mediocre, at best. Jerry Reed\'s performance of theme music, ""East Bound and Down"", was catchy. Even, if the lyrics of the song, seem low brow, and bit simpleton. I also love the fact, that this movie help influence the 1979–85 TV series \'The Dukes of Hazzard\', sharing many identical settings and concepts. In the end, this movie was good enough to include two sequels, 1980\'s Smokey and the Bandit II, and 1983\'s Smokey and the Bandit Part 3. None of them, as good as the original. Then, there was also a series of 1994 television films (Bandit Goes Country, Bandit Bandit, Beauty and the Bandit, and Bandit\'s Silver Angel) from original director/writer Hal Needham loosely based on the earlier version, with actor Brian Bloom now playing Bandit";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I could watch them ride around in a car for an hour anytime.It was the last third of the film where the action was ramped with some fantastic stunt work by badass Zoe Bell and, of course, the coup de grâce, Abernathy's boot in Stuntman Mike's (Kurt Russell) face.

Especially since they get much more time develop. The first crew is shown going about there day and hanging out in a bar. The second group gets some dialogue, we learn one of them has a gun, then we abandon one of those characters and enter a fun yet predictable climax.I think you can enjoy this film without knowledge of what it tries to parody, but it immediately becomes a much better and more rewatchable film when you have insight. I give this film a 6/10."", ""I enjoyed this movie. I don't mind all the dialog. I'm not really into car chases, but the stunts were impressive. Most of the movie is girls hanging out.

However, what Doctor Strange did was more than perfectly done, it's about the most craziest imagination that anyone had ever done in movie industry up to date."", 'Personally, I find that every time I watch ""Doctor Strange,"" I enjoy it slightly more than I did before. I suppose it comes down to my belief that ""Doctor Strange"" is far more rooted in reality than many other Marvel movies. Whereas many others have storylines that audiences and humanity in general cannot exactly relate to, ""Doctor Strange"" (simply put) follows a man who loses his way. After a bad car accident, Dr. Stephen Strange finds that he is unable to continue his work as a surgeon, and essentially spirals into despair. He eventually finds salvation in the mystic arts, finally understanding that the world does not revolve around him and becoming involved in a battle to save Earth. In terms of Marvel stories, that is fairly simplistic.Let me make myself clear: ""Doctor Strange"" is in no way a simple movie. Many scenes (especially those in the mirror dimension) are some of the trippiest scenes to ever grace a Marvel title. We\'re talking ""Inception""-level chaos. What I mean is that the story itself is fairly simplistic, which allows audiences to sympathize with Strange. Almost everyone has had or will have a crisis of faith. It\'s something we can understand, and I think that makes ""Doctor Strange"" a very solid film.On another note, the characters and cast in this movie are spot-on. Benedict Cumberbatch is literally PERFECT at being an arrogant neurosurgeon-turned Master of the Mystic Arts, Rachel McAdams is perfect as the down-to-Earth and often extremely confused Christine, and Benedict Wong is wonderful as... Wong. Huh. I never noticed they had the same name. Anyways, they\'re all hilarious in some way. Tilda Swinton (The Ancient One) and Mads Mikkelsen (Kaecilius) are more serious in tone, but both still have marvelous performances. I won\'t really mention Mordo, because he\'s a little annoying (even though I suppose that\'s purposeful). Chiwetel Ejiofor still does a great job of playing him though.So overall, I really enjoy ""Doctor Strange"" nowadays. I suppose its more realistic approach to characters was a little off-putting to me at first, but I think I\'ve warmed up to it.', 'I was not prepared for the visuals this movie offered. Nevertheless, I absorbed it in its full glory. It was easy to enjoy this movie not only because of its visuals but also because of the quirkiness and lovable characters. A must-watch!', ""Doctor Strange follows a surgeon who, after suffering from a major injury, sets out to search for healing. Instead, he ends up learning about magic.The movie opens with a scene that is both darker and funnier than most Marvel superhero movies I've seen. It sets the tone really well, and it actually manages to carry that all the way through. It is comedic, yet it maintains a level of urgency or threat to the entire situation that the characters constantly find themselves in, keeping the audience intrigued for most the entire duration.The special effects were probably the biggest selling point for this movie. For me, anyway. I made a point of getting it on blu-ray, and it paid off. The effects are pretty trippy (for lack of a better word), and that's really all I'm going to say about them. I wasn't sure they always made sense in the context of the movie, but they were still pretty cool.Unlike other Marvel superhero movies I've seen recently, this one is actually funny. The character of Stephen Strange is actually fleshed-out and realistic to an extent. He's an engaging character with plenty of faults and just as much charm. He's a fun character, and I get the feeling Eggs Benedict Cucumberpatch felt the same. In fact, basically the entire cast seems to be having a jolly ol' time making the movie. There's just this air of fun surrounding it.The writing is actually pretty good, with dialogue that comes expected of a particular character, and a plot driven in a direction that makes sense and ceases to be boring. I never found myself questioning a character's decisions due to pure stupidity, nor did I find myself dozing like I have through the last few movies. It manages to build an intriguing world without revealing too much or boring the audience with lore and exposition, yet it gives us just enough to keep us interested.Overall Doctor Strange is both fun and funny, clever and pretty, well acted and well-written, and is just an all-around great movie. It's a step in the right direction for Marvel, and I'm hoping to see them continue in this direction. In the end I would recommend this movie."", ""I actually really enjoyed this film. It was very entertaining, and a good way to spend two hours. Benedict Cumberbatch was good, the background of his character was very unique and interesting, and the other characters were complex and somewhat relatable. However, this movie had many flaws.Firstly, the storyline. Now, the backstory for Dr. Strange was very interesting, however, it was after he stopped being a surgeon when things began to get odd. It is all too common for movies to not explain their stories, because there are, 'things you don't understand.' However, in movies such as The Matrix, that line is used to evoke mystery and keep the audience engaged. I found that in this particular film, this was a tactic used by the writers to not have to explain their own story that they wrote. It gave me the feeling that they conjured up a great storyline for a great film, but they were unable to think of what the characters were actually doing in the film. It was not really explained what the characters were doing, it was just all of a sudden, Dr. Strange could conjure up a gold weapon and they had to fight people who wanted to ruin the world for no particular reason, and ended up concluding the film using time travel, another tactic used for easy endings.Now I am all for time travel movies. Films like Back to the Future are some of my favourite films of all time, but time in this film does not work for me. Time can be used to solve all of film's plot issues, and does not require any creativity to do so. I just felt that the messing with time in this film was not done cleverly, it was simply done to conclude a complex plot.Overall, I did enjoy this film. It had some good elements such as the backstory and acting. However, I felt the storyline could use work, which would have made the film an 8 out of 10."", ""POSITIVES:1) The cast is incredibly impressive and they all give amazing performances, for example I loved the fractured relationships that they are able to portray between the Order and the Zealots\n2) The fight / action scenes are very well shot and choreographed and are able to occur in a way that doesn't feel silly\n3) I thought the film did a very good job of world building and establishing lore - the conflict between the Ancient One and her relationship with The Dark Dimension was particularly engaging\n4) The humour is a lot less 'in your face' that most MCU films and that made it land a lot more for me\n5) The film stands on its own rather than relying on the other MCU filmsNEGATIVES:1) Not really this film's fault, but when there are powers like this that exist in the MCU, it makes people like Hawkeye and Black Widow just seem ridiculously weak\n2) There are times where the film almost feels like it has too many characters that it is trying to flesh out";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Feels to me like this could have developed into more than one movie but they crammed everything into one. Plenty of things left unexplained (from plot to characters).', '""This is the most painful score I\'ve ever had to give a movie. Yeah, I know, an 8/10 seems like it\'s rather high, but future me, I hope you realize how much you loved the Chaos Walking trilogy, and understand why this score seems so low to you. This should have been a 10/10. It\'s a fantastic concept for a movie that fails because everybody gave up. This movie took 9 years to complete, starting with a script from Charlie Kaufman back in 2012, which I\'m sure was better than what we ended up with. When the film was originally completed in 2017, it was met with horrible reviews from test screenings. My theory is that this movie stayed faithful to its book counterpart, The Knife of Never Letting Go, and ended with Mayor Prentiss taking over the town of Haven. 4 years later, we get a different ending. Mayor Prentiss falls down a hole, Aaron the Preacher burns to death (?? it was very confusing), we never learn the fate of Davy, and Todd wakes up on a ship from the new settlers with Viola, seemingly continuing on with their lives. The biggest change in the whole book comes from the fact that the ship arrived early, however, there are no people seen on the ship. I absolutely hate that this movie will never get a sequel, because ALL of these changes could be resolved with a second film. But without a second movie, we are left with an ending that is far too open to interpretation and a series of totally missed character developments, especially from the relationship between Todd and Davy. Anyways, I just read the script written by Charlie Kaufman, and oh my god, if the movie was this, it would be my favorite film of all time. I can understand the change of the ending, because if it ended in the hopeless way that the book did, it would be extremely disappointing. Like any book adaptation, this one has several changes from the books, and many of them are actually pretty good additions, but there are a few glaring changes. Let me go through them one by one. Firstly, the animals don\'t speak. This proposes some real problems with Manchee, because his death (which surprisingly is still in the movie) is much less impactful, and is only as effective as """"awe I hate when cute puppies die"""". Secondly, Todd does not have nearly as good of a relationship with the Mayor as he\'s initially portrayed to. His feelings are much more complicated in the books, and it\'s a strange interpretation to make the Mayor this father figure for Todd when that\'s never what he was. Thirdly, Wilf and his scene are missing from this movie. Why? I don\'t really know. I remember reading the Wikipedia for this movie for months and seeing that Wilf was cast, but he seems to have been cut last second. Fourthly, the Spackle are underutilized. They only appear as semi-antagonists for a very short amount of time, and they skip to the scene where he attacks (in the book also killing) one of the Spackle, but then they NEVER appear. This was a very odd choice to me. Fifthly, there was a lot of missed opportunity with Aaron\'s death as well, because this was a fundamental scene for Todd and his """"I am not a killer"""" mentality that is core to his character.This all being said, there is actually a lot I seriously love about this movie. Firstly, the production design and music are absolutely fantastic, and there are some absolutely wonderful scenes that take place throughout this film. The first 90 minutes or so are absolutely a 10/10 from me. I love the romantic connection that Todd and Viola build, and I think there are plenty of hilarious scenes between the two of them. I\'ve never been so happy at a movie before, and if the movie had kept this up until the very ending, it would have been my favorite movie of all time. I love the scene of Viola and Todd talking in the rain, because it\'s just so beautiful. The absence of Wilf\'s scene with the creatures described as the most beautiful Todd could even imagine might be missing, but there are some genuinely beautiful shots that I just fell in love with. Tom Holland getting butt ass naked was hilarious, and him and Daisy Ridley just have great chemistry in this film.Now why is this movie going to fail? Well, first of all, because of the 5 reasons I mentioned above. It\'s a critical failure right now, but that could be solved if it gets a second movie. Everything could be wrapped up by a sequel (or two), and it makes me wish that this was a limited series instead, with 15 episodes covering all three of the books. Anyways, what the hell happened to the marketing of this film? Tom Holland (the star), Doug Liman (the director), and Lionsgate (the production company), all just gave up on the film. There was no marketing from any of them, and poor Daisy Ridley was left with all of the marketing, so the movie probably won\'t make anywhere near its budget back at the box office. I want this movie to do well there, because if it does, then we could possibly have a second film, and I would bump this rating up so fast. Until then, I\'m left with a hole in my heart, and I feel absolutely defeated by this film. I\'m disappointed as hell, but I can\'t wait to finish Monsters of Men (the third and final book in the series). Chaos Walking was my most anticipated movie of all time, and with it releasing, I feel strangely empty now. I guess that\'s life.""', ""From the trailers this film looked pretty good, but upon watching it the film turned out to be pretty good in a much different way. At first it seems to be about a film where all of the women on the planet have died while the men have developed telepathic adbilities, however once you get to the middle of the film you suddenly realise that there is actually much more to the story than meets the eye. For instance, they suggest that the reason all of the women were killed was because of an alien race on the planet, but that sort of turns out not to be the case.The film is about this girl who survives this pod that lands on the planet and she has lost contact with the colony ship that is orbiting it. The suggestion is that if she doesn't contact them, then they will leave and go and look for another planet. Another thing about this ship is that it is a generation ship, meaning that she was born, and grew up, on the ship.This film, and in turn the book, deals with some quite important issues, and it is quite ironic that the film was released this week with all the stuff going on in the Australian Parliament. One thing that the film touches upon, as opposed to really exploring, is the idea of colonialism, and how the colonists respond to the inhabitants of this world. In fact, it is interesting how the protagonist, Todd, is convinced that the inhabitants are actually bad, and because he knows no difference, then he doesn't question it.In fact, the film is set initially in a small colonial town, and all he knows is what he is told. In fact, later in the film it is revealed that he thought that this town was the only town in existence on the planet, namely because nobody actually told him otherwise. Of course, there is also the fact that he has never seen a women, with the exception of Viola.I notice that a lot of people really didn't like this film, and in a way it sort of doesn't surprise me because, well, it is pretty confronting in parts, especially when it comes to the idea of gender relations. I don't want to say too much because it will give away the plot, however, I certainly did appreciate the issues that were explored. Okay, I sort of could see the twist, and it was fairly predictable, however, the concepts that this film explores are concepts that we really can't let go away."", '$125 million, dozens of rewrites and reshoots, tons of star power, and it hits the ground like wet cheese.', ""This was filmed in 2017.

Mads, Tom and Demian are all good, despite only getting glimpses of the latter. The whole things comes together alright but it\'s just not well done enough to warrant a higher score. Daisy Ridley puts in another mannequin like performance, and she is carried like luggage by Tom for most of the film. She just doesn\'t have ""it"". Honesty, I\'ve seen CGI characters with more range. It\'s ok but that\'s about all.', ""Haha Tom Holland being a hormonal boy in this movie. In a dystopian world, young boy Todd lived in a colony with only men, and these men were plagued with the Noise, where all their internal thoughts were unfiltered and leaked out that others can hear. One day, a girl came down from space, met the colony, and stuff happened.What I enjoyed the most was the unique premise. The boy Todd, played by Tom Holland, could not control his Noise around the girl, played by Daisy Ridley, and it gave for some funny and cringe moments.And yeah, that's pretty much what I liked about the movie. Despite the premise, the movie went for a predictable and formulaic plot that was pretty boring for the majority of the runtime. The characters were straightforward and had little background that can make me invested in them. The cast was pretty strong, but the script didn't give them enough to shine.Also, there were major plot points that were ignored. The ending didn't make it look like there's gonna be any sequel, so I guess I won't know much about those plots.This movie would honestly be better as a TV series like The 100. It somehow felt rushed and empty as a 2 hour movie.Overall, a movie with potential but was wasted with mediocre plot and characters. It's not chaotically good, but chaotically boring. No point watching this movie. 4/10.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These idiots kidnapped and tortured this man until he gave up everything he owned. The actual account is significantly more chilling than depicted in the movie. The only embellishment seemed to be the stupidity of the villains. In actuality, it was their arrogance and hubris that got them caught.', ""Watching Pain&Gain today I was thinking that this film could have been handled as a straight drama. But given the absolutely preposterous nature of this true story I think playing it as a black comedy was the only way to go.The film reminded me a whole lot of Fargo with a bit of Casino and Goodfellas thrown in. Three bodybuilders who become jealous and resentful of the wealthy clients they have at a health club they work at conceive of a plan to rob one they truly think is an obnoxious rich fool. That client Tony Shalhoub is just that is besides the point, these guys are like the hired criminals in Fargo and everything that can go wrong does. This film is exponential Murphy's Law. And Shalhoub proves to be tougher than these he men can imagine.The three muscle bound Moriartys are Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie. Their back stories are provided with their own narration as Scorsese did in his crime classics, but these guys have results like Fargo though not at first. Their own weaknesses in the end defeat them.Pain&Gain is laced with humor with a dash of pathos in as far as the criminal masterminds are concerned. They've sculpted themselves into the bodies beautiful and such Adonis/Apollo features deserve the best that life can offer. They think some cosmic joke is being played on them that an arrogant little worm like Tony Shalhoub should have so much wealth with all the big boy toys he can possess because of same. So Wahlberg, Mackie, and Johnson resolve to fix things as a matter of justice and entitlement. I think if you have a quirky and bizarre sense of humor and a jaundiced view of life, you'll go for Pain&Gain."", 'Pain & Gain honestly has too many flaws to name, but for some reason I think this is a pleasure to watch. It can be extremely funny and entertaining. Especially if you are into fitness than this movie is for you.', 'Movie review:Does the Rock appear in every movie throughout the summer? Anyway this movie is based on a true story which makes it that much better when you see it. Reason for this? These ""criminals"" have to be the dumbest people in the world. The story revolves around 3 fitness trainers or muscleheads that decide they want the better things in life. Well, of course, the best way to get them is to steal it. The mastermind to this is Danny Lugo (played by Mark Wahlberg who again is great) who concocts a scheme to kidnap one of the clients of the club (Tony Shalhoub), and extort his millions. So he recruits Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and Paul (Dwayne Johnson) to exact this brilliant plan. I would dive into the plan, but I really don\'t think there was one. That is the beauty of the genius of the plan. They said ""screw it, let\'s wing it"" and since they are aforementioned idiots, this leads to some extremely funny moments. The movie itself is not action, but more of a comedy that just shows how dumb people are. So let\'s just say they painstakingly achieve their goal and score the money, but that is only half of it. In their own ways, one score wasn\'t enough due to their various eccentric behaviors and now a new plot is hatched, which you would think after the first plans failure (barring getting the money) they may have learned they are not cut out for this. There are plenty of little side plots in the story that when the movie sums them up for you in court, you will be just listening to the account of this heist and just plain out laugh, not even realizing you just saw it in the past two hours of viewing. The characters work so well off of each other that the humor comes fairly quick, yet subtle. This is all put together very well into a fine flick that delivers the laughs. I was impressed that Michael Bay pulled this off since he isn\'t known for comedy. Set in the 90s and in Miami, the look is just what you would expect, fluorescent colors, jean shorts, etc. all are abound. A very comedic look at a violent yet amusing crime that actually happened. I would love to know just how accurate this movie is, because it just seems so over the top on how stupid the characters were. Oh, one thing I noticed that I am unsure how this fits into the criminals lifestyles and is more used for humor:An obsession with the male sex organ, real and fake, the subject comes up a lot. All and all, an enjoyable movie and the Rock once again steals the show with his g-d fearing coke head character that will just keep you laughing. 6.6/10 IMDb 6.9 I personally think it was just a bit too long, but that is OK. Bonus for wrestling fans, look closely for a Kurt Angle sighting in this movie.', ""The overwhelming sense I get from all the negative reviews on here is that the comedy in this true story is irresponsible and wrong. Well I think that's just a couple prunes trying to ruin a really good movie. I don't think Michael Bay set out or achieved any disrespect towards the victims. The absurd details of this case mixed with the excellent acting of the principal three actors create an extremely enjoyable movie with some laughs here and there. The editing is excellent and this movie should be rated at least a 7.1\nOne of the best if not the best movie Mr. Michael Bay has made. It deserves more credit."", ""I'm not sure what Hollywood is on lately, but this films just goes to prove that there is truly nothing good coming out of that hell-hole lately.Director Michael Bay, the producers and actors should all be ASHAMED of themselves for creating a film which attempts to bring humor and raise sympathy for a group of kidnappers, torturers, robbers and ultimately murderers. WTF were you guys thinking! This group of idiots were guilty of heinous acts and yet you produce a film that makes lite of them and their atrocious crimes. If this had happened to someone you loved would you still make the same movie or be involved with this trash? I doubt it.If you want to know more about what these criminals did, read the Miami New Times 3 part series by the same name of this film or the book by Marc Shiller (the sole survivor).I will never spend a dime on any film which any of these actors, producers or directors are involved with. It may not mean anything to them, but at least I have my self respect."", 'I love some of Bay\'s other directed films like ""The Rock"" and ""Bad Boys"", and this is obviously WAY different. Yes the directing style is similar, language similar, actors similar (Fiennes and Harris), locale somewhat similar (many of Bays films are filmed in Miami), but the flow and feel of the film is much different. This is based on a true story, and the focus is not as much about the action as it is about Bay\'s stylish comedic way to tell this story. I did not particularly care for this way. The excessive profanity and mockery of Christianity and religion were a bit annoying for me";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the style of several classic film genres from several countries, if the pursuit of ultra-violent and vicious vendetta with serious loss of blood and body parts is your thing, then you've come to the right place. Also contains great dialogue."", ""When I first heard that this film was going to be split into two movies instead of being presented as one as originally planned, I was angry. I accused the powers that be of trying to squeeze two box office triumphs out of a single project. But after having seen both 'Kill Bill' and 'Kill Bill Vol.2', I am glad because both films are extremely different even though the stories are tied together with primarily the same actors and having the same director. Containing less action than 'Kill Bill', volume 2 is intelligent, bizarre and extremely engrossing. It absorbs all of its elements equally and David Carradine's performance as Bill is the best thing to happen in movie villain history since, well, I'll leave that up to individual interpretation."", 'Although, as a film buff myself, having a whole Kill Bill epic in one sitting would\'ve been satisfying, like the first part that was split Vol. 2 works extraordinarily well. In terms of storytelling it\'s direct and (of course) unconventional, in style Tarantino pays homage/borrows (or depending on your point of view steals) from most of the films that stew around in his arsenal. And with dialog, in maybe a couple of moments it doesn\'t seem up to par, but it\'s not often. And the acting is in the greatest tradition of B-movie, spaghetti western, shaw-brothers, kung-fu et. all. If you look at both Kill Bills it\'s fascinating as a movie buff to discover things you haven\'t seen before (i.e. the whole blood-coated style of the climax in vol. 1) and things you recognize right away (i.e. the unmistakable songs of Ennio Morricone, who is just as creditable as Leone for Tarantino\'s style).What\'s there to say about the story, except that it picks up where it left off? Sort of- as usual, the non-linear story aspect kicks in, and two sections of the film derail from the continuing story of revenge on the DIVAs and Bill (the squad members this time being the perfectly paced in tone and presence Michael Madsen as Budd, and Daryl Hannah\'s most vindictive role as Elle Driver). At first, we get a stark, black and white view of what the ""Massacre at Two Pines"" was like, and right away we\'re introduced (finally) to Bill, played by David Carradine, one of the most calm, affecting film villain performances in recent memory. The other derailment is to tell the immensely entertaining story of The Bride\'s training by the heavy-duty Pai Mei (Gordon Liu, in one of his performances in the whole KB saga). This could be counted as the funnest part of the film, aside from a few key moments, as the camera sweeps from medium to close up happen every thirty seconds or so. In the acting department, as I\'ve said, Tarantino gets a big boost- this could be counted as being one of the key performances of not only Carradine\'s career, but Thruman\'s as well. They elevate the mood of Tarantino\'s (sometimes) tongue-in-cheek dialog, but they\'re also pro\'s that do their best when it comes time to the showdown, with monologues that come close to being QT\'s most memorable (although not his best- as cool as it all sounds, it doesn\'t hit the Pulp Fiction marker). When it does end, the whole operatic sense of the film seems to work, and to the audience it will either be a fitting end or a disappointment. It is, at least, the most ambitious action/comedy/drama/kung-fu/western/romance film (this is referring to Vol. and both volumes together) in many a moon";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"[""I love this movie so much. The first time I watched it with a friend, we jumped back in the movie so many times to rewatch all our favourite parts over and over again.\nI've watched it a couple of times, and I still like it so so much. I've always liked spy movies. Growing up watching Bond. This movie is fun and clever and it's just a great movie. I might just go and rewatch it right now actually.Yes, I know this review is stupid positive. But when you find a movie that you can enjoy without finding any big mistakes or things you get annoyed about, you just have to feel happy."", 'I had heard of the 60\'s television show ""The Man from UNCLE"", but like most of us under the age of 60, never got the chance to see an episode. I know, I know, there have been countless re-runs, it just never grabbed my attention. All I could go on were the words from my wise mother who stated, ""I used to watch that show when I was a kid back in the 60\'s. It starred.....oh what\'s his name.....Robert Vaughan."" She couldn\'t remember the other actor that starred along side Vaughan but I was guessing she was just thrilled to have something from her childhood reborn into the 21st Century.Let me start by saying, this is a good movie. The star of the show is undoubtedly the director, Guy Ritchie and like most film buffs, was more curious than excited about U.N.C.L.E.\'s arrival. I was curious to see what Ritchie could do with a television program that has been dead and buried for over fifty years. Was he going to modernise it for the 21st century? Was it going to be a serious take on the lighted-hearted spy genre? Who was going to be in it? I am really glad I am getting the chance to review one of Guy Ritchie\'s films because I am a fan. I enjoyed Sherlock Holmes and his gritty London underground films but was I going to enjoy this. He seems to be the go to director when Hollywood needs a relic dug up and brought back to life.Guy Ritchie\'s trademark is everywhere on this film, from the stylish sets, to the retro fashion. The catchy score, the swagger, and the witty banter, all are part of the Guy Ritchie experience. His ability to take the audience back to the 1960\'s was a master stroke and will keep UNCLE unique when compared to the many other spy franchises that hit our cinema screens all too often. Ritchie was able to find the right balance of subtle amusement, keeping true to the television show, without making it into an obvious comedic sketch. It was an entertaining, fun ride that engrossed the audience from start to finish with enough action to keep the doubters glued to the screen.We are introduced to the two protagonists, CIA agent, Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) and KGB operative, Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), who team up against their wishes to foil the attempts of a mysterious organisation to produce and profit from nuclear weapons. Set to the backdrop of the Cold War, the two secret agents must rely on the daughter of a German Scientist, Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander) to infiltrate the organisation. But is she more than just a mechanic? The three stars are evenly matched throughout the film, each getting their chance to shine in the spotlight but if there is a standout performance it would have to be Ms Vikander who dazzles in a mesmerizing array of 1960\'s fashion. She looks the part and plays the part perfectly of a seemingly innocent and sweet young woman tangled up in the world of espionage.Guy Ritchie has taken a gamble on his two leading men with both heavily criticised in recent big budget roles but it pays off as Cavill and Hammer look comfortable in their roles with neither outshining the other. The two agents continually strive for superiority, mimicking their own countries need for supremacy in the volatile world of the 1960\'s. Hammer\'s short tempered psychopath is perfectly balanced to the cool, slick ladies man of Cavill. Elisabeth Debicki is chilling and cold as the she-devil villain and the big goof, Hugh Grant is used to perfection by Ritchie who gives him a nice cameo. Grant adds a bit of star recognition to the film but comes across as rather likable with well timed appearances.This is a film to be enjoyed for what it is.....a fun ride. Taking it too seriously will damage the experience.', ""From the soundtrack, to the settings, costumes, characters, and action, the man from UNCLE is an exciting and classy action movie. It takes the bond formula and recreates it through Guy Richie's unmistakable lens.I honestly think Napoleon Solo (one of the main characters, an American Spy) was a perfect role for Henry Cavill, who knocked it out of the park... an Archer-esque, suave, witty charmer/womanizer. The same can be said of Armie Hammer and Alicia Vikander's charactersThis is a witty, lighthearted, and funny movie and seriously underrated. It is definitely a go-to relax and enjoy movie for me"", ""In the early 1960s right after the Cold War started CIA agent Solo (Henry Cavill) and KGB agent Illya (Armie Hammer) have to work together to find a kidnapped scientist who can make a nuclear warhead. Helping them is the scientist's daughter Gaby (Alicia Vikander). They also get involved with the beautiful but deadly Victoria (Elizabeth Debicki).Updating of a 1960s TV series which I never saw. It's well-done with some cool action sequences and fairly tame violence (except for the end). Cool use of split scenes during some of the action too. They capture the early 60s fashions, cars and architecture perfectly. This film is VERY colorful. The acting is mostly good. Cavill is suave and very fun as Solo. On the negative side the plot is overly convoluted--a LOT is thrown at you at the beginning. There are at least three endings also--two too many. Worst of all is Hammer--he's TERRIBLE in his role. Very wooden and unconvincing. Still I was never bored and enjoyed it. So I marginally recommend it."", ""Great film, can't lose cast, what the heck is the hold up?! It's a franchise waiting to happen."", ""The sets, scenery and wardrobes are beautiful. The movie was a disappointment. It was so stylized that it quickly became boring. To me, there was no real excitement to the action sequences. Everything was shallow including the villains, the heroes and the plot. It was like watching a bunch of well-dressed mannequins try to make an action film. What they did to Illya's character is sinful. He is now a psycho with a terrible anger disorder, but he still manages to be a mind-numbing bore. Henry Cavill is so bland - not suave, not clever and amusing. I don't know what this movie wanted to be. The comedic lines weren't that funny, the actors had very little good dialogue to work with, there was no suspense, no plot twists, no real evil bad guy to be frightened of. I didn't even feel the atmosphere of the Cold War as I watched. It could have been any time, any place. Generic is a good word for this movie. There was not much action, either. I'll pass on the next Man from Uncle if there is one."", ""There's a plot that glosses over the history very quickly,gives a brief mention of Hitler and the Russian and American conflict. However the events might arguably be set at any time, the threat of the flick being that nuclear weapons are being manufactured by dangerous hands. It's a theme that's been already handled many times on the big screen. In this story we see an excellent chemistry between the Actors but all in all The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is much more about fun than it is about substance. Aesthetically in general, the film marvels but then this wasn't really in doubt given its era and the glimpses seen in the trailer. There has been Ritchie's evident dedication to making his pictures look grand and to adding a classic sophistication to the world of espionage we haven't seen since early 007 days."", 'Towards the end of the movie, Henry Cavill\'s Napoleon Solo asks, ""How\'s THAT for entertainment?"" (when teaching the movie\'s villain a lesson about monologuing), and my answer regarding this movie would have to echo Waverly\'s ""very good"", as this film manages to out-Bond the last two actual Bond films. While it might be the unpopular opinion, I in fact enjoyed Guy Ritchie\'s two Sherlock Holmes films and so decided to give this a chance, knowing nothing about the original TV series this movie was based on and going in with no preconceived notions. One thing that sets it apart from other recent spy thrillers is it staying set in the 60s time period and not being ""modernised"". From the opening ""spy jazz"" music, it sets the tone for what will be a fun ride. Ritchie\'s unique directing style fits perfectly with this slick/stylish film and he proves once again to have the right touch when it comes to blending humor with serious moments (one example being in the most morbidly amusing torture sequence I\'ve seen since Bond\'s in Casino Royale). Whilst there are ""talky"" moments and occasions where the camera lingers on a shot for a solid moment, which those with impatience may grow restless during, there\'s also action (but not such that it\'s overkill) mixed with humour, some emotional beats and even the odd sexy moment. It all combines extremely well.Interestingly, as has been noted elsewhere, the main cast aren\'t using their own accents for their roles, with Brit Henry Cavill playing the American Napoleon Solo, American Armie Hammer playing Russian Illya Kuryakin and Swede Alicia Vikander as German Gaby Teller. Cavill, who I found dull/a bore in Man of Steel (then again, I felt that way about the film as a whole save for Antje Traue\'s Faora), is far better utilised as the suave/cool Solo here (which now brings the tally of cool movie characters by the name of \'Solo\' to TWO - the other being...hmm, let\'s think...). He oozes charm, confidence, elegance - all those words that make up the definition of \'suave\' - and has some great reactions. One scene I particularly liked was him just chilling, with a sandwich and bottle of vino in a truck he commandeered, as his newly assigned partner was attempting to escape some baddies in a boat. Just when you think Solo\'s almost heartless, he shows he\'s become quite attached to the Russian with anger management issues and does something nice for him (when they\'re not exchanging spy bugs or ramming each other through toilet stalls Casino Royale-style). As expected, they spend the majority of the film begrudgingly working alongside each other, bantering/arguing and showing each other up. Illya might be almost superhuman in strength and have the fancy fence-cutting tools, but Solo has the expertise breaking into vaults undetected...almost. Armie Hammer\'s better served here partnered with Cavill than he was with Depp in The Lone Ranger. The two play well off each other and have a nice fun dynamic. It also must be noted (since everyone\'s pointed it out regarding Tom Cruise in M:I 5) that while this film has a lot of stunts, both Cavill and Hammer took part in them, with the latter apparently giving his stunt double ""hardly a chance to do anything because he\'s out there doing it all by himself"". 2015 seems the year of the Awesome Swedes, as Alicia Vikander joins M:I 5\'s Rebecca Ferguson in making quite the memorable impression on screen. Apart from some rough-and-tumble with Illya, Vikander\'s Gaby sadly doesn\'t get to kick as much butt as the aforementioned Ferguson, but still proves hard to look away from when she\'s on screen (partly because she\'s dressed in eye-catching 60s fashion - which, along with the film\'s score/use of songs, goes a long way to creating the right \'mood\' for the film - but also because she\'s awesome in other ways). Her character, a mechanic at the start of the film, soon finds herself in the thick of the action during a great chase scene featuring her at the wheel, with Solo in the back seat and the then unknown to them Illya in hot pursuit (a fantastic sequence, with the directing, music, acting all flowing together seamlessly...and manual window winders used for great comedic effect). Vikander has interesting/fun dynamics with Cavill and Hammer, showing some different sides to her character (one instance being in an amusing dance sequence) whilst also proving smart/helpful and that there\'s a bit more to her than you might first expect. This trio of characters are a large part of what makes the film as good as it is. Elizabeth Debicki plays the icy cold Victoria to the best of her ability, although there\'s not that much going on with her that one wouldn\'t already suspect. Hugh Grant and Jared Harris are both good in their small parts. Playing Gaby\'s Uncle Rudi, Sylvester Groth is quite memorable in his role.While in his Sherlock Holmes movies Ritchie showed us in slow detail what Sherlock was going to do to his opponents (so we could actually *see* it/make sense of it before everything sped back up and he moved in a blur), it\'s sort of the opposite here, where we flashback to things we might\'ve missed, little details and such, that are later filled in for us and thus make sense. The use of split screen is also something he seems quite fond of, walking the line between being used effectively and overuse. It proves an extra flourish to an already very stylised film. I enjoyed this origin film of sorts for the team made up of our three main characters - who hopefully we\'ll get to see more of in a sequel, as this ended up being a pleasantly surprising addition to the spy film genre. For extra background info about the characters, as well as to learn what the acronym U.N.C.L.E. stands for, make sure to watch the stylish end credits.', ""I never watched the original TV show, but a friend of mine did, and he was really excited about this movie. Even I could tell they really put some effort in this. You get thrown back into an era you might (very likely) not know. But that shouldn't take away the fun you can have with this.It's a mystery why this underperformed at the box office, but might have to do with the fact, that people could not really tell what this is. The TV show is not as accessible as other (A-Team, Mission Impossible and so forth). If you get a chance and you like spy comedies, you should check this out. Even if it goes a bit overboard towards the end (a twist that doesn't make too much sense), it still pretty fun"", ""When I saw better than expected, I knew it would be good. But it was better than good, it was great.Very witty, sexy movie. Take the humour of Sherlock (with Robert Downey Jr. & Jude law) and stick it in a bond movie- then you have The man from U.N.C.L.E. - I like bond movies, but I LOVED the man from uncle. It doesn't get boring, or drop at any point. If you've read anything negative from critics Don't listen to what critics have to say, they don't like any kind of movie if it's not based on a true story. It's certainly worth the price of admission, you'll be glad you saw it. I'm honestly hoping a second will be made."", ""As a long-time fan of the original series who has watched rights disputes, and cast and director changes over the years, I viewed the pre-release publicity with high hopes and low expectations. But in the end, the film itself was a wonderful surprise! Witty, light-hearted without being a spoof and dramatic without being heavy-handed. The two main characters were updated from what was allowable in 60s television to satisfying and engaging modern versions of their original incarnations, and the attendant allies and villains were all one could want. The film was very much what the series could have been were it being done now, in the era of Game of Thrones and Mad Men. I've been twice and will be going again, as well as buying the DVD.

The characters are so well cast and well acted, their chemistry drives this movie. The cinematography is perfectly dark and haunting and the effects/CGI still hold up. Constantine is just a cool dark movie that fits a niche religious/demonic genre."", ""In my view an underrated and over-criticized movie - Constantine got nice visuals, an interesting story and some good acting. No masterpiece and not Mr. Reeves best movie but a solid piece of horror if you like to watch movies with demons and exorcism and some good ol' action. Thumbs up."", ""It's a Hollywood mystery why 2005's Constantine wasn't more popular and didn't at least get a sequel. There was a TV show a decade later but that only got a single series and considering some of the dross which get several series, I'm looking at you, Hemlock Grove, that's got to be a shame.So we have a bankable star, a strong supporting cast, a well written script, an existing lore and decent enough special effects ( for 2005 ). Oh yeah, there's also something about the eternal struggle between good and evil. So what's not to like? I guess it's a little too dark for some and the concept that humans are only the playthings of God and the other guy might be a tough bullet to chew for those who take religion seriously.Now streaming on Netflix."", ""Constantine (2005) in my opinion is an underrated Comic Book Film and one of my favorite anticipated supernatural horror flicks of my life. Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz reunite in this flick, after 9.years later when they both made together Chain Reaction (1996) one of my favorite sci-fi action flick. Anyway beside End of Days (1999) with Schwarzenegger in the starring role, Constantine is the only supernatural horror film that I know and like. After just watching this film I must say is a far way million times better than overrated The Exorcist (1973) that everyone highly praises that film. I love this movie to death and it is my fifth favorite best Keanu Reeves movie. John Constantine is iconic character that I think that Keanu Reeves did impressive acting performance, including way better job than he did in movies he is doing this days.I love this film. It has nice, thoroughly believable action for this sort of supernatural fare, and attractive leads in the shape of Keanu & Rachel, supported by Tilda Swinton as god's right-hand, Gabriel (reprising her Orlando persona). It looks great too and does the merging of separate worlds (Earth and Hell) very well. Keanu plays an embittered exorcist with a 30 a day habit and some caustic barbs for anyone he runs into. Rachel Weisz enters as a cop with some private history of her own connected with the occult world, and soon the two of them are drawn towards apocalypse & hell on earth. It's a throughly enjoyable purchase if you like the big theme Good Vs Evil, with the usual blurring, devils, angels, and shotguns firing holy shot. The CGI is also up to scratch, which isn't something you can always say on films being made even in 2008. Very, very enjoyable so long as you appreciate the subject matter and don't expect massive gun-battles, stop frame kung-fu, bullet time etc. An absolutely superb film. Keanu Reeves plays his role perfectly to his characters identity. Interesting throughout I was gripped to this film from start to finish. One of the best comic adaptations without a doubt.This is the type of comic book movie that I like to see";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A proper one, with Sean Connery."" – Steven Spielberg.In a prophetic article on ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", Jonathan Rosenbaum predicted the rise of ""set piece cinema"". He called the directors of these films ""disciples of Hitchcockian storyboards"" in which ""The Sequence becomes the raison d\'etre of film-making"". These sequences would themselves increasingly demand more time and money, as the only way to satiated audience would be to offer bigger and more outrageous set-pieces.The James Bond franchise was arguably the first big budget series to exploit ""set-piece cinema"". To minimise financial risks, each Bond script is virtually identical. The stunts differ, the exotic locales are alternated, but beyond these superficial changes the Bond plot is always the same. By the time George Lucas started working on ""Raiders"", there\'d already been 12 Bond flicks. The Bond formula had been set in stone and ""proven"" successful. All that was needed were a few minor cosmetic changes, and Lucas would have a franchise of his own.As such, all four Indiana Jones movies follow the Bond formula precisely. First we have the pre-story action sequence, a self-contained action sequence in which Indy searches for an artifact. In ""Raiders"" it\'s a Golden Idol, in ""Temple of Doom"" it\'s a flask of Ashes and in ""The Last Crusade"" it\'s the Cross of Coronado. In each film, Indy finds the artifact and then promptly loses it to the villains.After this pre-film action sequence, we then get the exposition. In the Bond films, this is where Bond learns of his mission. In Indiana Jones, this is where Indy learns of some religious myth. Bond and Indy then travel to an exotic location, Indy typically meets an attractive woman (who is always later captured), the audience is introduced to the sub-villain, and we\'re treated to two action sequences. At the end of the second act, Indy and Bond are then always captured by the central villain.Of course our heroes then escape, there\'s a final big action sequence (always, in Indy\'s case, involving a vehicle), and an ending in which the bad guys are killed by the very artifact they sought. There are repeated plot beats, like Indy making a deal with the enemy, run-ins with henchmen, repeated scenes dealing with Indy\'s phobias, but basically the film follows the standard Bond formula. As Spielberg remarked after first reading the ""Raiders"" script: ""It\'s Bond without the hardware"".As all Indiana Jones films are essentially the same, the only way to judge them are to pit their action sequences against one another. Each film has 5 action sequences. ""Raiders"" has one sequence involving a giant boulder, one involving an indoor gunfight, one involving a running battle with henchmen in Egypt, one involving a fistfight underneath a plane and one involving a moving truck. As what what constitutes action continuously gets ""faster"" and ""harder"", most of these sequences are deemed tame by modern audiences.""Temple"" also has five showcase sequences. One involving a song and dance routine, one involving a chase from henchmen, one involving an extended fist fight, one involving mine carts, and a final showdown on a rope bridge. Most of these sequences have aged well, the rope sequence the most tense moment in the trilogy, the others striking a tone that alternates between ultra sadistic and goofily over-the-top. More than other Indy films, ""Temple"" still feels audacious";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Sonic and Tails are a delight, Knuckles is epic and the action is great. Jim Carey's energy is amazing as Robotnik and the humour is pretty solid (although its missing the more witty humour the first had at times).However, the film is slightly ruined by the humans. Tom and Maddie are fine and are hardly in the film.But the entire film is utterly dragged down by a 15 minute sequence in the middle involving the bride raging at her wedding being crashed. When Sonic, Tails, Knuckles or Eggman don't appear for 15 minutes straight, something has gone wrong. The acting was horrendous in this scene and it was as if an awful cheesy romance film was shoved into a Sonic film.The third act regained some momentum but it started to drag on by the end. If the wedding scenes didn't happen, the pacing would be fine.Sonic becoming Super Sonic was epic, although its weird Robotnik's fate is unclear. The ending was very sweet as well.And that post-credit scene... wow!Overall, Sonic 2 is a fun time but when I rewatch it I'll be skipping the human scenes."", '""Sonic The Hedgehog 2"" is the sequel to the 2020 video game film adaptation of SEGA\'s ""Sonic The Hedgehog"". Starring James Marsden, Tika Sumpter, Jim Carrey, as well as the voice talents of Ben Schwartz, Colleen O\'Shaughnessey, and Idris Elba, it is a decent continuation that\'s sure to entertain both fans of the games and the previous film.Sometime after the events of first film, Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) has taken it upon himself to become a hero that others can rely on in Green Hills, Montana. After causing a great deal of collateral damage foiling a bank robbery, Sonic is forced to housesit for Tom (James Marsden) and Maddie (Tika Sumpter) while the two are attending a wedding in Hawaii. Meanwhile, Dr. Ivo ""Eggman"" Robotnik (Jim Carrey) has returned from the Mushroom Planet thanks to the help of Knuckles the Echidna (voiced by Idris Elba) to seek out the powerful Master Emerald, which will help them conquer the world. After learning of this, Sonic teams up with his new fox friend Miles ""Tails"" Prower (voiced by Colleen O\'Shaughnessey) to stop both Dr. Eggman and Knuckles before they can wreak havoc with the Emerald.What I believe made the first ""Sonic The Hedgehog"" movie such a success was how it managed to appeal to hardcore Sonic fans while also functioning as an amusing family film in its own right. Something like this is easier said than done because various other movies based on video games have tried too hard to be as close to the original games as possible, alienating uninitiated viewers in the process. Because of how it was able to rise above this common mistake, I rank the first Sonic movie among the best video game related films of all time (although considering the lack of competition, the bar isn\'t exactly very high). Most of what made its predecessor work so well has been replicated here in the sequel, as it provides about the same amount of entertainment value one might expect from a follow-up.Deviating from the original, this film has a slightly darker tone since the Emerald is shown to be something that could easily destroy all of life as we know it. Because of this, we see Sonic actually treating this as a serious threat, limiting the amount of jokes and wisecracks he makes when attempting to hunt it down. This could be compared to the power of Infinity Stones in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where their use has the potential to cause catastrophic damage if it were to fall into the wrong hands. I\'m not entirely sure if this is accurate to the games since I\'m only a casual fan of the series but it all seems like a typical plot device one would see when playing something related to Sonic the Hedgehog.However, things aren\'t all doom and gloom since that signature fun factor is still there to prevent things from becoming too bleak. Sonic, who is now joined by his good friend Tails, can be seen dancing off against foes to some catchy songs on his iPhone and snowboarding down mountainous slopes in Siberia. Scenes like these are as fast-paced and likeable as the blue hedgehog himself, elevating the film above the usual onslaught of family movie fodder designed solely towards very small children. To my surprise, Sonic now only seems to use his superspeed sparingly rather than just for the sake of it. Perhaps this was done in an effort to develop Sonic more as a character using his head instead of mindlessly speeding around, or maybe they simply didn\'t want to show Sonic being way too overpowered. Either way, it is an interesting creative decision.Visually, the film looks considerably better than its predecessor. Years ago, many people on the internet infamously cyber-bullied the makers of the first film into changing Sonic\'s look, winning out in the end with his current design. Normally I\'m against this type of vitriolic attack on filmmakers but after seeing the fixed product, I\'d say it was all for the best. I\'m not sure how they were able to pull it off, but Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles all look well integrated into our world. Scenes where human characters were interacting with Sonic, both physically and verbally, all looked quite convincing, as though there really were an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog sitting next to them or dancing alongside them in a bar.I also like how each of the three characters\' distinct colours did a clever job of representing their personality traits. Sonic\'s blue stands out as he confidently speeds past everybody, Tails\'s orange highlights his supportive nature, and Knuckles\' red perfectly mirrors his angry determination. Whether or not this was done intentionally I\'m not entirely sure but if it was, then it was a nice addition the film. With that in mind, it also makes it easier to distinguish each of them from a distance, especially during certain action scenes where many things were happening at once.Like last time, Ben Schwartz does a great job playing up Sonic\'s cocky attitude to full effect. Although he still has that streak of impulsivity, Sonic this time feels as though he is trying to make an effort to use his intellect rather than just his speed to hunt down the Master Emerald. It was also nice to hear Colleen O\'Shaughnessey reprise her role as Tails from the video games, as I can\'t really think of any other mainstream actors capable of voicing the loveable two-tailed fox. If you enjoyed O\'Shaughnessey\'s voice of Tails in the games, then you are sure to like how she is able to hold her own alongside the rest of the cast. Idris Elba is appropriately irritable and brutally strong as the voice of Knuckles. Elba seems to be voicing Knuckles in the vein of the MCU\'s Thor in his first appearance, in that he is very powerful and one track minded but ignorant to basic things like food and recreational activities.Jim Carrey\'s performance as Dr. Eggman was easily my favourite thing about the original film. I remember laughing out loud quite a lot at the over-the-top material the writers gave him to work with. It was almost as though the character has been personally tailored to make use of all his comedic talents. This time, he bears a stronger resemblance to his video game counterpart, complete with a bald head and comically huge moustache, and like before he steals the show in virtually every scene he is in. For a man in his 60s, Carrey still demonstrates a considerable amount of versatility and physical dexterity when playing this iconic villain. I look forward to seeing more of Carrey\'s version of Dr. Eggman in future Sonic films.As far as video game movies and sequels are concerned, ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2"" is a fun follow-up that is able to recapture what made the original a success in the first place. It isn\'t afraid to be goofy fun if it wants to be but it also doesn\'t shy away from serious moments whenever it feels necessary. If you liked the first film, then it stands to reason that you should like this one as well. Judging by the mid-credits scene, it seems there are some more surprises on the horizon so Sonic fans definitely ought to stay tuned.I rate it 7/10.', ""The first Sonic movie was surprisingly competent. This one is even better, incorporating additional elements from the games and sticking to more of an action-adventure plot. It's a kid's movie through and through (way more toilet humor this go-around), but a fun one that never takes itself too seriously. Everyone in my theater was having a great time with it.As with the original, Jim Carrey steals the show as Eggman. This man is 60 years old and yet he has more verve than I do! He's so energetic he sometimes resembles a cartoon more than Sonic, Knuckles, or Tails! While I respect his desire to retire, I do hope he holds on and does the third movie-- there would be such a void without him there."", ""I can only imagine how much Jim Carreys been paid to do this. So many bad lines and poor jokes.The graphics are fun, the plot is actually bearable and engaging, but the end result is something only a 10 year old will enjoy (which isn't necessarily the target demographic, given the original Sonic game came out almost 40 years ago).Sonic and Robotnik's lines are tired and unfunny, the whole marriage subplot is disappointing and unnecessary conflict.The only good thing about this is the women fighting and the ending."", 'Following Dr Robotnik\'s exile, Sonic has settled down in rural Montana with adoptive parents Sheriff Tom and wife Maddie. What follows includes Robotnik\'s escape, the arrival of additional alien oddities Miles ""Tails"" Prower, the twin-tailed fox and Knuckles, the aggressive echidna, a marriage in Hawaii, a dance-off in Siberia, mushroom machinery, a Master Emerald, some annoying military intervention, and a giant robot.That sounds like a lot, but it\'s pretty straightforward stuff in a plot which aims directly at a 3-part audience - kids, tolerant parents, and mature gamers with fond memories of the original games. And I think it succeeds. It\'s brash, colourful, fast, eventful, funny, likeable, and has some pretty good visuals.It\'s not Shakespeare, it\'s dumb, but it\'s great fun.', ""This movie definitely felt like a step up from the previous which was good but kind of just felt like a road trip movie that just happened to have Sonic and Robotinik dropped in the middle of it, this one felt more aligned with the items and locations of the games and had a lot more fanservice in it, with more action and comedyI have had a soft spot for the Sonic games, the original 2D games revolutionised 2D platformers at the time, however the 3D games always felt behind innovation though some are better than others. Sonic 06 and Rise of Lyric are definitely the worst ones, though can still be entertaining if you love hilarious glitches and super cheesy writing and scenesThis movie however is still quite good despite having a few flays, Jim Carrey's acting as Robotnik has been taken a step up on the cheese factor and now feels like a full fledged cartoon character with the dial all the way up to 10, than just Jim Carrey pretending to be Robotnik. He even feels more cartoonified than what Eggman was in most of the recent games, but Jim knows how to get into that zone and stay there because he lives and breathes that styleI really liked the addition of Tails in the movie and felt very faithful to the character, Knuckles was good too but kind of felt like he was dumbed down a little compared to the wisecracking character of the games to an extent. I also wasn't a real big fan of his African accent, but it makes sense why they made him that way. I didn't like how Tails was unconscious for almost 20 minutes with no dialogue and it felt lazy to me, like they were compensating for not having enough lines for him in a very cheap way.I did like how the Chaos Emeralds were more focussed upon in this movie aswell as the Master Emerald, and it was fun to see Sonic turn into Super Sonic at the end, though I thought they could have played a bit more with it in that scene and felt it was a bit too short and glossed over too quicklyOverall, I had a fun time with this movie and I think fans will like it a lot too, it felt more like a Sonic adventure in this one and I liked that, maybe we'll see Shadow and Amy make an appearance in the 3rd one."", ""This movie is definitely for the young. It's not hard to see what's coming, and the usual cliche riddled dialogue is in evidence. I couldn't see anyone over 12 getting any enjoyment out of this one. I like Jim Carrey well enough but the content just isn't there for him."", ""I didn't see the first movie, so I'm not sure how this compares, but I found this movie pretty upbeat and entertaining. It took me a moment to get used to how the movie set up Sonic in the real world, and from then on the plot carried things well enough.Knuckles as a character was my favorite part of this movie, with Tails being a close second. I enjoyed the action and how simple the plotline was, too, but some of the jokes and memes fell a bit flat for me. (Looking at you, Eggman.) The dance battle also felt a bit silly, but that's to be expected. Overall, I had a good time watching, and would recommend this movie if you like Sonic and have some time to kill."", 'There were too many children in the cinema, I felt strange. But I had fun. There were some scenes that were a bit boring, but overall it was a fun movie. Some movie references were also nice.P. S : Jim Carrey was awesome !', ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the sequel to 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog, a film that had a rocky development, but would listen to fans and fix its incarnation to Sonic, resulting in it being well received, and breaking the Detective Pikachu movie's record as the highest-grossing video game-based movie, and the highest-grossing superhero movie of 2020.Here, while Tom and Maddie are going to Hawaii to attend Rachel's wedding to a man named Randall, leaving Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) in charge of the house. However, Dr. Robotnik (played once again by Jim Carey) has managed to escape the Mushroom Planet with the aid of Knuckles (voiced by Idris Elba), whom he repays by taking him to Sonic so he can destroy him. However, just as Sonic is about to be creamed, a police car rams Knuckles, revealing Tails (voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessy, the only VA to reprise his or her role from the video games). After finding out Longclaw left a message telling Earth is the hiding place of the Master Emerald, the one thing Knuckles seeks to restore honor to his extinct tribe (as he is the last one left).Now this is another good example of how sequels should be done. Sonic 2 is an epic film, as Sonic teams up with Tails and faces Dr. Robotnik and Knuckles. The cast from the first film returns with some new faces appearing, and the new story is awesome. Jim Carey still hams it up as the evil doctor and even Rachel gets a scene where she can be a heroine. But the best thing about this film is that it brings Knuckles back to being a serious rival to Sonic, compared to the Sega games demoting him to the role of being an idiot since the Sonic Boom cartoon. It makes me wish Sega would make notes if they saw the films, because IMHO, Paramount is basically doing Sonic better than Sega did post-Sonic Adventure 2 (it even goes as far as to give Knuckles a father, something the games would never do).However, if there are some complaints I have, it's that this movie has some scenes that are basically imitating scenes from the first film (the Siberian lounge scene reminds me of the Piston Pit scene from the first movie, only instead of a bar fight, we get a dance off), but this is a good sequel regardless. Don't pay heed to the critics bashing it and watch it if you can and see if it clicks with you."", ""I saw Sonic the Hedgehog 2, starring James Marsden-Westworld_tv, Death at a Funeral";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The first Equalizer was a surprisingly brutal and visceral action film that gave Liam Neeson movies a run for its money. While the sequel is full of just as many, if not more, incredible kill sequences by Denzel's character, I think there's a lack of connection I felt this time around. I wasn't nearly as connected to the story, and perhaps that's because the revenge didn't feel as sweet this time around. The ending of the film is a great sequence on its own and there are certain scenes I will certainly revisit, but I'm not sure the film as a whole works quite as well.6.6/10"", ""Nothing special here, very predictable plot, which is just an excuse to let the equalizer kick some bad guys ass.\nAnyways, it's so enjoyable to see good old Denzel being that superhero, you just feel bad for all those bad guys who dare to fight him..\nThis movie is a bit slow, with some scenes that stretch too much, could have been done better but I'm a big fan of Denzel, who is an amazing actor and I enjoy seeing any movie he plays in especially action movies.\nLooking forward to another sequel, this can be a long franchise hopefully with better plots and story."", 'One good actor can not produce a movie, when nothing else is there to add.

A huge potential wasted in a mediocre script, with barely convincing characters and a totally flat course. No music, nor the hurricane, could add to the lack of vibration in this scenario.

You have an elderly, a young student sort of thing, a mentor thing and what the Equalizer is good at of course.Now some may feel that it all is a bit convoluted. Others may cherish that it tries so many things and steers things away from what the first one achieved (being straight forward and all).

With the charisma of Denzel you can never really go wrong character wise either of course. Strong sequel overall"", ""This is a film that spends most of its time in a haze. A bunch of unrelated set pieces loosely being woven together by such a small string. There aren't really any stakes for Denzel's character.

But, while Robert was dealing with that he still had time to do some clean up in his hometown of Boston--and I mean clean up in every sense of the words.I liked the different characters in this movie and I particularly liked Robert's interaction with Miles (Ashton Sanders), the young African American male headed down the wrong path. The high-energy, pulse-racing fights weren't aplenty like the first installment but in their place was a little more substance.

Like the TV show, there's a new victim every week and Chloë Grace Moretz does not return for this one. I would have liked more time with Susan who is the victim of the week. The opening train sequence is unnecessary. It would have been better to have Robert fighting the rich sleazes in the high-rise or the staged suicide-murder. That suicide-murder is really frightening and would set off the tension very well instead of the disconnected Robert train incident. With more time with Dave and Susan, the personal stakes become much higher and the intensity is raised. I do like Robert's mentoring of Miles and I wouldn't mind if Miles returns for another sequel.

The result is an illogically conceived and satirical prequel that will amuse and delight and ultimately devastate with its bleak Shakesperean tragedy.When Taylor\'s spacecraft unexpectedly splashes down in 1973 and is retrieved by a military envoy, the three astronauts that emerge from the capsule are not revealed to be Taylor, Landon and Dodge, but rather the astonishing simian ape-chimps Cornelius, Zira and Milo... the third of which is a completely disposable character who is appropriately killed off very early by a caged zoo gorilla who was probably jealous that the talking simian chimpanzees were getting all of the attention. With Milo out of the picture, the story focuses on the relationship between Cornelius and Zira in ways that were not afforded the opportunity in the two previous films and is filled with tongue-in-cheek episodes inspired by Pierre Boulle\'s original novel as Cornelius and Zira go around ""aping"" 20th century human culture (a subtle and clever mockery of our own) in an attempt to make themselves fit in to our society.While Cornelius and Zira make themselves at home as cultural ""celebrities"" they are being carefully monitored under the watchful auspices of the nefarious Dr. Otto Hasslein played by recognizable character actor Eric Braeden (of Young and the Restless fame) who listens with great interest to what the talking chimps have to say about where they came from during a Presidential Inquiry and how they managed to arrive in Taylor\'s spacecraft as Cornelius explains that the capsule was found when it washed ashore and was repaired by Milo -- an implausibility which is the film\'s glaring continuity error since Taylor\'s spacecraft sunk into the depths of the Forbidden Zone it is a far fetched conclusion that they somehow managed to not only find, retrieve and repair it (even if they had repaired Astronaut Brent\'s crashed spacecraft from Beneath which was overlooked as well) with engineering far in advance of their own intellectual ape intelligence (which Milo only ""half-understood"" as Cornelius describes it) but managed to do so and escape within a very small window of time before the planet was obliterated by the shock-wave of destruction catapulting them backwards in time and arriving at roughly the same destination and era as Taylor\'s original point of departure (it could be argued that these narrative inconsistencies support evidence of ""Hasslein\'s Observed Time Curve"" which suggest that a predestination paradox created alternate intersecting timelines as illustrated by the incongruent timeline of events between Conquest and Battle). Nevertheless, once you get past the major plot hole and just go with it, Escape is a fun and dramatically intense film but is my least favorite second only to the weakest link in the evolutionary Apes chain";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Rice, Dennis Banks, Pete Postlethwaite, Colm Meaney, Mac Andrews, Malcolm Storry;Three trappers protect the daughters of a British Colonel in the midst of the French and Indian War.;"['My all time favorite film. Still gives me chills. It\'s easily one of the most amazing films I\'ve ever seen and it also features perhaps one of the greatest soundtracks ever. They way, the music hits the scenes is just absolutely astonishing.In essence, The Last of the Mohicans is an epic adventure/romance set against the panorama of a frontier wilderness ravaged by the French and Indian War.Director Michael Mann brilliantly captures the essence of the era ( 1750\'s)-the hand-to hand battles, the scalping\'s, the harsh life in the wilderness, etc. But, I especially love the way that the film depicts the perspectives of each of the groups and the people involved. Whether they are competing for military superiority, referring to the French General Montcalm ( Patrice Chéreau ) and the British Colonel Munro (Maurice Roëves) or the simple existence of peoples in their homeland, the viewer is given a true sense of their mindset in the midst of a great conflict.Even the story\'s main antagonist, Magua (wonderfully portrayed by Wes Studi) draws us in.The always amazing Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Hawkeye, rugged frontiersman and adopted son of the Mohicans. Day-Lewis, with flowing mane and heaving pecs, makes a virile but sensitive hero for the screen and Madeline Stowe is Cora Munro, aristocratic daughter of the proud British Colonel Munro. Stowe manages to find in Cora a fiery balance between sensitivity and strength. One can\'t help but feel fascinated and/ or captivated by her dark eyes and flowing dark hair.Generally, the film tells the story of Hawkeye and Cora Munro, two people who meet across cultural and class barriers, and are presented serious new challenges.But the film has so more. For example, the contrasts between the two brothers ( Hawkeye and Uncas) and the two sisters ( Cora and Alice). Hawkeye being the more daring and outspoken from the start. He dares to approach the dark haired Cora when he was drawn to her, where as Uncas (Eric Schweig) never openly reveals his attraction to Alice ( Jodhi May). Besides, those short simple looks and glances.But then again, do we really need lines? No. Both Schweig and May have very few lines, but it is their eyes, that are saying everything... Case in point, that sequence in the cave, where Uncas pulls Alice back from the falls and holds her.All in all, I have to honestly say that the last 40 or 50 minutes or so of this movie, are just completely off the hook. I\'d wager it might start along the lines of hearing that huge Huron war party cry as the British Army retreats from Ft. William Henry. This leads to Hawkeye vow to rescue Cora no matter what in the scene that takes place behind the waterfall. This is a scene that has been copied and mimicked by many others ( notably Tom Cruise in M1-2) but the way Day-Lewis delivers the line ""You stay alive, no matter what occurs! I will find you. No matter how long it takes, no matter how far, I will find you"" simply makes you believe him.Another amazing sequence would be when our heroes are running up the hill to save Cora, Alice, and the British Maj. Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) after they\'ve been captured. For whatever, reason the Directors Expanded DVD emits the haunting Clannad song, ""I Will Find You"". Why this isn\'t heard during the scene is beyond me.I\'ve watched this film way too many times now, but easily it is the last 15 minutes that are the most powerful and emotionally devastating. For instance, just watch the way the sequence of music starts with Duncan shouting ""take her and get out"", you know that something serious is going to happen and Duncan is doomed......Or the scene of Uncas\'s and then Alice\'s shocking deaths. I\'ve always viewed the later scene as the first time Alice takes control of her own destiny and chooses not to be a victim. She finally snaps out of her shock-induced haze and takes action. Her choice of suicide is made from a place of strength.But it is also the more quiet of moments that simply resonate. For instance, when Chingachgook ( Russell Means) speaks about being the Last of his tribe.A film that truly resonates. No matter the age or the mood.', ""This movie won the Oscar for best sound. I have little respect for the Oscars. Best score ever, some of the best photography ever. Day-Lewis gives a powerful performance whose only fault is that he has done better. Copper's sprawling story comes to life with powerful action scenes and emotional close-ups. The final chase is stunning to watch. 10/10"", ""What a beautiful and sad film, the heroes decimating peoples, aborigines and Indians, in favor of a fight between whites for land that they don't even belong to, very sad... Very well produced, a novel to lighten the massacres, a great one close, the real heroes being heroes..."", 'Daniel Day-Lewis and the supporting cast do a fine job in this visually stunning romantic adventure. The production design, action scenes and sound effects were all first-class. Sadly the story was too weak and the slow pace of the film in some places felt not motivated. I liked the powerful score, but it was used too much and became repetitive. Still a decent film by Michael Mann with many memorable scenes.', 'The year is 1757... The principal occupants of the region are Native Americans and a great diversity of wild life... It is the third year of the war between French and British, for the possession of the continent, somewhere on the frontier west of the Hudson River...

A flood of energy leaves Iman and enters Connor. He is taken in by the police who knows him as antique shop owner Russell Edwin Nash. They don't have the evidence and he is released. Forensics expert Brenda J. Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) investigates the case. She is drawn into a romance with him and the secret world of immortals battling to be the last survivor. In flashbacks, Connor's origin is revealed. It's 1536 Scotland. Connor is mortally wounded by the Kurgan (Clancy Brown) in a battle against the clan Fraser. He miraculously survives and is banished for being in league with the devil. He finds his love Heather. They are joined by Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez (Sean Connery) who teaches him sword fighting. Eventually, the Kurgan catches up to them.This was critically panned in its day. The music video editing and big camera moves probably threw off the critics. It might be too much to take in on the big screen. I saw it on home video and it rocked. The music video editing works for me. The rocking Queen music is awesome. It's a great idea and I love the execution. For a while, Lambert seems to be an interesting actor but he never expanded his acting range. This is one of my favorites of his movies."", 'Highlander is perhaps the definitive modern-day, non-horror fantasy adventure.  The use of flashbacks within the story is perhaps not unique, but the concept sees its full fruition here.  Such integral ""flashback storytelling"" would later be borrowed by many movies and TV shows (the Highlander series itself, Forever Knight, and Outlaws among the latter).  Everyone is well cast, from the major roles (Lambert, Brown, Connery, Hart, and North) to the minor roles (Peter Diamond, Hugh Quarshie, Sheila Gish, and Christopher Malcolm, among others).  Of necessity, must be seen in the Director\'s Cut version.  Various web sites also have the further ""missing scenes,"" including the Kurgan\'s battle with Immortal Yung Dol Kim, and Kastagir and MacLeod actually having that party they mention.', 'I saw this movie for the very first time in the late eighties and, for as far as I still can remember of course, I know that I was very impressed by the special effects used in this movie. Of course, when it comes to special effects, much has changed since this movie was created 20 years ago, but it was still nice to watch.Connor Macleod is the Highlander, an immortal who was born in 1518 and who fought his first battle on the Scottish Highlands in 1536. When he gets mortally wounded, but doesn\'t die, he is banned by his clan because they fear the Devil\'s work has made him survive. Five years later he meets Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez, who explains him why he didn\'t die and what it means to be an immortal. He finds out that he can only die when decapitated by another immortal and that, in the future, he will have to compete in some kind of contest. Only the best will survive and win ""The Prize"". The contest takes place in 1985, in New York City and he\'ll have to face Victor Kruger / The Kurgan, a murderously brutal barbarian.Despite the fact that it sometimes may look a bit dated because of the special effects, this movie is still enjoyable. The story is interesting and the acting was good (personally I loved Clancy Brown the most as The Kurgan). And of course the soundtrack is very good as well, at least when you can appreciate the music by Queen. If not, than this may well be the soundtrack from hell for you, because the only music in it is from Queen. Overall I can say that, despite some minor defects, I had a good time watching this movie. That\'s why I give it a 7/10.', ""Highlander isn't a perfect movie by all means, at least in my opinion, the film is a little too long, Christopher Lambert tries hard but comes across as rather bland and the effects towards the end are a little cheesy. However, cinematography, costumes, sets and scenery-wise Highlander is great, and most of the effects are decent. The soundtrack is killer, the storyline is acceptably paced and basically a fun standard sword-and-sorcery sort of tale, the script may have some toshy moments but boy did it entertain me, the action is well choreographed and the direction is very good. Also Sean Connery is as charismatic and memorable as ever, and Clancy Brown's character is written even better and he too is great. Overall, a fun and entertaining film, shame its sequel was such an abomination but that's another story. 7/10 Bethany Cox"", 'I think if this came out in the earlier half of the decade it would have been more successful financially. However, in Europe the film was a hit and it cemented it\'s cult status. Highlander has an original concept that immortals have been fighting each other for an eternity for ""the prize"", when only a few remain. The film looks great and was slickly shot with the triumphant music of Queen in the background. There is a good amount of action and Christopher Lambert has a good presence as the lead. He also had excellent chemistry with Sean Connery (who gave one of his most memorable performances). The best performance comes from Clancy Brown who is terrifying as barbarian immortal ""The Kurgan"". There is a whole lot of good swordfighting action to be had here, as well as quotable dialogue and occasional humor. Highlander was really well written and original fantasy action film. The sequels don\'t measure up to this at all. But this is a really unique and very good film that holds up well.', 'Full of 80s cliché but... One of the best movie soundtrack ever!', 'Ah, Highlander! An epic tale of immortals locked in a vast struggle, slowly decapitating each other over the centuries until there is only one, who shall win the mysterious Prize. Things don\'t get much cooler! My first experience of Highlander was through the Queen soundtrack, which is, to say the least, amazing. I had a brief encounter with the TV series during my youth, but I was far too young to understand it while it was still on the air. Still, the concept and the soundtrack (which pretty much tells the story by itself) left me with high expectations.To be honest though, I felt very disappointed. It\'s painful to think that someone could take all this good stuff, throw in some brilliant actors, have some (for the day) stunning special effects, and churn out something so average.Christopher Lambert does his best as Connor MacLeod, The Highlander, who we are lead to believe is suffering constant anguish from his immortal life, seeing everyone he cares about die one by one while he lives on. Sadly the script doesn\'t explore this in a particularly creative way. As we all know, all 80\'s movies - even really good ones - must have a pointless and poorly explained love interest, and in this movie she comes in the form of Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart). The idea is that she resurfaces the pain of Connor\'s wife\'s death centuries ago, but more time is dedicated to cliché ""romance"" scenes than to Connor\'s development as a character, and Brenda just comes over as annoyingly superfluous.By far the best character in the movie is Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez, played by Sean Connery, who as well as bringing a lot of good humour to the movie, also gives a good sense of what being an immortal is all about";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However in spite of great action scenes and excessive violence the plot is poorly thought out relies on many unrealistic factors.So firstly the good: the action is mostly well thought out with wounds affecting the fighting styles as the movie progresses, characters get tired and worn out showed by a slowing of pacing. Unlike recent action movies characters in a fight don\'t necessarily come at the main character one at a time. Whilst there are occasions where ""bad guys"" come at the ""good guys"" one at a time because they\'re preoccupied. Alternatively when the opposition are available to fight they do. In some scenes you can see multiple people fighting in a 2v1, group pile-on, 3v2\'s etcetera.Next character arcs for some characters make sense. Tyler, the protagonist\'s, arc throughout the movie is one of self hate due to the inability to be there for his own child. But by the end he forgives himself. The main antagonist is self-destructive for the sake of revenge on the protagonist, forsaking everything in order to destroy the protagonist and his accomplices.However despite the good, many aspects of this movie hang on the head of one character who extends this movie from being 55 minutes long into a 1 hour 50 movie. This character of course is the inexplicably stupid teenage boy named Sandro. Now don\'t get me wrong, Andro Japaridze does a great job of acting and none of the fault falls on his head. In fact for the script and dialogue given to his character, Andro Japaridze out performed the role. However due to the producers need to extend the movie and lazy writing, his character, Sandro, is turned into a plot device.Firstly do the writers actually expect a elite spec-ops mercenary crew member to be reckless enough to leave a tactical cell phone on a table in eyesight of an angsty teen, but they also believe that the same teen who so far has demonstrated no functional capability to be able to sneak off with the phone and then send a message to the same ""bad guys"" that\'ve abused his mother his entire life. But let that go and the movie continues to use this well-acted character as a poor plot device.Next we get to a scene where Sandro is seemingly apologetic and reveals that he\'s been messaging the antagonist. But do any of the mercenary crew search him for the tactical cell he\'s been using? No. Let\'s just recall that one of the ""highly trained spec-ops"" crew is missing their tactical cell, and not one of the crew even thinks to confiscate it from the kid later? Then Sandro who\'s just admitted that he made a mistake decides to take off and surrender himself to the antagonist, leading to the final standoff.During the final standoff Sandro, our all important plot device, decides to agreeably wear a suicide vest just to help out the antagonist.So in conclusion the movie is good, but one character ruins it. Because of the lines and plot put into this one character. I have no dislike towards the actor who did a brilliant job, but the character was not well written enough, and it\'s a shame that they were forced into being a plot device used to extend the movie by an hour.', ""We need more movies like this, this is what movies are supposed to be!

This time, it's personal.This is perfectly fine as Chris Hemsworth tries to build a new B-action franchise over on Netflix. The Russo brothers have given Sam Hargrave an opportunity to direct. Sam is a stunt guy and this is most notable for its long action stunt sequences. I would prefer that he leaves the CGI out of his work as much as possible. The prison break section worn me out as the CGI action gets really unreal. It felt fake and I stopped caring. The tower apartment is another story. Sure, there is also CGI and outrageous action, but the apartment tower grounds the action. It felt much more real and therefore much more compelling. This franchise needs to figure out what makes it special. The long action sequences should be that specialty as long as they ground it with real action."", ""As usual, the fights are over the top (body armor may stop bullets, but the kinetic energy is still hammering into the body in real life).

As seems to be the norm for this sort of movie, we got to see a variety of exotic firearms, from AKs with no stock to M240s and M249s to RPGs, PDWs, mini-guns, sniper weapons, etc. Also as usual, the weapons have extraordinary effect (not sure how you could get 40mm grenades to explode that close to the weapon that fired them) although hand-grenade explosions do seem to be close to accurate (the RPGs fly more like AT-4s though - RPGs don't really fire that accurately). Lots of bangs, lots of bashing, lots of knives (and axes and shovels and pitchforks), lots of shooting... but the plot actually has a start and a finish (and an opportunity for another one)."", 'I really enjoyed the first half of this movie and thought it was better than the first. Good action, great filming, interesting lighting choices, and the acting was better too. And while we need to suspend some disbelief at how remarkably lethal Tyler is, I never felt completely taken out of the first movie or the first half of this one. That all changed with the Vienna sequence, which was incredibly unrealistic and dumb in the way it was portrayed. An unknown helicopter crossing into Austria from Slovakia and then using a minigun on the most recognizable skyscraper in the city would bring much more of a response and much more quickly too, particularly if this movie is set in time present of the real world.', ""Don't trust any review you read that says it's as good or better than the first. There's no comedy, the fights don't feel nearly as intense, the long camera shots don't hold the same weight and it just feels bland. I honestly fell asleep many times through it and had to rewatch it over and over to finally get through it. Whereas the first was one of the best action movies that year.

The camerawork and editing are excellent and the stunt work, action set pieces and effects are second to none. The villain is as nasty as they come and Hemsworth is fabulously tough in the lead. Great, visceral fun - presumably more will follow.', ""Loved the first one. It was excellent and set the bar so high, that a sequel could only disappoint.There's a couple of great action setpieces in 'Extraction II' but that's pretty much it. It misses the same tension as found in the first one between the lead characters. All the bad guys - the standard eastern european thug - are cardboard characters, and it doesn't really offer anything new, except setting us up for yet another installment.Unlike this sequel, Rake was really put through the ringer in the first one, and we've felt his struggle and it had many interesting characters, like Raja - foe turned friend - who I hope returns in the future."", ""A deeper story, more emotions, and even more spectacular action make this sequel way better than the original, contrary to Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian who gave 1 star out of 5 to this spectacular and rather entertaining project. He accused Chris Hemsworth of wanting more money for his troubles from Netflix, which may be true, but missed the point entirely by devaluing a modern action movie as money hungry crap. By all means, it is not. The story is much better because it humanizes its characters in a good sense, showing just enough - and not more - emotions to give it more layers than bang-bang. Golshifteh Farahani and Adam Bessa are both bullseye casting as so is Tornike Gogrichiani as the villain. The acting, camerawork, editing and most notably the score all shows unquestionable high production values of a Hollywood blockbuster. It is a modern action flick that leaves behind the past couple of decades' attempts, elevating it to the heights of the best James Bond and Mission Impossible efforts."", ""Compared to the first film, the story in this one isn't as good, but the action and choreography is top shelf. I'll even say it, it's better than John Wick 4, the difference being that this film has much more realism and is much less monotonous, and Hemsworth looks much better doing it than Keanu Reeves, who looks uncoordinated compared to Hemsworth in this one. Major props once again to director Sam Hargrave for the directing and action choreography that was flawless. Every action sequence looks absolutely authentic and he even threw in some never seen before action tactics. I had always felt that Hemsworth was born to play Thor, but now, he is the new and improved Jason Bourne and John Wick combined. Can't wait for part 3!"", 'Its a good action movie with a nonsense, dont get me wrong some of the fight scenes are good but some are just stupid. So he saves the friend (nick) from falling down and throws her to safety and tell her go help the woman, but she dosent have the time even a sec to shoot the bad guy .. i mean they were both hanging around in the air like setting ducks !!!! Seriously. I mean cmon chris shoots two helicopters down while the train is moving and the heavy machine gun just happen to be next to him!! GIVE ME A BREAK RESPECT THE BRAIN MAN. I know some ppl may like this kinda movie but in my opinion the first one was more believable.', ""So, we're in 2023, there are very damn sophisticated guns, transports, way of healing and, the second half of the movie could have been avoided if that phone had a screen lock. 😱😱😱If the plot was obvious and the betrayal expected, it really lacked of originality on this one. My brain was off and enjoying the very good prison extraction but I can't believe this security nonsense. Obviously nobody reports the missing phone or illegal conversations...Main characters are just where they need to be without surprise.The rest is a rather entertaining classical action movie with an open ending for a third movie.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Everyone I know has seen at least one of the Indiana Jones movies and usually Raiders of the Lost Ark is their favorite. Now I loved Raiders of the Lost Ark, I also really loved Temple of Doom even though it gets a lot of hate for it\'s darkness. But The Last Crusade is my favorite of the trilogy and the strongest in my opinion. For goodness\'s sake we have Sean Connery as Indiana\'s father, how could we get any better than that? I love his way of saying ""Junior!"", always gets me in a good chuckle. Harrison Ford still has that same Indy charm that swoons the ladies, the adventure that captivates the guys and takes us on an incredible journey that we\'ll never forget.In 1938, Indiana finally recovers the Cross and donates it to his friend Marcus Brody\'s museum. Indiana is later taken to the residence of wealthy businessman Walter Donovan, who informs him that his father has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail, leaving behind partial directions from an incomplete stone tablet along with his diary containing his life\'s work on the Grail. Indiana and Marcus travel to Venice to investigate Henry\'s disappearance, meeting up with his colleague Elsa Schneider. Discovering catacombs beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indiana and Elsa find the tomb of Sir Richard, a knight of the First Crusade who is buried with a complete version of the tablet. Indiana finds his father, only to be betrayed by Elsa, who reveals that she and Donovan are working with the Nazis to find the Grail. The Nazis steal the Grail diary and capture Marcus in Iskenderun, where he was sent with pages from the diary to seek the protection of Sallah. The Joneses manage to escape the castle and follow the Nazis to Berlin, where they recover the diary from Elsa. The Joneses, Marcus and Sallah arrive to find that the Nazis are unable to pass through three ""trials"" of God. After Indy\'s father gets shot, he doesn\'t have much of a choice as to pass the trials and choose the correct cup to save his father\'s life.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is one of my favorite movies of all time, it\'s just a flawless movie that will always be timeless. My future kids will watch these movies, they\'re just a lot of fun. Who said archeology can\'t be fun? This also has one of the most exciting chase scenes of all time, Indiana is trying to rescue his father and a friend from a Nazi tank and he is on a horse, a brutal fight ensues and was just so exciting to watch. I\'ve watched this movie since I was a little girl and I still watch it with pleasure today, even with my friends we love watching Indiana and his adventures.

No modern adventure film comes close to this."", ""This is definitely better than the other two movies in the trilogy in my opinion. The plot was intriguing right for the start till the end and the actions scenes were pretty good and thrilling. Certain parts of the plot were questionable such as finding the secret tunnel in the library which felt too easy and not realistic. I liked the character of Indiana's dad who had a good personality which made the movie better and funnier."", ""This film has all the wit and charm of Hogan's Heroes. With the exception of a clever opening featuring River Phoenix and some charming moments from Sir Connery, it lurches from one silly scene to another."", 'This review contains spoilers.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. The movie takes place after Raiders of the Lost Ark and concerns Indiana Jones as he looks for the holy grail.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a fantastic third entry into the Indiana Jones trilogy. The third entry combines action, adventure, and surprisingly comedy in one tight and focused movie. Much of the comedy is owed to Sean Connery playing Indiana Jones\' father. This entry is as good if not better than Raiders of the Lost Ark. It is entirely understandable to see why some audiences may prefer Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade over Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is a movie that edges more towards comedic action-adventure.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade does not skimp on the action scenes. This is a movie that took the phenomenal white knuckle action in the previous two movies to different settings. The action set pieces in this movie are absolutely sublime in their execution. It is as if the earlier entries in the franchise were more for the experience in setting up what the audience would like in this movie. The action setup combined to form a blend of busting comedy and intense action that is a wonder to behold.The villains share the same problem as in Raiders of the Lost Ark. The villains are not all that threatening to Indiana Jones and are able to be overcome easily. This acto of being overcome is more bearable than in Raiders of the Lost Ark or Temple of Doom as it is more comical. The comedy from Indiana Jones overcoming the antagonistic political party is phenomenal. A lot of this is owed to Sean Connery\'s performance as Indiana Jones\' father. He comes up with many unique solutions in their predicaments that work in their favor. It was hilarious watching Sean Connery overcome the evil villains through trickery. Sean Connery is a gem in this movie.I highly recommend ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" directed by Steven Spielberg.Grade: A.', 'This is a must see movie for fans of adventure.

Has good plot, a lot of humor, and some emotion too. not to mention plot twists', ""The second sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark is an awesome, beautifully crafted film, and arguably the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy. The film is funnier, classier and far more laid back than the other two woody story lines, mostly because of the introduction of the excellent Sean Connery as Indy's eccentric father. Spielberg and Lucas get back on track after their off the rails first sequel in which to many peoples' horror had none of the Nazis or characters that made Raiders so unique, however, what Spielberg does to make this film a classic is the use of historical data with the swashbuckling storyline of adventure and action. Not to mention that this may well be the greatest feel good film ever made..."", ""1st watched 4/6/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Steven Spielberg): Fun action and witty dialogue abound in this final(we think...) episode in the Indiana Jones three-some.  What this movie lacked as far as special effects it didn't lack in the witty charm brought to the screen by the pairing of Connery & Ford.  From the very beginning to the end it's hard to keep your eyes of the screen following these outrageous adventures and that's the allure of this series.  This film actually tried to put some serious spiritiual overtones into the storyline by searching for the Holy Grail(the cup that Jesus drank from at the last supper) and the myth that it would give everlasting life to those who drank from it.  There are the usual puzzles and hoops that Indiana has to go through to finish this journey(which make no sense from a realistic perspective), but it's obvious from the very beginning that we're watching an un-realistic hero in a movie and that's okay.  All in all this one is a fun ride for the movie-goer which is the ultimate purpose in this one by the ever-entertaining Steven Spielberg.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Costner has a great feel for creating and choreographing complex action scenes. There is one wide shot in particular that contains many actors involved in a number of separate interactions carried out in a masterfully-planned sequence. It is worth watching several times and paying close attention to each individual shootout going on within the larger scene. Costner has mastered the art of filling the screen with complex action.The cast is outstanding and the love story is compelling and not typical Hollywood. As a real Western fan, I enjoyed this one enough to watch it several times. I think the plot offers something for everyone and I think it is one of those rare films that appeals to both men and women. It is certainly worth checking out.', 'Personally, I didn\'t find it long. I\'ve seen many great Westerns--such films as ""Will Penny,"" ""Shane,"" ""The Unforgiven,"" and several other Eastwood movies spring to mind--and this was right up there with them. My thanks to Kevin Costner, Robert Duvall (of course), and Annette Bening for giving me a wonderful experience at the movies. It doesn\'t happen all that often anymore.

Boss requests Mose to return to a small town nearby and buy some supplies for the rest of their journey. Mose never comes back, and Boss and Charley decides to check what happened with him. They find Moses beaten and arrested in the jail by the corrupt Sheriff Poole (James Russo), accused of fighting against the men of a powerful local rancher, Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon). Boss and Charley bring Mose to the local doctor, Barlow (Dean McDermott), where Charley falls in love for his sister, Sue Barlow (Annette Bening). They return to their camping, they are attacked by Baxter\'s men and Mose and Dig are killed and Button is seriously wounded. The two old cowboys return to the town looking for justice. ""Open Range"" is one of the best contemporary western, with the characters very well constructed and an engaging low paced story having action, drama and romance. The performance of the cast, highlighting Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner, and the direction of Kevin Costner are magnificent.

You can tell a lot of heart went into this movie, but, as noted above, the plot twist right at the end felt very much like an afterthought, a way to subvert the expectations on who the real killer was.Still, I have to give credit to Samuel L Jackson and Vincent Cassel for a great performance with the ending they were given.', 'Damaged tries to weave a suspenseful story, but it suffers from some gaping plot holes and predictable twists. The acting is decent, but the characters themselves are a little one-dimensional. The film\'s saving grace, however, is the ending. Leaving serial killer Dan Lawson still at large injects a genuine sense of unease. We\'re left with the chilling knowledge that this monster is still out there, and that possibility keeps the film from being a complete wash.However, that single positive doesn\'t erase the rest of the movie\'s issues. Pacing drags at times, and the reveal of the culprit feels rushed. Overall, ""Damaged"" is a watchable thriller, but it\'s unlikely to leave a lasting impression.

Jackson\'s character drinking constantly from scene one, so it\'s not a spoiler, but what does it add to the plot?And speaking of Jackson, here\'s a good double standard for you:\nThe retirement age for ANY Chicago cop is 63 and yet Samuel L.

Not every suspense movie can be Se7en or sports movie be like Rocky. It's enjoyable and great to move away from all the superheroes movie."", ""I really enjoyed this. I am a big fan of the genre. This reminds me of Seven, Bone Collector and Zodiac. If you like this genre you'll love Damaged. What a twist at the end, would never have worked that out. Don't want to give it away but I read some reviews which said the ending was predictable and I think they are fabricating it all. This has one of the best endings which made the movie so worth while. Jackson is so charismatic he was brilliant. Loved the Scottish contingent, Gianni Capaldi, Kate Dickie and John Hannah. This is a must see. Was great to see Scotland shown in the movie, it always adds character to the movie."", ""Ahhhh the slow fade! It's really nice to see how a veteran actor such as Samuel and Vincent would partner up with an international film crew to help them get their shine on. I mean trust me, if it had not been for these 2, esp Samuel on the covers, I would never have watched this movie and that would have caused me to miss out of some good Scottish actors.With that said, this is clearly a high level B movie but that didn't take away from the quality of story and like I said, acting. I also enjoyed the twist at the end which was nearly ruined by the extended unnecessary ending. All in all, I liked it. I liked how unapologetic they were with the crime scenes. NB. If you can't stand blood or gore crime scenes, this movie isn't for you. 🤣"", ""The acting was so-so. Samuel and Vincent can keep it going long enough to peek some interest, instead of dozing off. But the movie was ruined by the intern in charge of audio. Static noise in conversational scenes, background noise louder than the actors, really distracted away from the immersion. As well as really out of place music. In a good flick you wouldnt notice the music, as it adds to the suspense or drama. Not in this movie, here you'll notice the music and start realising it sounds out of place. Not to mention badly edited, and not fitting the vibe.

So, in essence, here is how it works: there is an abundance of scripts out there so you pick a 1/2 decent one for a few coin, you sign up a few big names for their name apeal but do not demand a lot of on-screen time for them so they can come cheap. So, you pick up 1 or 2 name actors, shoot their scenes over the weekend, and fill the rest of the movie with neatly arranged garbage and viola, you have a Netflix movie recipe for us two waste time on.

Not much of a protracted ending. Some stock side characters. An opening flashback that\'s well, quick as a flash. Everything in between? Well that gets better. That\'s Mercy\'s epicenter.

Mercy, well it doesn\'t hold your hand as a viewer cause it\'s mean as a snake, all B-thriller trope-d and relentless and flinty and un-empathetically violent.

They\'re game and committed in a low-budgeted, claustrophobic version of Die Hard in a clinic. People are trapped, the FBI rolls in, mano-a-manos go down, Meyers gets his rage on, and blood is spilled. The antagonist personas are mob types with thick accents, disheveled haircuts, and itchy trigger fingers. The protagonists are John McClane ilk-s who are stealth and can occasionally gibe.

From the opening five minutes where an FBI prisoner transport is taken out by a couple of gangsters the story goes awry. One previous rater pointed out how idiotic the rooftop running scene is, but the lead actress is rather stunning, so that was perhaps one of the highlights of the film.Lastly, as a veteran I always draw umbrage when film makers don\'t do any research at all. There\'s no such thing as a Gold Medal for Bravery - much less someone who\'s won three of them. AND.

Read all;"[""I had very high expectations and who wouldn't? Ridley Scott directing a great adventure with a very solid cast and a high budget.The movie didn't really start the way I thought it would. The pace was quite slow but very interesting, and I was gripped. The interaction between Robin and his fellow soldiers was quite believable and entertaining, and the story about the English crown succession was also nicely done.The entire chapter about Nottingham and its citizens is also at a nice and slow pace, but its never dull. Von sydow is a pleasure to see as usual, and both Crowe and Cate Blanchett delivers. You just sit and smile, when things suddenly goes very very wrong...It starts when Walter Loxley explains Robins past to him. The scene is rushed and it seems a bit far-fetched. Also the following scene when robin goes to the meeting of the barons. Ridley must at this time peeked at his watch and noticed that he let most of the movie pass without telling much, and start to massacre the script.The Nottingham action scene is where it's starting to go seriously wrong. You can't really get to understand how Robin suddenly is in command of an army, and speaking to lords as their equal. Especially when they call him by his common name in a scene later. The pace is really off here too... Action scene-Action scene-Short grief scene- Love scene- And on horseback against the French again in a 5min gap. Set in contrast to the feelgood mode you were in this is a very rude awakening.After this you are handed a fighting scene that is absurd in every way. The landing craft is from WW2 (what possible use does the landing bridge have on these boats?). The battle is a slaughter, the French never stand a chance(not very interesting). When suddenly Marion appears on the beach with the local teenage runaways on ponies I just shake my head... why?! It's just stupid?! Also they seem to be trained by ninjas and easily takes on trained French soldiers.There is an ending after, but its thrown together in five minutes.In one line.This movie had a lot of potential, but it's thrown away on hasted parts and plain stupid scenes."", 'Forget everything you know about Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood Forest. Wipe away images of those Men In Tights robbing the rich and helping the poor, the pretty damsel Maid Marion, Little John and the dastardly Sheriff of Nottingham. The legend of Robin the Hood gets an overhaul by Ridley Scott and writer Brian Helgeland - and you can hardly recognise the bones of the legend until you get to the end of the movie.Like ""The Dark Knight"", ""Iron Man"" and others, this is another origin movie that sees director Scott teaming up again with Russell Crowe 10 years after Gladiator! Helgeland\'s tale deals with the adventures of Robin Longstride (Crowe), an archer in the Crusading army of Richard the Lionheart, long before he is known to all and sundry as Robin Hood. During a battle against the French, Robin learns of the \'death\' of King Richard and sees it as an opportunity to flee from the army. On his way back to England, he chances upon the critically injured Sir Robert of Loxley (Douglas Hodge) and promises the dying knight that he will take a sword back to his father, Sir Walter Loxley (Max Von Sydow).At Sir Walter\'s home near Nottingham, Robin meets Robert\'s faithful widow Marion (Cate Blanchett) and accepts Sir Walter\'s proposal to masquerade as Robert, his \'prodigal son\'. This means getting involved with the Loxleys\' problems like over-taxation by the town\'s sheriff (Matthew Macfadyen) and helping to protect them from pillaging attacks by King John\'s emissary Godfrey (Mark Strong.Early reports about the script suggested that Robin Hood was supposed to be a villain and the Sheriff of Nottingham the hero. This proved to be false because Scott seeks to be faithful to English history in this re-imagining of the folklore (mostly told in ballads). Indeed, Scott spends a lot of time on the political intrigues of King John\'s (Oscar Isaac) court involving Godfrey, William Marshall (William Hurt) and the Queen, painting a realistic and vibrant portrait of 12th Century England. In fact some of the scenes remind me of the TV series, ""The Tudors"", which had a handful of the same co-stars and extras. And that beach landing sequence is definitely reminiscent of the World War Two landings at Normandy!Anyway, with Crowe and Blanchett in the lead, we can always expect powerful performances and rousing scenes of battles and romance. Even though Blanchett\'s Marion is no maiden, it is easy to root for her because she is as feisty as she is attractive and very handy with a bow and arrow. As for Crowe, it is easy to dismiss his performance as Gladiator Maximus in tights but that may not be accurate. What I would have wished for was for more humour than those provided by Mark Addy\'s Frair Tuck and Scott Grimes\' Will Scarlet. Still, we can look forward to more adventures of the famous archer in the sequels. - By LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)', 'Many have complained that this version is like Gladiator Part 2. Could be, but maybe Robin Hood was more than just a flamboyant character first played by Errol Flynn. Whole armies fight, Robin leads the way and CGI takes over where the gaps appear. It works very well if you can get past the scale issue. There is nothing like an English long bow to even the score!', ""Ridley Scott returns to familiar territory with Robin Hood. Obviously comfortable in the period setting of the film, Scott looks to reignite the flame of good old Mr. Hood. The story, more a reimagining than a retelling, is a weak point in a film that succeeds in taking the audience on an entertaining ride.Robin Hood takes a cue from Batman Begins and Casino Royale, and looks to provide an origin story. Starting on the field of battle, Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) is an archer in King Richard the Lionheart's (Danny Huston) English army. Following a successful day of battle, Robin unwinds with his compatriots Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes), Allan A'Dayle (Alan Doyle) and Little John (Kevin Durand). After Robin reveals his true thoughts concerning the Crusade to the King himself, Robin, Will, Allan and John land in the stocks and are forced to sit out the next day's battle. During the battle, the King catches an arrow in the throat and before dying entrusts the return of his crown to Sir Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge). Robin and his men are freed from the stocks by a young boy and set out to return home. At the same time, the King of France plots to conquer England by enlisting the help of Sir Godfrey (Mark Strong). Godfrey, an Englishman with French allegiance, along with a horde of French soldiers ambush the Royal Guard. Robin and his men happen upon the ambush as it occurs and fight back, killing many while Godfrey escapes. Robin goes to Sir Robert Loxley whose last dying wish is for his sword to be returned to his father. The film then follows Robin as he returns to Loxley's home of Nottingham with the impending French onslaught looming over England's shoulder.The story of Robin Hood can be complicated, and unnecessarily so. To rewrite such a classic story is a daunting task, one that should only be done with good reason, something the film fumbles in trying to present. The beginning of the film sets itself up to craft a different story, giving the audience hope, but becomes tired of the task and takes an easier and more predictable path. Characters are quickly introduced and rarely given depth. I imagined at one point that the writers had a Robin Hood checklist that they were going down during their process";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

""The Count of Monte Cristo, formerly Edmund Dantes is going to get revenge on his friends!!!""

This and Chamberlain's other Dumas tale (THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK) were made so perfectly that I can't help but immediately compare other versions to these nearly perfect films. In light of this, I am surprised that I actually liked this new version so much. While it's hard to say which film I liked better (the Chamberlain or 2002 version), it's easy to agree that they both are wonderful films. Much of the reason I liked this newer version so much is that it was a very romantic film--much more so than the other one. In addition, it was quite polished and beautiful. In fact, for once, I have nothing to really complain about, as it's a good retelling of the story."", ""I agree that the movie doesn't have to be the same as the book.

The main things that I didn't like were the revenge part (awfully lazy made) and the end (kinda Disney-cheesy). For me, the actual storyline is was more enjoyable and entertaining."", 'The Count of Monte Cristo was a film my girlfriend recommended to me, and to be honest, I wasn\'t looking forward to it. Seeing that it was a recent film and was not well known by my friends or colleagues, I was skeptical. After the first 10 minutes, I was hooked. I\'ve never read the book, but I can see why it is such an important piece of literature. The story was riveting and had me at full attention all the way through. This movie was a bit more ""Hollywood"" then I usually like, but it moved at a fast pace so that even a simpleton would enjoy. After seeing this film I am adding this to my books I need to read before I die. Anyone who\'s looking for a good evening movie, this is it. The film isn\'t amazing directed, but the story is so strong it keeps you on the edge of your seat.Rating = B+VideoGameHollywood.com', ""This has to be one of the worst book adaptations I have ever seen. I've read the book about 5 years before I watched the movie and I must say that the book is FANTASTIC, compared to this hogwash. Although I forgot most of the characters' names and parts of the plot, I still recognized a crappy scaled down movie. It's simplified in the usual American style. I apologize to the literate part of Americans who have read the novel which is probably the most popular adventure novel in history.The plot doesn't even match the book. The only true part of the movie is the prison If sequence, and that's also changed, even though that part of the novel piles up to maybe 100 pages! I possibly exaggerated, but since the whole novel is 1000-1300 (depends on the publisher) that's almost a tiny part of the novel, and they had the nerve not get it right! The other aspects of this novel-to-movie adaptation gone horribly wrong are as follows. Most important characters are either gone or changed altogether. Benedetto, Caderousse, Bertuccio, Haydée, Ali, Baptistin are all missing from the movie, with many more to follow. 99% of the script doesn't have anything to do with the plot of the book. Even the fates of Mondego, Danglars and Villefort have been altered. Mondego doesn't commit suicide, Villefort doesn't go to a mental asylum and, most importantly, Danglars isn't forgiven by Dantes.I recommend the mini-series with Gerard Depardieu but it also has changes, but not so much as this brain dead movie. The only complaint about the series, as well as the movie, is the change in the end of the story. Originally Dantes continues his life with Haydee NOT with Mercedes as is depicted in every adaptation.All in all, this is a very f#$#*ed up movie. Don't watch it!

Full of lavish costuming, sumptuous sets, beautiful locations, dashing men, a gorgeous damsel, dank dungeons, the ever popular swashbuckling (whatever that is) etc., all supported with a classic story makes for 2+ hours of solid entertainment. Who could ask for more? Kick back and enjoy this fun adventure flick worth a trip to the video store. (A-)', ""The Count of Monte Cristo. It is a famous story written by Alexandre Dumas, even better known from The Three Musketeers. This 2002 adaptation of Le Comte de Monte Cristo is a good one.The story is about two friends. One of the friends betrays the other and that one is send to a prison on Chateau D'If. He escapes after 13 years, with the help of an older man. I will not tell you the details but this part in prison is a great part. The man tells him where he can find a lot of gold. After he has escaped he wants revenge on all of them who betrayed him. With the gold he finds he becomes the Count of Monte Cristo and his plan can begin. Basically this is the story, with some sub-plots involving Napoleon, some kind of pirates, a magistrate and his father, a new friend and a girl who once was the fiancé of the count, and now is the wife of his former best friend.Everything looked pretty good. The costumes, the setting, everything. Th actors were all terrific. Jim Caviezel as the count, Guy Pearce as his betrayer and especially Richard Harris as the older man in prison. We see the sheriff of Nottingham from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves in a same kind of role he has there, perfect for him, and Luis Guzmán as the new friend. They all do a great job together with director Kevin Reynolds (also Robin Hood) and the rest of the crew. 9/10."", ""I cannot understand why this film got high score. I guess that around 97% of the people that have rated it, did not read the actual book. To those that did though, this film is one of the worst slaughters of a good story. I understand that in adapting a story to the screen, there is a need of shortening it here and editing it there, but this film version is so far from the origin that it becomes a total different story. I'm asking you, why to take a perfect interesting book (that since it was published in 1844) become a bestseller in so many countries and in so many languages) and to change it to a cheap romantic novel? Some would say that it is done so, because of the audience demand, but I say that such demand comes because Hollywood prefer to create bad movies with the commercial attraction to the less intelligent crowd. To any one that had read the unabridged Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo and enjoyed it, this film is nothing but a terrible why of spending over 90 minutes.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

THE PERFECT STORM is definitely one of the best films of 2000, which in itself was a pretty good year for movies, and works because of the characterisation and acting involved, factors which really make us care about the people in the film before putting them through their paces.Nobody really puts a wrong foot here, whether it's George Clooney as the weather-beaten captain who won't take no for an answer, or Mark Wahlberg as a fresh-faced rookie who stays loyal to his captain through the hardest times.

Acting stalwarts Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Ironside also show up to lend some solid support in what is a uniformly excellent cast.The CGI effects of huge 100 foot waves are seamlessly integrated into the actual water used on set, so that you're never less than convinced that what we see is taking place in the ocean - credibility gives this film a big plus. The pacing is slow at first, as we get introduced to the situation, but the build-up and the final battle for survival is phenomenal and breath-taking, which is what a good disaster movie should be. And all the time avoiding the typical clichés which a number of recent movies keep falling into. Also, for a mainstream film, the film is unusually downbeat in a poignant way, made all the more heart-rending due to the fact that it's a true story. THE PERFECT STORM is a film for all the family and a fine example of what a disaster movie should be";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Even the weaker installments I thoroughly enjoyed, so my review is already weighed in favor of this film. I will say even from a critics point of view I thought it was really well done. It's not the standard comic book fairy tale, but more of an intrinsic study of the Wolverine character. He shows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing, far more than previous installments. It's a risky but necessary move to see him operate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any moment. The humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting viewing all the way through. All the supporting roles I found interesting as well. I really enjoyed the presence of Yukio who provided invaluable aide despite Wolverine's incessant protests. I found it nice to see his character finally develop some closure after all the time we've get to see him in all his cinematic installments."", 'Wolverine plus Samurai makes a pretty good combination for me. A great film that is based on the X-Men comic books and movie series.', ""I was very impress on how good the movie was really is. It wasn't as good as 2003's X2, but it was a lot better than 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Still, the movie doesn't match up with any of the previous films very well. That's why the plot holes were so big in the film in this film. We're talking about a franchise who continuity is very washy where it goes, where it came from and what it being present right now. It seem like FOX's Marvel team doesn't know how to handle the X-franchise properly. At less, Disney's Marvel kind of fix the loose-ends of the previous superheroes movies for 2011's Avengers release. I would love to see Marvel under one company sooner than later. Add, Columbia's Spiderman and any licensed Marvel that belong to other companies elsewhere. I don't care who own Marvel, as long as the films are good and make sense. With that, say, I was under the impression that he visit Japan storyline takes place prior to his joining the X-Men in the canon after WWI. Like the comic and the previous movie, he fought in Europe during WWII. So how was he in Japan in WWII? Plus, how does Logan even have memory of the event, if the previous film showed us he took a bullet to the head that made him forget everything that happened to him prior to his operation post-WW2? It wasn't that big of a deal, since I know the movie takes creative license, which is pretty OK in my book. At less, he goes back to Japan just after the Dark Phoenix saga, so this movie fits in with the comic pretty correct there. The Wolverine, is loosely based on Chris Claremont 1982 four-issue spin off comic series that sent Logan to Japan, for which Claremont drafted then-rising-superstar artist Frank Miller. The characters have the same name, but it's doesn't follow the comic book so well. It doesn't work as an adapted as the comic book, but as a movie of its own. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that'll give you a good clue, it's worth watching. After the events from 2006's X-Men Last Stand, Logan (Hugh Jackson) lives as a hermit in the Yukon, tormented by hallucinations memories of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Was Jean just a personification of Logan's guilt, or is it really phoenix in his head with him? Logan then finds himself being seek out by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who works for Shingen Yashida (Hiroyuki Sanada) who wants to offers to transfer Logan's healing abilities into his father's body. Allowing Logan, a chance to live a normal life rather than being curse with immortality. Logan hating the fact that he outlive everybody he has once love, agrees. Logan set out for Japan, once there, he finds that something malicious is being case as Yashida's doctor, Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) plans to use it for a ultimate weapon call the Silver Samurai, a suit made out of Adamantium metal. Logan refused, but Viper weaken Logan's body to the point that the first time in Logan's life, he might die from the poisoning of Adamantium metal in his body. If not the poison, he might die due to the large numbers of Yakuza and Ninjas set out to kill him. In my opinion, the movie's plot could have been better. The movie's plot moves really slow, it's not well spread out, and last a lot of sub-plot got in the way with the main. I really couldn't find Logan falling in love with Yashida Clan member Mariko (Tao Okamoto). There was a lack of chemistry between Jackman and Tao, their characters were well written had the chemistry but the actors did bring that to life. I know, based on the comics, Logan likes Mariko, but in my opinion, I thought Yukio made a better love interest in this film. Better yet, why even have a love interest. It's seems like any female character put into a comic book film is there only for a love interest arch. I wish Mariko had more to offer the film. Mariko remained the useless princess stereotype. It felt like watching a superhero version of Karate Kiba, a martial-arts film starring Sonny Chiba, released in 1973. About Yukio, she is a mutant with the precognitive ability to know when someone will die. Her power wasn't needed. Nor does it makes any sense, in the case of Yashida and Logan toward the end. Fans may hate what they did for Silver Samurai. Silver Samurai look like Super Shredder in my opinion. FYI. The robotic Silver Samurai is in the new comics, so it does somewhat works. What doesn't work is Viper. The model actress is so awful in acting. Her scenes were so cartoony with all those hissing sounds. Was it really all that necessary to include Viper as a mutant, when she works much better as an Captain America villain. While Hugh Jackson did great as Logan. I just wish to see Logan learn more about the Japanese culture. In the comic, he was being trained in martial arts. In the film, he isn't doing anything new. He seem like a fish out of water there. Critics says the film is darken in tone, in my opinion, it wasn't. The action scenes were good. Bullet train scene was over the top, but it was short. Don't watch it in 3D, it was pretty useless .In a mid-credits scene, there is a scene worth watching hyping X-Men: Days of Future Past. Overall: If you're watching it as an action flick, yes it's a good movie. If you're a fan of the Wolverine character and actually know something about this storyline, you'll be quite disappointed, just like the last X-Men. Still, it's fun to watch."", ""Despite the third act being drastically different in tone to the previous two acts (but it's still fun and enjoyable), The Wolverine is an incredible spin-off that's thrilling and emotional, showing the effects of the events of X-Men 3 on Wolverine/Logan. Hugh Jackman gives a reliably incredible performance as Wolverine once again. Hiroyuki Sanada and Rila Fukushima both give great supporting performances. James Mangold's direction is great and the action sequences are fantastic. The music by Marco Beltrami is really good."", ""Walk the Line director James Mangold was tasked with bringing Logan back to the big screen in what is Hugh Jackman's sixth outing as the Wolverine after last making an appearance in an uncredited cameo role in the 2011 hit film X-Men: First Class.The film, which Mangold has said follows on from the 2006 hit film X-Men: The Last Stand which saw the disbandment of the group and the deaths of Jean Gray and Professor Charles Xavier, sees Logan struggling to cope with his past in an uncertain future. With the love of his life dead (Jean Gray, played by Famke Janssen), he finds it tough to find motivation to go on. Haunted by terrorising nightmares and flashbacks of Grey, The Wolverine's strength is most certainly in its dark, gritty portrayal of Logan's problems.After establishing that Logan once saved a Japanese soldiers life by covering him from the blasts of the Atomic Bomb that hit Hiroshima in 1945, that same solider, now the dying billionaire Yashida (Hal Yamonouchi), sends his loyal staff member Yukio (Rila Fukushima) to track him down. Logan's understanding is that it is to say a final goodbye to an old friend, however on arrival he finds that he was taken there under false pretences. He quickly finds himself entangled in the task of saving Yahida's beloved Granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) from harms way, a journey that may just turn out to save himself from his demons as well as the girl he has begun to fall for.The film asks several key questions of Logan and shows a side to him not often seen: vulnerability. Is immortality what Logan truly desires? On his way to self discovery he finds that what he was beginning to see as his greatest weakness is in fact his biggest strength.The Wolverine will have not let any die-hard X-Men fans down in its portrayal of Logan. Jackman's strong performance that gives an intriguing insight into his characters mindset is the real backbone to what is an engaging, yet rather menacing piece of film. Certain questions are left unanswered, as into the motives of certain characters, but the effective blend of intense, but certainly not over-played, fight-sequences and the strength of Jackman's portrayal of the Wolverine sees you looking past these minor faults and being able to easily enjoy the spectacle that Mangold has pieced together.Twitter: @FilmTrance Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Film-Trance/144519832376155?ref=hl"", 'Usually plot holes are isolated.

This is supposed to be an adaptation of Collin Wilson\'s novel ""The Space Vampires"". A crew on a mission to track Haley\'s comet encounters a huge abandoned spaceship. The ship contains the remains of huge bat like creatures and three nude beautiful humanoids. But then mission control loses contact with ""The Churchill"". The rescue mission finds The Churchill damaged, but the bodies of the nude humanoids remain intact and are returned to earth - bad idea. Meanwhile an escape pod with surviving astronaut Col. Tom Carlsen is found in Texas. He is flown to London (why?), where he tells first one tale of what happened on the ship, then another, then still another. The bottom line is that the three naked humanoids from space are the original vampires, they threaten earth with all of their ""soul sucking"", and Carlsen has a psychic link to the beautiful female with whom he seems to be in love.The story is hard to piece together because it shape-shifts more than the vampires themselves. The first half is investigative in nature - why are these vampires here?, what do they want? , where have they gone?, how can they be defeated?. That morphs into the space vampires running rampant in London, harvesting human souls and turning their victims into zombies - why?. Other than producing great special effects, that is never clear.It seemed like a wasted opportunity overall, but scene by scene it is beautiful to look at, and like the female space vampire herself, creepy yet attractive. As the end credits rolled I wondered what happened here. You have well known director Tobe Hooper and a good supporting cast including Patrick Stewart and Peter Firth. But then I saw that it was produced by the Cannon Group at a time when they had received an infusion of cash by Michael Milken. This caused them to go on a spending spree for special effects and big names and neglect screenplay, ultimately imploding about five years after this film was made.I\'d say that it would be easy for this to become a guilty pleasure of mine and I would recommend it just on the weirdness factor alone.', 'Though it hardly compares to other sci-fi film giants like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, LIFEFORCE does work as a totally berserk and bizarre melding of science fiction and horror elements.

I actually found Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz to be entertaining additions, but the story felt cobbled together and it was riddled with plot holes. I know Natasha is a very skilled assassin, for instance, but she's almost invulnerable in this. It probably would have been better to give Black Widow her solo film a year or two after Iron Man 2 came out."", ""Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson) must deal with a villain from her past and her long-absent family.LOUD, confusing and far too long. It starts off OK but quickly falls apart and becomes confusing and convoluted. The film is also way too long--it doesn't need to run over 2 hours. There's also tons of CGI at the end--way too much. The acting is OK. In short a long forgettable MCU movie."", 'After many years and many movies, Black Widow, one of the original Avengers, finally got a movie. And while it wasn\'t anything groundbreaking, it was still a fun watch. Taking into consideration the splash of spy genre, a pack of new and interesting characters, plenty of action and intensity, I\'d say this wasn\'t a bad movie. It\'s something exciting, while not totally memorable in the large expanse of the MCU. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh both did great. David Harbor\'s character was good and definitely became a favorite in the movie, but I think he still has some things to unravel. The ending ""big reveal"" was kind of mediocre, but the final fight swept it under the rug mostly. Hopefully we\'ll get more of some of these characters in the future so they\'ll have the time they need to grow. Overall, if you haven\'t watched it and want a movie to watch while you\'re bored, I\'d recommend this one.', ""The film isn't likely to go down in Marvel history as much more than a footnote, nor does it tell us much about the studio's next phase. The pieces are great, but the execution leaves plenty to be desired. After an entire year of no Marvel movies on the big screen, it's difficult not to recommend this as worthy escapist popcorn fun. But that's it."", ""I don't quite understand the hate the movie is getting. Too many people expected full comic book accuracy with Taskmaster, which would have been hard to accomplish and harder to fit in the story they were trying to tell. I understand the disappointment from fans who expected that full Taskmaster story, but do not think it means that this movie was a flop. Florence Pugh was excellent in the film and the chemistry between her and Scarlett Johansson was great. Good fighting sequences except for parts of the third act where the CGI was very noticeable. Plus that end credit scene was amazing. One of my only complaints is that Marvel stated you wouldn't need to watch the shows to understand the movies but if you hadn't seen falcon and the winter solider the end credits may not make a 100 percent sense. At least make it clear the shows are a must watch if you are going to make them necessary to understand certain things. Overall a great movie."", 'More than a decade after her debut, Marvel\'s first female Avenger finally receives a solo outing.It\'s hard to say the wait was worth the experience (though seeing a Marvel film on the big screen for the first time in nearly two years could arguably fit that description) because as good as ""Black Widow"" is - and it\'s really good - it almost feels too little, too late for one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\'s most endearing characters and the woman who brought her to life, Scarlett Johannson.As fans remember (don\'t read past this point if you haven\'t seen ""Avengers Endgame"") Romanoff met her end on Vormir as the required sacrifice to obtain the Soul Stone to complete the Infinity Gauntlet needed to reverse Thanos\' attack. ""Black Widow"" sidesteps the fact that her character is currently dead in the main continuity by serving as a prequel movie that takes place after the events of ""Captain America Civil War,"" which saw Romanoff and many of her fellow Avengers go on the run after refusing to sign the Sokovia Accords, and ""Avengers Infinity War."" The movie takes place immediately following the events of ""Civil War,"" with Romanoff setting up a new, quiet life for herself until she receives a strange message from her sister, Florence Pugh\'s Yelena.Black Widow\'s past has only been hinted at in the franchise up to this point. Everyone knows she was a former Russian operative working for the Red Room, a secretive group of highly trained assassins, but nothing beyond that has ever been revealed - until now. The movie opens with an almost surreal picturesque family life of 1980s Ohio with young Natasha and her sister playing in their backyard before dinner. David Harbour makes an appearance as the loving father before receiving a phone call that reveals this family is nothing more than a Russian plant. Think FX\'s brilliant ""The Americans"" show. Romanoff\'s picturesque family life was never real. They were never a real family, but were instead put together for the mission. Natasha and Yelena were never sisters and Harbour\'s Alexei was never their father.For the vast majority of the film, the script keeps the stakes relatively limited. At its core, ""Black Widow"" is a movie about family and accepting the people around you as your family. The story beats emphasize this, as Romanoff reconnects with Yelena and then Alexei on a mission to free the remaining members of the Red Room, who are now brainwashed. Romanoff is in conflict with herself about the nature of her relationships to these people as she is with the enemies that are trying to kill her. It\'s only when accepting that Alexei and Yelena are her family bound by something more important than blood - just as she was bound to the Avengers - that she is able to overcome her challenges.And then the movie devolves into a CG-filled final act that features the trademark Marvel Studios quota for explosions and weightless action. For the last 30 minutes, ""Black Widow"" forgets all of the soul searching its characters have done and all of the revelations they have uncovered to throw them into a meat grinder of non-stop action. It\'s well directed action, but it feels like a tonal shift from all that\'s come before.""Black Widow"" at least tries to offer something slightly deeper than the standard Marvel fare. The opening credits are downright haunting with images of the girls of the Red Room being abducted and subjugated to abuse and torture. As much as the movie is about family, it\'s also about how society treats women as things before casting them aside when they\'re no longer useful. But as is the problem with many films of this type, the imagery is there, but more so as window dressing to serve the narrative, than as a political statement.The relationships at the core of the film are better developed than perhaps any other individual movie. Johansson and Pugh have amazing chemistry, and the latter absolutely steals the spotlight - perhaps setting herself up as the Black Widow successor in the upcoming franchise. Even Harbour\'s failure of a Soviet super soldier is entertaining to watch, as he\'s constantly trying to compare himself to Captain America, Steve Rogers.""Black Widow"" is the solo film that Romanoff deserved, but it just feels as if it\'s fulfilling a long overdue obligation, rather than as a true entry in the MCU. Certain story beats hit a little harder knowing Romanoff\'s ultimate fate, and its overall theme of identity and discovering self worth fits in with the current slate of Disney+ MCU shows, but it still feels like this movie would have been much better suited to release before the ""Avengers"" duology.', 'There was a real opportunity with this film. It could have been a gritty backstory about a difficult upbringing. That would have been interesting. They could have made Natasha all Jason Borne\'d up and showed her dark espionage skills. That would have been interesting. The training of an assassin and the emotional dichotomy of a paid killer. That too would have been interesting.Instead we got two hours of unimaginite ""plot"" with phoned in dialogue delivered by bored actors riddled with Clichés and borrowed scenes from other, much better movies (and I bever thought I would say that about Moonraker) .

If you have characters played by the likes of Denzel Washington, why the need to hit us over the head with a self conscious blow of irrational cutting taking me out of the movie completely and forcing me to see the movie as a movie, the actors as actors and the drama as sheer fiction. Washington is superb. Slowly but surely I'm warming up to the man. I've always admired his performances but there was something about the actor, a veil of arrogance perhaps, that stopped me from getting closer.

I really enjoyed the film,and had me hooked from start to finish.Added blood and gore in there, but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film, and even had a tear jerker ending for many people i should think.It is a must watch for anyone. Seen many reviews, slating the film, but to be fair, most the films that get bad reviews, turn out to be some of the best. this proves it once again.Rent this film, buy this film, just go out and watch this film. You will not be disappointed.', ""Straight to main points on what I think was wrong with this movie: the absolute fail is the edit, with it's method of semi photo semi video with random flashes on the screen with double vision effects... Typical mid 2000's thing that messed up couple of other movies. But you would think a good film maker would recognize the fact that it's annoying and unprofessional.On top of that couple of highly illogical plot turns and some cliche lines really setting this movie back. With very overused soundtrack that played every 10 minutes of the movie.All that being said, this does have some good acting and action, overall keeps you on the edge of your seat. Strong 6 stars, just again, this damn camera work is absolute annoying trash !"", ""There are a lot of things to like about this film: the plot, the characters, and the photography are great. Denzel Washington carries the story beautifully, and watching the relationship between his and Dakota Fanning's characters evolve during the first half is in my opinion the best part of the whole movie.Unfortunately, the viewing experience is largely diminished by the editing. I found the fast-forward-like, jittery sequences meant to show time or emotional breaks in the story are a major distraction. I really believe the film would have been as good without all that flash.\nAs it is, it feels like music video clips or cheap action TV show sequences being forced into a story that otherwise aspires to be something bigger.I was also disappointed to see the tropes of torture and rough interrogation used so heavily in the second half of the film."", 'i liked this film a lot. it\'s dark, it\'s not a bullet-dodging, car-chasing numb your brain action movie. a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague, leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions. it\'s nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own minds.in the end, motivated by love or vengeance, or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is ""right"". \'will god ever forgive us for what we\'ve done?\' - it\'s not a question mortal men can answer - so he does what he feels he has to do, what he\'s good at, what he\'s been trained to do.denzel washington is a great actor - i honestly can\'t think of one bad movie he\'s done - and he\'s got a great supporting cast. i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone.', ""This is by far one of the better made movies and  didn't leave me disappointed at all. The sound track along with finely  shot hand-held camera work was exquisite . The are always chances a  movie won't hold ones beliefs as well as another, but I felt that  rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent. Dakota Fanning is  rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old  soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent. As  for Mr. Washington and of course Christopher Walken they both exceed  the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move  to the light."", 'I hate preachy revenge flicks. I pay money to go see a revenge movie, I want revenge -- not some tough guy learning that killing is bad, etc. Seriously, if I wanted a sermon on the importance of turning the other cheek, I\'d either go to church or rent an eco-friendly Steven Seagal movie.I\'m a big fan of the revenge genre, there\'s something about the build-up that gets my blood boiling. I love getting attached to characters and feeling their vengeance, which is why I love revenge movies that go all-out and feature TRUE revenge.COLLATERAL DAMAGE is a good example of a movie that just backed itself into a wall. It starts as a revenge movie and ends as a message against terrorism, war, and violence. In an Arnold Schwarzenegger film? Give me a break.So I had never expected to see such hardcore material in MAN ON FIRE -- it\'s an all-out action thriller that takes no prisoners. When Denzel stuck a stick of dynamite up a man\'s anus, then blew him up, I thought, ""Wow, this movie really isn\'t afraid of offending people.""Washington\'s character isn\'t likable which is part of the reason this succeeds. Most revenge movies feature heroes who, magically, don\'t seem to want to kill anybody. However in this, Creasy (Washington) is a bodyguard who avenges the death of a little girl (Dakota Fanning) and he does so with more than mere vengeance. ""I\'m going to kill everyone,"" he says, and then does, with no pity and no remorse.In fact this actually reminded me of the Tom Clancy novel ""Without Remorse,"" only it\'s even better. Scott is at the top of his game here, revolutionizing subtitles along the way and adding an unmistakable grain to his movie that only helps it become more memorable as a gritty revenge flick.It also features both Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke -- the Kings of Cool -- in the same film together. That right there makes the film worth seeing.I agree with Quentin Tarantino. This is one of Tony Scott\'s best films and a great, hard-as-nails revenge movie -- I had expected little and got back a lot. A definite must-see, and an Oscar-worthy performance by Washington.One of 2004\'s most underrated films. How did this get 30% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes?!4.5/5', 'Gave up on this film. The trendy camera made me feel queasy.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The movie grounds itself in reality while keeping a mythological and fantasy-esqe tone, and it never loses sight of the humanity within the characters, with elevates this above standard superhero fare.', ""Great movie! Has a comic book feel to it. The storyline is very well done! I love how they show Asgard and explain how everything fits into place. The humor is very tasteful, but can be oddly quirky in places. Lots of fun action. The only thing that could have used some improving was the way they filmed the movie. The shakey camera and weird angles are a little annoying, but the rest of the film makes up for this. Very good choice in the cast, could not have picked a better actor for Thor or Loki. Natalie Portman's part isn't the best. She has cheesy lines and her acting doesnt flow right, even though she is a talented actress. She does better with serious parts inatead of light and comical. This movie is very clean and makes a great fun movie for the entire family."", ""It is crazy to see how much Thor has changed since his first movie. Talk about a character arc! From arrogant, bleached eye-browed man to one of the most loveable personalities. I like how this focused mainly on Thor and Loki's relationship, but also feels a little corny when he is on earth."", 'Who knew Thor was the perfect drinking buddy and is domesticated lol? Perfect writing. Perfect directing. Perfect casting. Perfect cinematography. Perfect amount of S/VFX. Perfect score. Perfect comedy/drama/thrills. Etc... 10/10', ""Given his Godly nature, Thor could have easily been the most difficult member of The Avengers to translate to screen. Any fears have soundly been laid to rest though, as Kenneth Branagh and his team have pulled together several interpretations of the character, to create perhaps the most definitive version of Thor yet. Despite a somewhat information laden opening, the backstory of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the family dynamic between his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and jealous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is fantastically realised, in a beautifully architected Asgard. Simultaneously seeming archaic and futuristic, Asgard perfectly fits the film's ideology that magic and science are one in the same, something that I think will translate perfectly as the Marvel films start to more deeply explore the other worldly nature of the Marvel Universe. The marketing boys did a grand job of not letting on just how much of the film is set there and the production team created a breathtaking realm through a combination of CGI, outlandish sets and costumes.The film is at it's best when the father-son triangle relationship is being explored, with Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Hopkins all giving very different but equally as impressive performances. Hemsworth's physical, fun loving, but fiery tempered Thor gives the film its heart, particularly during his tenure on Earth, whilst his jealous and manipulative brother Loki, is given layers of depth by Hiddleston, who has created perhaps the most memorable on- screen Marvel villain yet. However, it's Anthony Hopkins' Odin, who steals every scene he is in. Despite his lack of knowledge of the source material, he applies himself to the role using every ounce of his shakespearean nature and overpowers louder performances with a whisper. Much of the supporting cast is never given much time to shine, with Natalie Portman's role being particularly under developed, whilst Sif and the Warrior's Three are entertaining if not particularly memorable. Amongst all of this heartfelt drama, is also a brilliant action blockbuster. You will believe that Gods can fly and the climactic battle between Thor and Loki is better than anything the Iron Man movies produced. And whilst there is the cross-over element as with the other Marvel films so far (including a scene involving a certain archer and the almost obligatory post credits moment), it's nowhere near as jarring and enables Thor to stand on its own two feet. It's just made me that much more excited to see the God of Thunder alongside the rest of Earth's heroes. I only hope that Captain America: The First Avenger is this good."", ""Straight to the point, this was not only one of the better ones, its one of the few really good ones. I'm sure anyone reading this knows what i'm getting at, they either get these right or they get them wrong. Well this ones right, very right, from start to finish, epic, spectacular, warm, funny, action packed. The story draws you in, the characters are likable, the pace is just right, doesn't race along, but doesn't plod either. Great cast, particularly Chris Hemsworth, if Captain America and Green Lantern can keep up this standard then it'll be a good summer season.Ken's pulled it all together. Go and watch it, i cant imagine you wont enjoy it and if you think i'm being paid to say this then get stuffed !!"", 'This is Thor! Not the guy in Ragnarok and Love and Thunder. The plot for this movie is a simple and easy to follow movie with a like able villain. I will say the movie did not have me engaged. The theme is the generic ""Who am I? What\'s my potential?"" theme. The acting and dialogue is good. And the editing is well paced and the effects are good for 2011. I love the music as it fits the cosmic and mythology side of things. There\'s not much to say about this other than it\'s good but has flaws. The Thor franchise is my least favorite in the MCU though. But I\'d say Kenneth Branagh did a decent job at introducing Thor into the MCU. Not one of a kind or anything special though. Definitely watch this for the Avengers though! 7.5/10. C.', 'Kenneth Branagh, the man who brought us Shakespearean masterpieces such as \'Hamlet\' and \'Henry V\', directs \'Thor\', a marvelous summer-starter (even though there\'s still one month till summer begins).\'Thor\' stars Chris Hemsworth, a relatively unknown actor, as, you guessed it, Thor. Now from the trailers, it seemed to me that this was going to be yet another wannabe superhero flick with kick ass special effects and fight scenes, lacking any depth, and starring a talentless six-pack. Well I was wrong. \'Thor\' is probably Marvel\'s best film, and I\'d even go as far as saying that it is the third best superhero film of all time (right behind Christopher Nolan\'s masterpieces).The plot is as follows... Thor, the bloodthirsty warrior and heir, is banished from the eternal kingdom of Asgard by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), after disobeying his command, to a distant realm... called Earth! Now he needs to get back, but his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who was previously living in Thor\'s shadow, is proclaimed temporary king after his father collapses on a staircase, or something, and he doesn\'t want to let his cool brother back home, so Thor has to stay on Earth, with all the puny beings. He then falls in love with Jane (Natalie Portman), who is somewhat of a scientist, and changes his mind from ""kill everybody who threatens my well-being"" to ""now wait a second, let\'s reason a bit here"".The movie\'s directed by Kenneth Branagh, the director of masterpieces such as \'Henry V\', in which his also starred in, and received two Oscar nominations for both directing and acting. He may also be known to some as the goof-ball professor Gilderoy Lockhart from \'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\'. Here, he takes a break from acting, or producing, or writing, and just directs this masterpiece. Hollywood is really heading in the right direction with hiring artsy directors to direct explosion-explosion films. Another great example would be the upcoming \'Captain America: The First Avenger\', directed by Joe Johnston, who brought us the very good coming-of-age story, \'October Sky\'. I hope \'Captain America\' is gonna be as good as \'Thor\'. A part inside me somehow doesn\'t want it to be better, I don\'t why though.Alongside Hemsworth, star Jane\'s friends Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), and Darcy... something (Kat Dennings)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Whatever you may think of Mr. Cruise, I happen to agree after watching this film.  Although I had trouble following the story at times, it was a lot of fun, and Ritchie managed to juggle all the characters around and keep me interested and compelled to watch.  I also didn\'t have any trouble understanding what the characters were saying, and I think those who blind themselves to films like this by saying, ""Oh, I can\'t understand them"" lack patience.  I also liked all the actors, particularly, of course Lenny McLean and Vinnie Jones(one of my few complaints is I would have liked to see more of them in the film). And for a film which feels violent, there\'s surprisingly little actual violence, which is refreshing.  Overall, not a particularly deep film, but a lot of fun.', ""Best comedy in years, friend turned me on to this hilarious comedy of errors and glad she did. The film is damn near flawless, forces you to pay attention to the twists and turns through it's witty dialogue. Wonderfully photographed with brilliant camerawork but not overdone. Worth several sittings and we could learn alot in Hollywood from this one...."", ""I really cant see why this film is so highly rated. In my eyes it's just a complete mess and Ritchies worst film. Compared to Snatch, this has nothing on it, not even close. The other critics on this website debate that Lock Stock has a better ending and story, but i didn't really see that. The pacing of Lock Stok is astonishingly slow and the characters feel like their cardboard cutouts without a soul. This also brings a negative thrall over this poorly directed and acted mess.I cant begin to tell you how much i disliked the cast, i mean awful. The choices of picking some actors like Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran and Steven Mackintosh is just like picking up anyone of the street and saying they will do. It's not on. And despite not having ever heard of any of them, i wish i hadn't now."", ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is set in London where four close friends Eddie (Nick Moran), Bacon (Jason Statham), Tom (Jason Flemying) & Soap (Dezter Fletcher) all chip in £25,000 to make up the £100,000 entrance fee to a big high stakes poker game held by hard as nails villain & crime boss 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty). Eddie is an expert poker player & figures he can make each of them a clear £100,00 profit, if they play their cards right (ha!). Unfortunately 'Hatchet' Harry doesn't like losing & cheats, Eddie not only loses the £100,000 but actually ends up owing 'Hatchet' Harry £500,000 after borrowing it from him to continue in the game. 'Hatchet' Harry is not the sort of person you owe money to, Eddie & his friends must find a way to raise a half a million pounds in the next four days or start losing their fingers...This English production was written & directed by Guy Ritchie & has already deservedly reached pretty much classic status, in fact it still resides in the IMDb's top 250 films list over ten years since it was originally released & for me it throughly deserves to be there. It's just a wonderfully entertaining, witty, funny, clever British crime caper with bags of personality & at the time it was made originality although in the ten years since it was released many a British film has ripped it off trying to recreate it's success. There are a few things which make Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels so brilliant. First it's just so funny, I have seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels several times now & I laugh my head off every time, the really funny dialogue, the spot on performances, the hilarious one liners, the use of funny cockney rhyming slang & the things which happen along with the often bizarre situations the character's find themselves in means there isn't a scene that goes by where something funny doesn't happen or there isn't some instantly quotable insult or one liner. Secondly the character's are great, they have real depth & the good guy's are very likable so you root for them while the bad guy's are real nasty pieces of work so as a consequence you don't root for them, just the way it should be. Then there's the plot which at the time was fresh, new, original, clever, witty, full of great twists & turns & there's certainly plenty going on which rather improbably all come together at the end in a somewhat far fetched way but when a film is as entertaining, clever & downright funny as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels you just tend to go with it. A brilliantly funny British comedy crime caper, one of my favourite films ever & it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Ritchie really injects some style, pace & energy into the film with various tricks which never become gimmicky or intrusive & only help tell a brilliantly story with style, originality & panache. Not only did Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels revolutionise the British crime caper genre with it's story telling but it has also influenced plenty of films since with it's slick editing & visual techniques. There's a fantastic soundtrack too, I really can't think of one bad thing to say about Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels which is pretty high praise in itself as I am not easily pleased. There's a fair amount of violence but nothing overly graphic & a lot of it is played for laughs as is the bad language & profanity of which there is a lot. In fact I don't there is a single scene which doesn't involve the use of strong language at some point.According to the IMDb Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels had a budget of about £960,000 which is simply amazing, a film this good & this stylish for less than a million? Shot on location in & around London Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels were the film debuts of both ex footballer Vinnie Jones & Jason Statham who have both done very well off the back of it. During the final credits the film is dedicated to ex bare knuckle fighter Lenny McClean who played Barry the Baptist & who died of cancer shortly before the film premiered. The acting is great from all involved, there's boyish charm to downright menacing criminal unpleasantness.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a brilliantly funny, witty, clever & entertaining British crime caper that is a true genre great & one of my own personal favourite films ever. Ritchie followed Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels up with the equally brilliant British crime caper Snatch (2000) a couple of years later."", ""This film's plot starts off a bit convoluted but gradually meshes together like clockwork, with every scene and line having significance. The varying plotlines weave in and out with expert craft, always leaving the audience wondering what will happen next and never alienating them. These are all funny in a subtle, situational way - muted reactions to extraordinary events, chance encounters and thwarted masculine bravado. The characters are exaggerated, the style is frenetic and the environment is gritty and urban. These all amount to an expertly made crime-comedy with a unique British 90s music video feel."", 'After being in love with ""Snatch"", my cousin and I began to look out for this film and finally we saw it on a bootleg of the imported DVD. That was about 3 or 4 years ago and the last year I saw for the very first time the Region 4 DVD so I get my own copy of the film and enjoyed for the second time. Last week I saw ""The Transporter"" and I decide to enjoy once again this magnificent work so I\'m here writing, after a third view, my thoughts about Guy Ritchie\'s first feature film.The story introduce you this four friends: Eddie (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), Bacon (Jason Statham) and Soap (Dexter Fletcher). They have different ways to get money but finally they decide to enter in a big game. They put together £100,000 to play a card game, taking advantage of the great abilities of Eddie. But they are playing against ""Hatchet"" Harry (P.H. Moriarty) who is a porn king and now they owns him £500,000 and Harry is the kind of man that if you own him you better pay him. I really love how the story makes that you care and, at the same time, feel sorry for the four friends because they put in that card game all of their savings and now they need a real miracle to get the money in only one week. At the same time were are watching this, we also watch some other characters that, if you think first, doesn\'t have anything related with the four friends but you will see how little is the world. There are many secondary characters but basically there are just group of friends and partners: the drug growers, the criminal neighbors of Eddie, the two guys from the North and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) with his son, Little Chris. And all know Harry and Rory (Vas Blackwood) that are the ""big bosses"". There are two more characters that are the ones that connect everything, specially the second one: Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean) and Nick the Greek (Stephen Marcus). This story might look a little complicated with a lot of connected subplots but the way that is shown is just perfect, enjoyable and easy to follow. The style of Guy Ritchie is just so cool, for example the first sequence is just brilliant, and there are many funny situations just as many ironies in the entire story, being the one in the very end the biggest of all.Cast: Just brilliant. Eddie could be the main character and Nick Moran is just great. Jason Statham is great but he has a support role as part of the four friends so he doesn\'t stand out of the four because the four are a team and are great. As I watched first ""Snatch"" I found here many familiar faces like Vinnie Jones and Alan Ford. The last one has a very small role as the bartender but he is also the narrator with his unique voice. Also Sting appears as Eddie\'s father making a really good performance and ""the hardest man in Britain"", Lenny McLean, is terrific as Barry.Conclusion: Well for me this is nothing but a brilliant film. Great story, great characters, funny situations with a lot of irony. I mention in this comment many times the film ""Snatch"" and the only reason is because is a similar film, brilliant too so I highly recommend both. In this case ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" deserves a perfect and beautiful 10.', 'Guy Ritchie\'s London is where getting shot in the head is easy. Bugai walk around the city in leather jackets and with the appearance of former football players who are extremely hard at knocking out debts. And it\'s a no brainer that if you and your friends have 100,000 pounds sterling - in no case should you sit down to play poker with a local authority who can, in a fit of anger, extremely ingeniously beat people with half-meter rubber dildos. No brainer, but Eddie (Nick Moran) and his three buddies - Bacon (Jason Statham), Tom (Jason Fleming) and ""Soap"" (Dexter Fletcher) - no. The guys are in debt. And, in a big way. So now they need bigger guns.', 'Guy Ritchie has made a superb first movie, and I hope he continues to make more films. All the characters are excellent, and Vinnie Jones and Lenny McLean are both superb. Altogether, an excellent film.', ""Bacon (Jason Statham), Eddy (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), and Soap (Dexter Fletcher) are lifelong friends. Eddy is the card player. Bacon, and Tom are hustlers. Soap is straight and legal. They pull together the money to go into Harry 'The Hatchet' big card game. Harry rigs the game and the guys are down £400,000. Harry gives them a week before his muscle Barry the Baptist takes care of them. They decide to rob their drug dealing neighbor. Meanwhile Barry is looking to steal a priceless antique shotgun but it ends up in the hands of the four friends.This is heavily influenced by Quentin Tarantino and that's not a bad thing. This is Guy Ritchie's full length feature debut. It shows that he has skills but it's not quite as polished as 'Reservoir Dogs'. The accents are quite thick. The comedy doesn't always translate well. However Ritchie has got the style down. This also introduced Jason Statham to the movie world."", ""From director Guy Ritchie (Snatch), Lock and Stock, set in the suburbs of London in the 1990s, follows the story of four lifelong friends who, after winning a hundred thousand pounds, get into a high-stakes card game and lose because it was rigged, they are forced by Harry the Ax to pay five hundred thousand pounds in one week.One of Ritchie's most famous films with that approach to the film in which throughout the film he presents different linked stories that lead to the same outcome in a ridiculous way that gives it that point of dark comedy.A well-made film with that open ending and that comical touch that it has makes it a cult film.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Most of that had to do with the retelling of the origin, and fundamentally I agree that this probably wasn't necessary after only ten years since the Tobey McGuire version. But now that I've seen it, I can say my second thoughts were unwarranted because this film provides an adrenaline rush with every spider web fired.I always had this unsettled feeling with the McGuire Spider-Man, or more accurately, with the McGuire Peter Parker. I found him to be too much of a wuss, wimping out whenever confronted as the timid teenager. With Andrew Garfield, I didn't get the impression he was OK to let things go whenever a bully came on the scene. With only one picture under his belt as opposed to Tobey's three, I'm going with the new kid in town.Whether intended or not, I also preferred the darker tone to this take on the Spidey character. Many of the action scenes occurred at night and better conveyed a sense that this costumed hero might be more of a menace than a friend. Peter Parker's dinner clash with Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) helped push that agenda and it worked pretty well.As for the main villain, a mixed reaction. There were times The Lizard (Rhys Ifans) looked a bit corny and other times truly menacing. It seemed to me that the film had trouble establishing the villain's proportion in relation to Spider-Man and other humans. In some scenes he looked like a monster, at others merely somewhat larger than Spider-Man. However the concept of cross-species genetics on which The Lizard came to being was handled rather well and proved effective.As always, my favorite moment in a Marvel hero movie did not leave me disappointed. Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance once again, this time as the oblivious librarian listening to a symphony while Spidey and The Lizard make a shambles of the bookcases in the background. I can't believe he'll be ninety at the end of this year."", 'IMO, i think the super A plus to this movie is the realistic application of physics. It shows a more limited spiderman. He must operate within parabolic physics and they tie that into the story.I thought this spiderman was a more fun, spunkier, angstier Peter Parker. He was definitely way more nerdy than Toby Mcguire.The addition of Gwen was great and I really look forward to seeing how this franchise manages upcoming installments under the new label.Dialogue was slightly lame, key point being, ""Gwen! Gwen! I understand! Your boyfriend is a man of many masks!"" CHEESY!!!!My other knock was that it spent the entire time developing the angst of peter parker and didn\'t give enough development to Gwen, Aunt May, and Doc. Connor.I am a huge marvel guy, so i will continue to watch with a sense of forgiveness for the many flaws that Comic to Movie translations present.I am glad I waited for DVD because so few movies obtain that silver screen quality. If you liked this movie check out the other Marvel and DC titles. They are doing some decent work.', 'The Amazing Spider-Man begins with Peter Parker in high school. Though an amateur photographer, Peter\'s main interest is science - and he bluffs his way into an audience with his deceased father\'s ex-partner Dr Curt Connors. After impressing Connors with his knowledge of cross- species genetics, Peter enters a classified area and is bitten by a mutated spider. As his powers and secret identity develop, so too does his relationship with Connors protégé, and Parker\'s classmate, Gwen Stacey. But when the desperate Connors attempts to fight his personal weaknesses using the same untested method, he undergoes a more disastrous transformation into ""The Lizard"", a creature with a twisted view of how best to \'cure\' humanity.The Amazing Spider-Man\'s origin story is undoubtedly an improvement on Raimi\'s Spider-Man, a decade prior. The characterisation is a lot more realistic, which makes it easier for the audience to feel Parker\'s teenage pain, awkwardness and ultimate escapism when he dons the guise of Spider-Man. Emma Stone\'s Gwen Stacey is also a welcome replacement for Mary-Jane, who\'s sole purpose in Raimi\'s films was either to moan or scream. Stacey by contrast, is an intelligent character in her own right, who doesn\'t shy away from getting her hands dirty when Spider- Man\'s in trouble. Rhys Ifans portrayal of Curt Connors has the same Jekyllian vulnerability seen in Mark Ruffallo\'s Bruce Banner earlier this year, although his motives are distorted somewhat as the film progresses.However, such interesting character development unfortunately does not hold together perfectly with the action.

A final return to the street racing scene had to move away from the original cast as they had lost their 'From the streets' appeal.Anyway back to this, some sweet cars that aren't the massively expensive hyper cars of later episodes and some trick driving to boot.A quality film if you manage to watch it a couple of times and don't dwell on the accent."", ""The first film was BREAK POINT with cars. The second one was Miami VICE with cars. This is REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE... with more cars. To be honest, I kinda liked this one better than the last two, despite Lucas Black somehow beating Paul Walker as the least charismatic actor in a starring role. What I mainly like is the direction by Justin Lin. The focus on police undercover stories is dropped in favor of the street racing culture and its connections to the mob. Was actually delighted to see Sonny Chiba appear, I must have missed his name during the opening credits. Purely as a movie about car action, I think it succeeds better than the first two. There's a goofy quality to it that kinda helps one go along with things. Best to sum that up is Lucas Black smiling like a dork with blood on his teeth, living for the thrill. That's probably what this film series needed, and less soap opera/undercover drama. Consider me surprised."", 'I\'m getting the feeling that the majority of reviews here as of June 14th are bogus.

It\'s over the top, has cheesy dialogue, and has an unlikeable protagonist. With that said, it\'s actually pretty entertaining, and isn\'t all that bad.We are introduced to Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), a high school kid who can\'t seem to find his niche in life. He\'s moved from town to town with his divorced mother, and getting into problems with the law, before finding himself in Southern California. The California scenes pay homage to Justin Lin\'s earlier film, Better Luck Tomorrow, almost feeling like an extension of that film. We see the crowds of students in the courtyard, almost peripheral to a particular point in time. Moving to California doesn\'t change anything, and Sean, the outsider, finds himself racing Clay (Zachery Ty Bryan, from Home Improvement), a rich kid who has it all, including a brand new Dodge Viper.In trouble with the law yet again, Sean finds himself moving to Japan, for reasons that aren\'t particularly clear.

There are newer, more advanced forms of 3-D entertainment, but director Rodriguez decided to go with the old fashioned 1950s variety - resulting in a virtually colorless mess of hazy images rushing past the audience's confused, aching eyes for an hour and a half. If they release a non-3-D version on DVD, wait for that and enjoy what little screen time was given to Ricardo Montelban, who steals what little entertainment value this stinker manages.

This film does have substance enough to keep you watching through the whole thing, but there's no denying that it lacks on the intelligence and is once again, a predictable affair. And there's no character development either - didn't either of the Spy Kids learn anything from their encounters in the game? There really isn't much to warrant a DVD purchase - though you can still view it in 3D on the TV, a lot of the experience is lost in the translation.

But none of this matters, because a new company called Legion, ends up doing the same thing in the future anyway. Basically, this movie tells us that an AI Judgment Day is inevitable. Even if they stop Legion in this movie, another company can just take its place in any future sequel."", ""In its core its a rehash of everything we have seen before only worse. As many said before some characters are almost a parody of their former selfs. The writers wanted to mess with the viewers expectations. So they also included a couple of surprises that no one asked for. They even succeeded in gender swapping a key character which happens a lot in movies theses days.

Sarah Connor is old, the bodyguard from the future is an augmented young woman, mankind's only hope is a teeny tiny girl from Mexico, and Arnie's T-800 has developed a conscience and settled down with a family (I kid you not).Don't bother trying to work out how this film fits into the whole Terminator timeline: they pretty much explain away most of the other movies to make it easier on the viewer. All you need to know is that another terminator has been sent from the future to kill Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes), saviour of the human race, and lots of stuff gets shot at, blown up, and smashed into a gazillion pieces in the process. Nasty terminator (Gabriel Luna) is virtually indestructible, which means that there's even more carnage than ever, because in Hollywood's eyes, bigger is always better.Unfortunately, director Tim Miller really doesn't know when to pull hard on the reins, and allows the action to escalate to ridiculous levels. Hence, we have the risible sight of our feisty female trio falling from a burning plane in a Humvee, crashing onto a dam, plummeting over the edge, and being washed along in a flood of water whilst simultaneously being attacked by the rampaging Rev-9 robot. Not since Harrison Ford stumbled out of a lead-lined fridge have I had to suspend my disbelief quite as much.Reasonably enjoyable in a 'switch off your brain and bask in the chaos' kind of way, Dark Fate isn't quite as bad as Genisys (the pared down script at least makes it easy to follow), but even after 28 years and several attempts, they still haven't come close to T2 for sheer entertainment value."", ""The action scenes are the best I've watched, the CGI and deaging of the actors because of the end of the second installment (28 years ago) is amazing.

It is a beautiful work of art (The Director\'s Cut is also a must-see, because the added scenes elaborate on a few confusing plot points) Now, I would just like to take a moment and talk about the aspects of Stargate that make it an enjoyable, exciting, riveting, and thought-provoking film.First of all, David Arnold has to be recognized for his masterful soundtrack. He should have won some kind of award, like Hans Zimmer won for Gladiator. David Arnold combines themes of romance, adventure, and wonder the likes of which I have never heard. (And believe me, I am an avid fan of movie music, especially Sci-Fi) I am even brave enough to say that his music in Stargate rivals classic, celebrated soundtracks such as Star Wars (John Williams) Next time you see the movie, pay as much attention to David Arnold\'s music as you pay to the plot. The opening titles themselves are reason enough to rush to the store immediately and buy the soundtrack. My favorite sequence of the soundtrack, by the way, is (#21 Myth, Faith, and Belief) In the movie, this is the scene where Daniel (James Spader) talks to Ra (Jaye Davidson) It is the scene right before the one where Daniel is *almost* forced to kill the soldiers, including Jack O\'Neill (Kurt Russell) that he arrived with.Second of all, this is a VERY believable science fiction film. Most films (like Star Wars, Star Trek, and more) don\'t have very many ways in which they can actually tie-in with reality. Stargate is in itself a theory. It asks: Where did the pyramids come from? How did the Egyptians develop their gods, and how were they influenced? The answer given by the film to these questions is entirely feasible. Even though the gate itself isn\'t easy to accept, the underlying theme to the movie is. (pay very very close attention to Daniel and the ""seminar"" he gives about 10 minutes into the movie in front of other scientists)Third, and last, I would like to tip the hat to Jaye Davidson\'s performance. His portrayal of Ra is chilling.(although some people don\'t seem to agree) Just hearing him speak and seeing his eyes glow sends shivers up my spine. He makes a perfect villain, and it is truly a shame that he hasn\'t been in many other movies.This movie receives from me an easy 9 out of 10. It would have gotten a 10 if it were not for the horrible lack of character development. Jack O\'Neill is especially bland, although he does seem to brighten up a little bit in the last scene.\nSee the movie! Buy the soundtrack! And I hope you liked my comments!', 'First, I do have to feel sorry for the people who considered Stargate ""typical"" or ""old fashioned"". Makes me wonder what kinds of lives they lead.Stargate didn\'t have a major book to emulate, it is pure imagination...and some darned good imagination at that. Emerich and crew created not only a new world for us, they created a whole new Universe that spawned one of the most successful series ever...it does not get much better than that my friends...The story itself is straight forward scifi, with little bits of background stories woven in to keep the flavor interesting...a few might call it fairly slow moving, and frankly it is, but I think they had to do that to tell the whole story...I liked it just the way it was produced, and became an avid fan of the series that followed...Yup, it is a classic movie, by anyone\'s standards...', 'The movie was initially interesting and well done. Once the violence started, it turned into generic Hollywood mass shooting nonsense. A wasted opportunity, as the premise of the story was good.', ""I loved this movie. It captured my attention quickly and kept it throughout the movie. It's a great ensamble cast and the special effects add to the movie's appeal, rather than BEING the appeal. The premise is engaging, and gives some very plausible explainations for mysteries that have stumped man for thousands of years. The bad guys are just as engagine as the good guys and that makes the movie all that much more enjoyable.I would give this movie an 8 out of 10. It's not perfect, but good for a very enjoyable movie night!"", ""Stargate starts in 1928 in Giza where an archaeological dig uncovers an alien Stargate used to travel between worlds. Jump forward to the 'Present Day' where Egyptologist Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) has radical theories that the Pyramids weren't constructed by the Egyptians, he is contacted by Catherine Langford (Viveca Lindfors) & given the opportunity to prove his theories. Langford takes Jackson to an underground Military facility where no-one has been able to work out how to operate the mysterious Stargate, within a couple of weeks Jackson has it all figured out. A mission is undertaken to travel through the Stargate to a distant planet & investigate the alien world on the other side...This French American co-production was co-written & directed by Roland Emmerich & is a fine sci-fi adventure film that holds up very well even when viewed today nearly fifteen years after it was made which is a feat in itself since a lot of sci-fi dates badly very quickly. Originally the rough cut for Stargate was apparently three hours long, it was eventually released into theatres at two hours long & has subsequently been released in a 'Director's Cut' that adds about ten more minutes to the theatrical cut, having said that I will be basing my comments on the original two hour theatrical version. The script by Emmerich & producer Dean Devlin bases itself on the idea that an alien visited Earth & formed our society & Egypt is a reflection of those aliens, it's a reasonable idea although since the alien planet looks like a desert with Egyptian Pyramids & human beings as it's inhabitants it sometimes feels like Stargate is set on Earth rather than some distant planet on the edge of the known Universe. The story starts off intriguing enough & it's a very watchable & overall enjoyable film but at two hours in length it does drag at times & I wasn't keen on the rebellious slave uprising at the end, it just felt rather clichéd & predictable. The character's are alright & it's refreshing to see an alien planet where the aliens don't speak English, while this maybe authentic you can see why most sci-fi films don't go down this route since lots of alien dialogue without knowing what they are saying does tend to get a bit tedious, I certainly wouldn't want to watch many films where half the dialogue spoken is quite literally alien although having said that towards the end the dialogue starts to be subtitled.Director Emmerich is no stranger to the big budget special effects laden blockbuster & would go on to make films such as Independence Day (1992), Godzilla (1998) & The Day After Tomrrow (2004). Stargate was his second 'big' film after the rather good Jean-Claude Van Damme action sci-fi film Universal Solider (1992), Stargate certainly looks nice enough from the bright sunshine of the desert planet to the dark grey interiors of the evil aliens spaceship. The special effects are generally very good, made before a time CGI computer effects were used for everything Stargate has a mixture of CGI, model work & on set effects which all blend together to make for a convincing alien world. The huge Pyramid spaceship in particular looks very impressive. Apparently conceived by Emmerich during film school in 1979 both he & Devlin were sued by someone who alleged they stole the story from him, the case was settled out of court.With a supposed budget of about $55,000,000 Stargate was a well funded film & it show's with a real sense of scope & scale, it also has that polished Hollywood feel although the scene at the end where Daniel & the girl are transported back down into the Pyramid is very poorly edited & it is actually quite difficult to make out what's happening. Apparently filmed in California & Arizona. The acting is good, I have always liked Kurt Russell but don't consider this to be one of his best films as he gives a largely cold & detached performance & only really becomes the action hero for the last fifteen minutes while Spader is likable enough as the geeky hero.Stargate is a good solid sci-fi film that doesn't quite reach the heights of greatness due to it's length, a lot of pointless dialogue scenes with aliens who you can't understand & I didn't really like the constant bland desert setting that much. Followed by the popular American Canadian TV series Stargate SG-1 (1997 - 2007) which ran for ten seasons & two hundred & thirteen episodes which itself spawned another TV series Stargate: Atlantis (2004) which is still running now & the less than popular Stargate: Infinity (2002) which ran for a single solitary season."", ""I had never seen Stargate before 2020 the TV show or this movie but as a bit of a science fiction nerd I thought it was time I gave it a watch and I honestly wasn't disappointed with it the movie is quite unique and has a storyline that kept my interest and was pretty original for it's time.Stargate takes place in 1994 when linguist and Egyptian professor Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is payed a visit by an archaeologist who in 1928 when she was just a young girl was there when an ancient Egyptian artifact thought to be a device of some kind and stone tablets inscribed with an ancient Egyptian language were discovered during a dig by the Egyptian pyramids she invites him to study the artifact in a top secret base in the hopes he is able to decipher the inscriptions and find out how to use the device he successfully powers the device up which they find out is actually a portal to another point in space a planet similar to earth across a distant galaxy so he and Army Col. Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) along with some soldiers cross the portal to discover what lies on the other side there they find a primitive civilization who speak a long dead Egyptian language and worship the sun god RA who created the Stargate between the two planets and established a mining colony between both worlds using humans as slaves on both worlds until an uprising on earth dethroned him and branded him a false god tearing down the Stargate between the two worlds Jackson soon discovers RA is actually an alien who traveled across space to find a way to cheat death RA discovered earth and humankind and using a human body as a host he can live forever as the god RA by regenerating the host body so he never age's and dies but Jackson and O'Neil reveal to the slaves that there god is flesh and blood and they can overthrow him starting a rebellion against him that ends in his ultimate defeat Jackson stays behind with the humans on the strange planet with his love interest to create a new civilisation free of slavery while O'Neil and the remaining soldiers travel back to earth via the Stargate and destroy it on there side to protect earth from any possible other Stargates out there.The story is well written and the movie takes it's time building up the anticipation of what's on the other side of the Stargate then takes it time exploring the other side and it's environment rather than just doing what most science fiction movie's do and rush into the action it's a nice change of pace then when the movie's action scenes do start up it feels well placed and part of the story not just shoved in to spice the movie up a bit.I recommend this movie to any science fiction movie fan it's the story and visuals that are the main theme in this movie a lot like Star Trek it focuses on the intellectual side of science fiction and not just the action very enjoyable to watch if your a science fiction nerd like myself.Just a side note I purchased the Directors Cut Special Edition on Blu Ray released in 2008 and it has no language options or subtitle options not a huge deal for most but is an issue if you suffer from deafness or are hard of hearing."", ""Stargate is one of those great movies that hasn't got the respect it deserves. At first I thought the movie was about time travel since they go to a place that is like Ancient Egypt, which didn't really interest me at all. Then I caught an episode of the T.V. show and got curious. When I saw the movie I was blown away. The special effects were ones I had never really seen before (such as opening the Stargate for the first time). I was getting tired of seeing sci-fi movies where every alien race spoke perfect English and I thought I would experience that until the team met with the villagers which I thought was better. It's always cool to see Kurt Russel kicking ass in films. It was also different to see James Spader play the semi-nerdy guy instead of the asshole he mainly plays. I was also amazed when Roland Emmerich chose one of the simplest villains for a movie, an ancient Egyptian god. I watch this movie every week and I never get tired of it."", ""The first twenty minutes of this movie were extremely promising. Then the whole thing fell apart and seemed like a 'prequel' to 'Independence Day'. I would like to thank our Swedish contributor. I don't speak Swedish and thought that the language used was another 'made up' language that is used in 'alien' films. It's most annoying that these languages are always spoken in sharp, short bursts which have no flow. Why Swedish? If one is going to use an alien language, just make it up or find a language which is less-known. Viveca Lindfors was sadly wasted as were the other actors in the beginning of the film. They just disappeared. I would have much rather seen a movie about Lindfors life from the first discovery of the Stargate. I wonder if she was the Swedish coach? The premise was interesting but the behavior on the 'parallel' world was ridiculous. The cliches flew quick and fast. James Spaders falls in love with dusky native maiden. How many times has this 'instant cross cultural love' been used? What is really offensive about this plot device is that 99% of the time, it's always a white MALE who gets the 'native'.The other cliches were just as bad. When a problem can't be solved, the Americans 'get out the guns'. Guns solve everything. (I am an American.) Jaye Davidson was very good in 'The Crying Game', but his character in 'Stargate' was as weak as the plot and gave no sense of the immense power he was supposed to wield. James Spader was, in my opinion, playing the 'cliche' genius, with a lot of little 'absent-minded' mannerisms which were supposed to make him 'cute'. I didn't mind his hair. Kurt Russell was another cliche. The way to bring him back from a deep and suicidal depression was to send him out on a mission.Then he gets to kill a lot of people, which makes him feel much better. Something that the army would never risk.   In the process,he finds a surrogate son in the Bedouin boy.  Give us a break!""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This film might have benefited from a shorter run time. The biggest surprise was Laureline(Delevingne), her character is what kept my interest throughout the film and her acting was actually on point.

Their Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) sends them back to high school to go undercover as students to crack a drug ring.This is an re-imagining of the 80s TV show. Unlike many others who try to remake 80s show, this one is actually funny, and joyous. They have great chemistry, and are hilarious together. Surprisingly, Channing Tatum does have some comedic chops. His timing is quite good. Jonah Hill is a great partner. Ice Cube does an intimidating Captain without losing likability. In fact, I think everybody is having a good fun time, and I think it shows.', 'Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum rule in this politically incorrect comedy that had me laughing out loud. Jonah Hill shouting at a suspect running away, ""I\'m going to shoot you if you don\'t slow down."" They go undercover to find the drug dealers at a high school. Having been out of high school for 7 years they find it hard to adopt to 2012. Ice Cube was great as the stereotypical angry black police captain who tells people to embrace their stereotypes. Jake M. Johnson is the principle. His first words are ""I am just one more gay black kid being punched in the face from a nervous break down."" The drama teacher tells his students, ""I remember being in upstate New York doing cocaine with Willie Nelson\'s horse...""The great one liners are seemingly endless. Jonah Hill tries out for the role of Peter Pan while Channing\'s chemistry teacher comes on to him. The guys forgot who they were and end up with each other identities. Jonah Hill is in drama and a ""track star"" while meat head Tatum is in the AP classes. The cops are bumbling in their roles but manage to get the job done. There are some social issues mentioned in the movie in a comedic fashion. One is the difference on how people view a black kid who dies from drugs as from a white kid. Another is the commercialization of education. Highly recommended comedy.Frequent F-bombs, sexual humor, no nudity', ""21 Jumpstreet is rehashed as a comedy and it worked!? Go figure. There are not many remakes that are good in any respect, so for 21 Jumpstreet to be done again and done as a comedy no less was a real win.This movie had excellent writers. Jonah Hill is a funny guy anyway so I expected a reasonable performance from him but there were good performances all around. I think the movie did well to poke fun at itself along the way, it provided some genuinely funny moments.The movie did fall into predictability towards the end. More accurately, the movie fell into a cliché ending. It seemed that the writers may have run out of steam. Even with that, the movie was funny enough and Ice Cube didn't wreck it with his terrible acting."", ""This movie seems to be confused as to whether it was supposed to be an action movie or a comedy and fails to achieve either. It isn't really very funny at all and it drags too much to be exciting. It has other problems as well. The jokes try to hard to be hip and end up being just plays on stereotypes. For example, in a misguided attempt to look cool one of the characters punches a guy for being nerdy. The victim mistakenly believes he was punched because he is black and gay which makes the cop look uncool. In another example, throughout the movie the head of the jump street program acts like a stereotypical bad tempered black cop, even calling himself that. It is vaguely amusing the first time, but the next umpteen times it gets a little lame as do the frequent jokes about the guys not looking like teenagers. The visual and verbal humor are like this through the whole movie. The movie portrays alcohol and drug use as a funny joke. It shows scenes of the cops high on the supposedly deadly drug they are supposed to be in high school stopping. It shows them buying booze for an underage party and it's supposed to be funny because they have to use false IDs. It shows them stealing marijuana from the evidence lockup to share with the kids. I know it's a comedy not a message movie, but this is just not funny. To top it off, they don't even get reprimanded for any of the illegal things they do from giving drugs to minor to engaging in a high speed chase on a freeway, to reckless discharge of firearms, to taking further police actions when technically fired. The action is boring. The interminably long scenes of bicycle, car, and limousine chases do not even begin to liven up this bomb. They are not interesting. The juvenile behavior the two leads exhibit ruins any dramatic elements of the movie. They don't act like two adults pretending to be kids, they act more like two kids pretending to be cops. I used to watch the 21 Jump Street series and it was a serious drama about serious issues like homosexual bullying, drugs, suicide, and peer pressure. It may have been a little soap operish at times, but it was dramatic and interesting. I think it deserved more respect than this."", 'At first, I didn\'t want to watch this movie. Not that I\'m loyal to the original or anything. I wasn\'t a huge fan of the 1987\'s show \'21 Jump Street\' nor did the trailers do any favors. The trailer look awful, and it seemed like an entirely pointless remake. I did however watch this movie when my friends told me that I should give it a try. I guess the movie had a lot of Street Cred. Surprising this movie was pretty good, and pretty damn funny. The movie starts out with not the original cast or even the same characters of the show, but two new characters in their high school days. While, it\'s only for a very brief time on film, just long enough to establish Schmidt (Jonah Hill) as an insecure nerd and Jenko (Channing Tatum) as a dumb jock. It then cuts to present day, where both are working as undercover cops on Jump Street. The new cops are tasked with finding the supplier of a new recreational drug called ""HFS"". For them, to find him, they must go undercover at the local high school, and forced to relive their old high school days. They soon find out that surprising, the high school life has change since their outing. The movie comedy is mostly hits for me, as I love how they make fun of high school comedy and buddy-cop clichés. There are a lot of unexpected and hilarious lines delivered totally straight forward. The movie does have quite a few moments of parody that were pretty funny. This is just one of those high school movie clichés that the movie had to hit. The high school over the top party. The twist here is that the party is being put on by a couple of totally irresponsible and stupid adults, who not only have access to alcohol but an entire evidence locker full of illegal drugs. I find this part of the movie, a bit of contradiction. Schmidt and Jenko try to arrest a bunch of bikers in the beginning of the movie, for smoking marijuana. Then later on the film, they steals marijuana to be used at the party. How is it, OK for them to smoke \'Mary Jane\' and not the bikers? Also, the movie glorified their irresponsible for serving alcohol to minors is just wrong. Also how the movie makes it seem that if you want to have a good time, take drugs and drink alcohol. Don\'t add glamor to that kind of stuff for minors. That\'s why we have stupid shows like 16 & Pregnant. Don\'t ask how they even became cops in the first place, and how they never get punished for any of the mistakes they do throughout the film like forgetting the Miranda rights, stealing cars, and weapon discharge. Not one disciplinary action for anything they do. Also how is Jonah Hill\'s character Schmidt allow to hit on Molly (Brie Larson) when she could be underage? The movie never establish what her age is, but if she is 17, that\'s still a criminal act of having relationship with a minor. They make several gags in the movie about how Jenko and Schmidt look old, yet the actors portraying the high schoolers don\'t look like they belong there, too. The only ones, I did believe were in high school was the so called geeks. The acting is pretty good from all the cast. Yes, there are a few cameos of the Original cast of \'21 Jump Street\' playing themselves. While the TV show was taking as a serious crime drama, the movie makes it seem like a joke, even beloved characters are made out to be silly. If you are a fan of the 1987\'s show, you might find this movie making fun of you, and making you feel stupid for liking the original show. I don\'t get the film, is it trying to pay tribute to the show or parody it? The movie has false advertising written all over. For the regular fans of the show, do warning, this movie isn\'t like the show. Anyways their cameo is very short so if you\'re not paying attention, you might miss it. By the way, check all the shots on the TV in the film. Look at the scene where they are getting a car, and last the scene where the drug deal go wrong. You will find them there. The music choices for film are pretty good, but I can do without that damn Kesha\'s song in the end. Overall, the movie is pretty entertaining to me. So go see it.', ""On the surface, this movie looks like it would be somewhat mediocre. But it's actually pretty damn good. When you're not laughing your pants off (and believe me, you will be), you'll have no problem being just plain entertained by it's ability to just have fun. It does a great job of not only avoiding giant cliché's, but making fun of them in the process. Jonah Hill will have you laughing, and Channing Tatum actually did a good job in this movie.......not surprising seeing that the role called for him to be a douche bag. Which once again, is something to chuckle about. Towards the end, the movie does tend to drag on, but has no problem pulling you right back into it's fun. As far as comedies go, this is a pretty good way to start off 2012"", ""In high school, Schmidt was a dork and Jenko was the popular jock.After graduation, both of them joined the police force and ended up as partners riding bicycles in the city park.Since they are young and look like high school students, they are assigned to an undercover unit to infiltrate a drug ring that is supplying high school students synthetic drugs....Yes it's the movie version of that TV show that hardly anyone remembers in England but made Depp a star.This goes down the Starsky and Hutch route, and goes funny all the way. It works on many levels, and instead of this being a gross out comedy, which it could have clearly gone down, it goes for subtle laughs and action, and relies on the cast chemistry to make it work.It's Tatums best performance, he shines in this movie and outdoes anyone on the screen. He is easily the funniest thing, which is odd, because Hill is usually very good (here he is slightly annoying).The story is predictable, as is the special cameo, and this sometimes hinders the flow of the film, but although the plot and narrative can be convoluted, the spin on changing the two leads status at school is a great inclusion to the film, as is the set piece which involves the two expecting things to explode, which sounds silly, but is funny.So all in all, it's a film that shouldn't be funny, but it is, thanks to some great performances and a fresh feel to it all around.Well worth seeing."", ""I really expected to hate this! I was a big fan of the original show and did not want to see this made. But today for some strange reason I found myself watching it ... and I loved it! Very different from the original series which I think was a good move! It really didn't even need to be called 21 Jump street, it could have stood on it's own but kinda glad they did so I could see all those cameos from the originals :) That was fun! I really don't have anything bad to say about this movie, it was written well, the actors were good and it was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time! I gave it a 10 star and it's rare that I do that!"", ""This movie... I went into it thinking it would be like every other buddy cop movie I've ever see. And it was. But that's the beauty of it. It fully leans into the fact that comedy buddy cop movies have become something of a trope. It IS tropey and somehow subverts those tropes at the same time. It's profane and violent but I had a GREAT time watching it. Sometimes, all you need is a little slapstick comedy and an in-your-face, half-assed message.Delightful. I, for one, loved it and all the characters in a dear-god-what're-you-doing sorta way."", ""Sure, this is based on the 1987-91 television series of the same name by Stephen J. Cannell and Patrick Hasburgh, but I was amazed by how much I loved this movie. It takes that concept, goes crazy and pushes every teen movie cliche as far as it can take it.In 2005, Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) are denied access to their prom, with Schmidt rejected and Jenko's grades keeping him away. Years later, they meet again at police academy and somehow become best friends and eventually bike patrol partners. Their first arrest, a drug bust, goes bad when Greg forgets the Miranda rights.The team is reassigned to the Jump Street team, which infiltrates high schools with undercover agents under the command of Captain Dickson (Ice Cube).There's a drug at Sagan High School called HFS that has been killing students, so Morton and Greg get new identities and learn that society has changed. Everything that made Greg popular is now frowned upon, so his only friends are the geeks. Morton is now popular and fast friends with Eric (Dave Franco), who is creating the drugs.Can the guys catch the criminals? Will Morton fall in love with Eric's girlfriend Molly (Brie Larson)? Will they throw a massive drug fueled party? Of course. But getting there is so much fun, as this is a movie that doesn't take itself or its subject matter seriously.There are some great supporting actors here, from Rob Riggle as a gym teacher to Chris Parnell as a drama teacher, Ellie Kemper as a science teacher, Dakota Johnson as a fellow Jump Street team member and Nick Offerman as the Deputy Chief. If you loved the original show, good news. All of the original cast, except Richard Grieco and Dustin Nguyen, appear in cameo roles."", ""Despite all the hype, I'm sad to report that 21 Jump Street, the new action comedy based on the 1987 TV series, just isn't very funny. My problem with it, is that Jonah Hill's 'Morton Schmidt' and Channing Tatum's 'Greg Jenko' are so over the top as cops, that you cannot take most of it very seriously at all.For example, when Jenko can't remember his Miranda warnings, or even worse, when Jenko fires his gun in the park, after tackling a bad guy, these type of things would probably lead to immediate dismissal from the force in real life. And what about, after being expressly prohibited from serving alcohol to minors, the bumbling duo go ahead and serve up drinks at the 'undercover' party, anyway?";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The studios took a big chance and allowed a young Tim Burton to take on their biggest asset and he made a movie like no other directer could. Along with Christopher Reeve as Superman, Michael Keaton will always be my top choice for the role as he plays the haunted and lost Bruce Wayne so fantastically well that I doubt it will ever be bettered. Jack Nicholson was born to play the joker, the score is epic, the set design is wonderful. And although not everything runs smoothly, as far as I'm concerned this will always be the superhero movie to beat."", ""In 1989, Tim Burton created the very first Batman movie with great stars like Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. The Joker is definitely one of Hollywood's best villains on screen. Jack Nicholson was born for the role, with his psychotic and sick look. Michael Keaton is also great as Batman and is pretty good as Bruce Wayne. Kim Basinger is kind of annoying at times, but she's not the worst damsel in distress ever seen on screen.Tim Burton has a unique way of doing Batman, and I think most people can agree that it fits the characters and the story. To bad Warner Bros. got rid of him after the 2nd film."", ""Rating6/10Time hasn't been too kind to this Batman entry despite it being a huge box office success. Nolan's films put it in the shade. Yet there are pleasures to be found if one isn't too picky. Jack is obviously enjoying himself and it shows! Keaton does a good job although the film doesn't give him enough importance as the focus is wholly on the villain. The fights and special effects are dated.Watchable."", 'While The Dark Knight set box office records and drew more critical acclaim and discussion than perhaps any other super-hero movie ever, it shouldn\'t obscure the fact that the second Batman movie was pretty darn good in its own right. And yes, it\'s the second Batman movie. The Adam West one counts.Blooming out of the mind of oddball director Tim Burton, this Batman movie was one of the first films to introduce the general public to the darker and more psychologically complex world of comic book super-heroes that had replaced the wholesome, square-jawed, morally correct characters of the 1940s and 50s. That a DC character like Batman is the one who exposed America to the changes actually brought to the super-hero genre by Stan Lee and company at Marvel is one of those quirks of history. This Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) is an odd fellow, disconnected from other people and real life, with genuine pain lingering just under his skin.Keaton\'s Wayne and Batman are probably the most interesting version of the character to ever appear in a movie, which makes it especially strange and regrettable that this film really isn\'t about him. First and foremost, it\'s about the Joker (Jack Nicholson). His transformation from slightly disturbed mob enforcer to larger than life, mass murdering super-villain is at the heart of the story. Everyone else is really part of an ensemble supporting Nicholson, with Bruce Wayne not being that much bigger a part than Knox (Robert Wuhl), the muckraking reporter out to break the story of Batman, or Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger), the photojournalist who comes to Gotham because she read Knox\'s stories and likes bats. In fact, Knox and Vale are really more important characters to the story than Wayne or Batman for the first half of the film. It\'s not until the second half of the movie that the title character plays a major role in what\'s going on.It\'s to Burton\'s credit and the actors\' that the story doesn\'t really suffer because of its contrary focus. As you rewatch it, it makes less and less sense that Batman is largely about everyone except Batman. It\'s hard to understand why they thought the Knox character was necessary, for example. But Nicholson carries the movie on his back, Basinger brings more than you\'d expect to the girlfriend/damsel in distress role and Keaton\'s performance is so quietly suggestive and intriguing that you don\'t realize how little he\'s actually in the film.Visually, the movie is as interesting as Burton\'s other films. Gotham City is a crowded, dirty, urban hell, like a 17th century city that grew and metastasized without any planning or zoning considerations. The Batmobile in this film supplanted the look of the 1960s version, becoming the standard template for how the vehicle would look for over 20 years. The Batsuit in this movie is probably the best looking version of the costume ever on film, certainly more aesthetically pleasing than the battlesuit Batman of the two most recent movies, though it did give us the thick, rubber Bat-helmet look that has burdened the character ever since. Burton doesn\'t really know how to shoot a great action sequence, but at least he keeps the camera steady so you can see what\'s going on. And there are a few times when Burton seems to miss the point of a scene and shoot it in a confusing manner.In the wake of all the praise given to Heath Ledger\'s performance in The Dark Knight, you might think that Nicholson\'s Joker would pale in comparison\x85but it doesn\'t. Ledger\'s Joker is a much deeper character who is less a real person and more a living embodiment of anarchy. Nicholson\'s Joker is much more grounded. He\'s an evil person, but he\'s very much a person. He has understandable goals and motivations. He\'s just someone who\'s inhibitions and impulse control have been stripped away. Some might say Ledger\'s Joker is more realistic but it\'s Nicholson who creates a more fully formed character.It is the question of realism that most divides this film from the more recent movie incarnations of Batman (and this film\'s immediate sequels as well). This movie is very much a work of fantasy where the filmmakers and actors don\'t expect it to conform to the rules and needs of the real world and don\'t expect the audience to want that either. It has an internal logic and sense of its own reality, but there\'s virtually no effort made to explain or justify how this stuff could happen in the real world. I would bet that future generations will look back and wonder at why people would feel the need to portray a character as outlandish as Batman in a realistic way and wonder at how much effort was made in The Dark Knight and Batman Begins to pretend that ""Yeah, this could really happen"" when it really couldn\'t.Batman is certainly more spectacle than substance. But when you\'re telling a story about a guy who puts on a cape and pointy-eared mask to beat the crap out of a murderer who looks like a clown\x85how much substance should you really want out of it?', 'After watching this movie again recently, I have realized what a terrible joke this film is compared to the newest Batman film, ""Batman Begins"". The way people talk about this film on here, you would think that Tim Burton is some kind of legend, but that\'s hardly the case. If you honestly thought that this film is true in spirit to the comic book series, you are most decidedly wrong, but there are other problems at work here.First of all, watching this film will make you realize just how little focus is actually spent on the title character. Bruce Wayne\'s back-story is almost completely glossed over, and as a result, it doesn\'t feel like Bruce is trying to save the city he grew up in. Rather, the film makes him look like a complete psycho (especially evident in the ""You wanna get nuts?"" scene) who picks on petty thieves. Batman is supposed to be a detective, but it sure doesn\'t feel like he does much detective work here. Instead, he just waits until someone alerts him to a problem, then he shows up and saves the day.As I said in the title of this review, the film should have been titled ""Joker"", if only for the reason that, for most of the film, we follow Jack Nicholson around as he exploits to kill all the residents of Gotham. Not that Jack Nicholson is a bad actor, mind you, because he does what he to jazz up the role. However, I already understood his purpose within the first few minutes of seeing him, and I didn\'t really require seeing him sitting in his hideout cutting out pictures of Vicki Vale.Batman does not kill. EVER. He has a sense of morals, and a sense of justice. He doesn\'t just run around beating up and killing guys, especially to the point of blowing up an entire chemical factory with criminals inside. It may look cool on the big screen, but it\'s not who he is.I also found it surprising how stupid some of the characters are. For example, it seems that Bruce has no problem driving a woman to the Batcave, bringing her in, showing her around the place, THEN SEDUCING HER. Better yet, I also wondered how foolish the people in Gotham were when they were blindly grabbing money from the Joker\'s henchmen, in light of the recent event where he poisoned a woman on television who was using one of his products.I found Michael Keaton\'s performance...underwhelming, I guess would be the right word. He plays Bruce Wayne like a jittering, nervous wreck, the type of guy who probably spent his high school years cramming for exams in the basement. Even when he\'s in the Batsuit, he looks small and unassuming. As for the rest of the cast, they do commendable jobs, especially with Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Gough as Alfred.If anyone hasn\'t this yet, and is wondering if the film is faithful to the comic books, prepare to be disappointed: this is nothing like the comics. There are several differences between the film and the comics, some of which work, and some of which don\'t. I guess having the Joker being the one who killed Bruce\'s parents may have worked on screen, but it sounds absolutely ridiculous once you realize that Bruce actually remembered who killed his parents all his life, and waits until the END of the film to tell Joker about this fact.What this film doesn\'t do is show how the general population reacts to Batman\'s exploits. Like one poster stated, the people living in Metropolis in ""Superman: The Movie"" and the people living in Gotham City in ""Batman Begins"" both react to what is happening around them. People actually care what is happening to the person that is saving them. Here in this film, we have no clue if anyone knows what\'s going on, or for that matter, if anyone even cares about what Batman does, aside from the city paper (and even they believe he\'s not real) and Commissioner Gordon.The action scenes in this film are also short and unsatisfying. It feels like Batman can just single-handedly beat up anyone, which is hard to believe, especially given the fact that we know from dialogue spoken in the film that Bruce hasn\'t been out doing his Batman thing for very long. Even the climactic battle with the Batwing is rushed and pointless. We never get to see the full capabilities of what Batman can do here.Bottom Line: I am giving this film a 4 out of 10, largely because of the strength of the supporting cast. This film really hasn\'t aged well. I would recommend that you watch either Batman Returns or Batman Begins.', ""Firstly may I just state that 'Batman' is one of those films where Batman isn't really the star. The star character is in fact the Joker played to brilliance by Jack Nicholson. However seeing as Batman himself didn't have that much of a back-story back then, its no wonder. All the character had for a well enough established origin was 'parents were murdered in a back alley' (the graphic novel 'Year One' only hit shelves like one year before the films release). So its no wonder why the Joker almost steals the entire film. Having said that Michael Keaton does make an excellent Bruce Wayne/Batman depicting a man constantly in turmoil between identities. The plot line initially seems rather basic good vs evil. However after watching it time and time again it actually gets more intriguing. Particularly with how Joker rises to the top of Gotham's criminal empire to further his plot. If you want a Batman story thats still dark but more grittier then watch Nolan's interpretations. They're every bit as enjoyable as this and vice versa. But if you want to watch a Batman that's grim in a graphic novel way this is it."", 'Spoiler Review\nThe movie of its time was great but Little bit un comic type Compare to the 1966 one .. Probably because its inspired By Another Batman Comic Probably? OK So first the story..Honestly it\'s good I mean I don\'t have anything thing To say IMO But there is some Villains Background We Didn\'t Get that much of Backstory That\'s disappointing.... The acting must look Goofy and silly but Remember this Movie was Made in 1980s Time so Can\'t Say anything about That time of culture..The Villains are good but joker is More Ugly on here..in the 1966 he looks Very much Like the comic one but this one isn\'t Look anything like it also How can a chemical Can change his Body To white Fully XD..Makes no sense...The Dialogues are Awesome no question my Favourite one is when joker Shoot Batman and Batman Who Wasn\'t killed(cause he was having Bulletproof in his clothes)..Joker said ""did you ever dance with the devil in a pale moonlight""..Damn and that Twist that he was the killer was something Great..It must not be comic accurate but it is a great gritty movie ..7/10 in my opinion.', 'Batman is very much a product of its time. It has ""made in the 80s"" written all over it, with Keaton\'s big mullet, the music and acting styles. My main issue is the complete lack of explanation for anything. I don\'t see the appeal of hero/superhero films with no back story. Close to the end we find out Wayne\'s parents were murdered and that\'s why he\'s a bit screwed up, but that\'s the entire story we get to work with. Why is he dressed as a bat? Why did he become a vigilante? Who makes those toys and vehicles? And Michael Keaton just cannot pull off the role. He is passable as Bruce Wayne, nothing special but he\'ll do. But as soon as he puts on the suit he suddenly starts walking like some sort of robot. The concepts of style, finesse, flair and cool seem to have completely passed him by. He\'s just not convincing as a tough hero guy, he looks so awkward in doing anything at all.It just seems to try and be \'cool\' for the sake of it. The new Batmobile thing is a military tank spray-painted black with an afterburner to jump gaps. It was designed for a purpose and has a practical use. The Batmobile here, however, looks like some sort of space shuttle with an afterburner that doesn\'t appear to go particularly fast. It just looks ridiculous. Where did he get it? Does the manufacturer not have suspicions about Batman\'s identity when he realises he not so long ago was asked to build a rocket car with a bat wing on the roof? As for the Batwing thing, there are no words to describe how terrible that is. It just appears from nowhere, with no explanation, and doesn\'t look like it could physically get off the ground in that shape. The brief scene where the Batwing popped up above the clouds and lined up with the moon to make the symbol made me want to bang my head on something.And as a side note, why does Batman only appear to be able to glide at a perfectly vertical angle? The opening scene where he lowers onto the rooftops where the guys are counting the money, and then spreads his wings when they turn around and again after he gets shot, is just cringeworthy.Thank god for Nicholson then, the saving grace. His exceptionally manic performance as the Joker is superb, genuinely believable, despite it\'s ludicrous extremism. Michael Gough and Robert Wuhl also put in fairly decent performances that stand out above the rest.Whilst the direction is good for the most part, and I admire the extremely Gothic art direction Burton has gone for, I can\'t help but feel Gotham is a bit unconvincing. I know it\'s a big city, as well as an island, but during those far out landscape shots everything seems so over the top and the city so isolated that it feels less like a sprawling metropolis and more like an over-sized Disneyland with no source of light.And all this is a great shame, because it could have been very good. Had they at least attempted to put in an explanation to anything, got another actor who actually knew how to walk like a human when in the suit and got rid of that spaceship thing then it would probably get another 3 or 4 stars on this review. Perhaps if they had renamed it The Joker (featuring Batman) then it wouldn\'t have been so bitterly disappointing.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

More action + gore, more swearing and cursing. Apart from that, the storyline is similar.Banderas plays a good character in this. Haven\'t yet seen him act poorly. The young girls acting in this movie starts off really poorly, but gradually becomes better throughout.A watchable movie non the less, entertaining.', 'There is nothing sophisticated or clever in this film. All very banal, and of course full of unrealistic sequence of events.Nevertheless, Banderas plays quite well, and the film is generally enjoyable.Best watching this in the background of doing something else, or while relaxing from a long day of work.', ""One of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I don't say that lightly. The premise is thus: the bad guys want to kill a witness for a drug gang, so they wipe out a team of escorting US Marshals and she legs it to a mall.Then Banderas and his heroic band of geeks pick them off one by one til at last the cavalry arrive.It is not remotely in the same league as Die Hard or anything else. It is an appallingly stupid, moronic film which would insult the intelligence of the average cocker spaniel. Granted, Banderas was never a Hollywood A-lister, but it must kill him deep inside to participate in such rubbish given some of the decent movies he has made in his native Spain. Save yourself, it's already too late for me."", 'Die Hard in a Shopping Mall (with a dash of Home Alone). It might not break any new ground, but it treads the old with a firm step, and Banderas has proven himself capable of devoting admirable energy to projects that might not deserve it on paper. Ben Kingsley appears to be trying for a soft Welsh accent with mixed results.', ""This movie might be considered a B-movie because of the budget and released straight to DVD, but honestly, it's a really good movie. Antonio Banderas is underrated, and should really be given the chance to go back to mainstream, especially action films.The movie isn't perfect, and characters could've been fleshed out more but other than that, this is a nice movie to watch on a lazy afternoon on your day off.The action sequences are great. Ben Kingsley, another underrated actor, was also great.It's a well-done action movie with a simple story. If you want to be entertained for an hour and 45mins, this is not a bad choice."", 'No F bombs, drug scenes, or blaring rap music and a pretty good story. There are more casualties on both sides which probably killed the potential BO. But besides very little plausibility, it was exciting throughout, Antonio Banderas has too much of an accent and was a bit hard to understand, so this killed his action hero future. The acting was good and Ben Kingsley did his usual bad guy role with aplomb. My major problem was the entire movie is filmed fairly dark. It is all at night and the mall scenes are mostly without full lighting. Kind of gets claustrophobic after awhile.', 'This production by Millennium Films (the Cannon Films of the 21st century) initially has some interest because it\'s clearly heavily influenced by two movies. The first and most obvious is ""Die Hard"", but it is clear the filmmakers got some inspiration from the John Carpenter movie ""Assault on Precinct 13"". But while this combination gives the movie an initially interesting start, it soon becomes clear that the filmmakers had little else to jazz up this tired movie. It takes forever for it to get going, and once it does, the energy level is surprisingly flat for the most part. Even the final confrontation is a letdown.

The character development is perfect (except Black Widow) and it's as good as a superhero movie can get nowadays.A+"", 'This movie has a fantastic plot and brings all these characters perfectly on screen. The conflict between Steve and Tony is written so well. Zemo is also a good side villain in this movie. The action scenes were well-made.', 'I don\'t understand the hate for this movie it actually surprised me, I really enjoyed this film. Captain America: Civil War is a descent awesome MCU super action the third film of the Captain America trilogy. To me the second movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still the best one I just love that movie to death, but I like this one I love the first one but I just love all three of Captain America films. I thought the cast did a good job Chris Evens kicks ass once again he is Captain America and I look this movie from his point of view. He is really become my favorite hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Avengers films especially Age of Ultron, Captain America is still a guy who has a lot of screen time that it is the focus of a movie and he is still the guy I can take a side I agree with him, I can understand his choices.We have also almost everyone from Avengers films except Thor and Hulk actors Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo did not appear. Chris Hemsworth thought that MCU fired him because he was not cast as Thor but he was later explained that MCU wants his own movie and his own stand alone path which I can\'t wait for Thor: Ragnarok.The cast beside Chris Evens includes Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl.In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions-one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. We have two opposite teams now fighting each other:Team Iron Man: War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, The Vision, Spider-Man.Team Captain America: Hawkeye, Sharon Carter, Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch.The battle between Captain America and Iron Man draws a political line in the sand. On one side, you have Tony Stark, a man looking to protect the world from super-powered individuals who\'ve proved in the past to be more destructive than helpful. On the other, you have Steve Rogers championing civil liberties. It\'s the age old debate of safety coming at the cost of freedom, and we\'ll get to see it play out to a hopefully satisfying conclusion this year.The action scenes are fantastic, the fight scenes on the airport are incredible heart pulse breath taking awesome. The fight scenes were very well done and well choreographed. I liked this movie more the story drew me in, the villain wasn\'t that good.Robert Downey Jr. Does a good job, Paul Rudd he is fun in the flick, he has a great moment as Ant-Man he has a few moments but one predictable. Scarlett Johansson did great! Black Widow kicked ass specially in the beginning of the flick. Anthony Mackie I really like him as Falcon he as a lot of good stuff in this. He was down played in Age of Ultron but has a lot screen time in here which was excellent and they made that for that in this one I am glad for it. Anthony Mackie has a lot of good screen time, specially in the action moments. Falcon has a remote control like a mini Flacon I thought that was really cool. Chris Evens is to root for this character, Black Panther interesting the actor playing black panther was really good I like him and I am really interested seeing his up coming movie. Bucky Barnes: Winter Soldier did fine.A lot of people are complain about how terrible this movie is I am sorry I don\'t see it that way, I don\'t see at all it is peace of sh**. I wish that Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow / Crossbones wouldn\'t die and it was nice to see him in the beginning of the movie. I still wish he would work for the villain I still enjoy his screen time.I thought Chris Evens and Robert Downey Jr, did work great as a opposite team. I love the end of fighting between Cap, Iron Man and Bucky Barnes. I thought the last fight scene was well choreographed I honestly think Iron Man would have won and he would killed Bucky Barnes. If Cap wouldn\'t have hurt his heart. I know when Tony find out Bucky killed his parents and he killed his mom in 1991 he decide to kill him. I mourn with Tony and it was a great dialogue ""That shield doesn\'t belong to you. You don\'t deserve it! My father made that shield!""Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.I understand the hate, because Captain turn the law politics back to save his friend, but he actually try to safe an innocent man who was framed by Zemo.Captain America Civil War WAS BETTER THAN X-MEN APOCALYPSE, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Man of Steel and Deadpool I don\'t like those movies they are peace of sh** and too way overrated. The rating I am giving is 10/10.', ""Captain America: Civil War was a great sequel to Winter Solider. It does take some minimum inspirations from the comics. The elements and plot devices and had outstanding cinematography. A great addition to the MCU.Solid story with some minor flaws. The writing was good and the acting was great. The characters are well written. We are introduced to two new characters such as Black Panther and Spider-Man, even in their minimum screentime they were amazing. It takes time and depth to understand Tony's decisons, during the final moments of the final battle he was consumed by vengeance and his emotions and not guided by his intellect. And lastly with fantastic CGI and music.Overall an enjoyable film.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Unlikely."", 'I am proud to have a fellow Romanian in the States that represents us, our language and values. I am also super happy that I had seen Chadwick Boseman in this movie, because he was a very good actor. I feel shocked that he died so young.', 'A movie can do everything else right, but if the story requires the characters to do something that they would never do, ignores a huge elephant in the room that no one would ignore, etc., then it suddenly becomes garbage because it forces me out of the experience of going along for the ride.This movie could have been good. I love superheroes, especially when movies work in lesser known heroes. There\'s some witty dialogue and plenty of star power and special effects. However, the plot has an absurd contrivance that I cannot get past.In order to plot Captain America versus Iron Man, the authors could not come up with an intelligent misunderstanding. Instead, Captain America\'s friend is framed for a crime and Iron Man thinks he\'s guilty, even when event after event makes this highly dubious, and even when his ""friend"" Captain America tells him he thinks his friend may be innocent. Sorry, based on the track record of this relationship in the movies, Iron Man would HAVE to step back and think twice about this friend\'s guilt if Captain America really asked him to.Moreover, when towards the end Iron Man learns the friend was framed, but learns this friend also had been previously brainwashed to kill in the past, and had killed his parents, he then tries quite un- heroically to kill Cap\'s now un-brainwashed (and framed) friend.What part of brainwashing and mind-control does Iron Man not understand? If some one kills while under the influence of brainwashing and mind-control, they are the VICTIM, and you do NOT try to kill them after they manage to escape and overcome the brainwashing and mind-control.The writers somehow thought they could just sweep this under the intellectual rug by just moving the action along very quickly, as if this would not give the audience time to connect the dots and see how ridiculous and unrealistic this ""dilemma"" really was. Sorry, there was no true dilemma. Captain America was right and Iron Man was wrong, completely, and in a ridiculously contrived manner.', ""Loved the first two, seriously they were awesome, everything about them, action, drama, comedy, suspense ... everything, they were perfect. This third movie didn't feel the same though, felt more like a TV show or something, I was bored through most of it. The only great things about the movie was spider man and ant man. They made the movie."", ""I mean, he was right to do that, wasn't he? Bucky was innocent, Ross was on his ass to keep the bond between SHIELD and...the only source of vibranium? Seriously? Tony could absolutely suck up to T'Challa and save the team a lot of grief- and shave off some of the truly epic runtime."", '""Are you Tony Stank?""Ahhh the actions just keep getting better and better. But now we had more superheroes fighting each other. Of course the best was Spiderman who was both funny and charismatic.As entertaining as the action, I felt the story wasn\'t as strong as in Winter Soldier. However, it\'s still a good story that led to awesome fight scenes.For sure one of the best trilogies. 9/10.', ""I loved every second of Captain America: Civil War. Everything was so well put and the story and plot worked very smoothly. This movie is everything Batman V. Superman should've been. Every character fit right and at no point did the movie feel crammed with superheroes. In my opinion, the two heroes that stole the show was Spider-Man and black panther. They got both of these characters right especially black panther. As much as I loved Batman V. Superman, I have to give this movie more credit. The Russo brothers did not disappoint and they delivered another marvel masterpiece just like the winter soldier. This movie was very good and I plan on seeing it again when it comes out to all theaters and maybe a couple more times! This movie made me very excited to see what comes next in the MCU."", ""While I don't think this film deserves the immense praise it is receiving, I truly think it is a lot of fun and is one of the better MCU films. The acting in this film is all very good, Robert Downey Jr plays Tony Stark great, like he always does, and Chris Evans fits the role of Steve Rogers well. The film juggles many characters, and for the most part, does a good, commendable job, though some characters, like Hawkeye or Rhodey, get very little to do and aren't as fun to watch as some others. Tom Holland kills it as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, he certainly is the best Spidey to date. Every scene with him is great and fun to watch. Chadwick Boseman does a great job at Black Panther, and the character is interesting and entertaining. Once more Paul Rudd is funny and likable as Ant-Man, even though he is sorely underused, he does get time to shine when he turns into Giant Man. Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen are good and Vision and Scarlet Witch, respectively, and their characters have nice arcs.The story is well put together and runs smoothly for the most part. It does gets convoluted towards the end, but it mostly works. The villain is one note and has no charisma, but his motivations tie into the film nicely, and he gets some time to shine. The cinematography is quite boring, under saturated and gray. The airport fight is severely hurt by the amount of gray in it.The action in this film is handles magnificently, aside from a couple of shaky segments, like the tunnel chase, which was straight out of Taken 2. The big fight scene at the airport is extremely fun, and it is great seeing all these unique powers playing off each other. Ant-Man turning giant is pure fan-service, but it adds a great dynamic to the battle and in turn makes it more fun.The film has good emotion, specifically towards the end, when it is revealed that Bucky murdered Tony's parents, which leads to a heart wrenching conclusion.Overall, while I can't quite grasp giving the film a 10/10, I did enjoy it, and feel that it is a great addition to the MCU."", 'One of the best marvel movies,great character development,good storyline\nA great answer to the question "" how will the governments of today act if superheroes existed?', ""For a long time I thought the idea of a movie where superheroes got into teams and fought would be cool. And, although it was pretty good in the fighting scenes and plot, I hated the ending. I knew it was gonna happen. Film companies always do this thing where if they create teams of good guys they more or less make it a draw so that no one watching feels disappointed when the team they were routing for loses. This bugs me a major amount. I want them to declare a winner even if it's not the team that I am routing for. It just makes marvel look kinda like a sissy. Building up all this hype about picking a side, and then they don't even pick one themselves"", 'This movie\'s entire marketing campaign is exactly the same as WWE\'s Survivor Series, asking the viewers if they\'re #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan. How about #TeamNeither? Well the movie doesn\'t disappoint if you were expecting WWE with superheroes. This movie was a massive insult to my intelligence. It was one big contradiction after another that I was enraged by the end.You remember how HYDRA infiltrated SHIELD and the government in the last Captain America movie? Seems like it would\'ve been an easy setup for Civil War amongst the heroes right? Well the writers don\'t remember this because absolutely zero of HYDRA infiltrating things was mentioned in this movie. Instead the film wants us to think the Avengers are now reckless heroes who killed mass amounts of casualties in their battles in the previous films despite there being no prior hints this was the case. If you can believe this massive contradction that was never addressed before, this is what motivates the United Nation to force superheroes to register as government employees. Two things here: 1) Aren\'t the Avengers already government employees? They work for SHIELD which is the government. And have a military headquarters which also comes off as government. 2) The United Nations were the same people who fired a nuke at NYC during the alien invasion in Avengers 1! That was somehow better than what the Avengers did? There\'s some more idiocy in this one scene, but I won\'t get too detailed into it because the movie forgets about this plot point by next scene. I kid you not. As you probably seen in the commercials, the Avengers are back to destroying things like airports by the halfway mark.The rest of the movie consist of chasing Winter Soldier which is the prime motivator to get the characters to go all WWE on each other. Anyone remember Electro from Amazing Spiderman 2? Remember how his character went from a Spiderman fan to his enemy without any real reason? Well I hope you enjoyed Electro\'s character development (or lack of) because pretty much everyone in this movie is going to do the same thing. Hawkeye last we saw him just wanted to retire with his family. Well here he\'s betraying his former friends and risk losing his family to help a wanted assassin because screw reasons. This is made worse how the film even brings up the people he\'s fightng are his best friends. Ant Man is now mysteriously best friends with Falcon and Falcon even has him on speed dial despite they\'re only meeting was their fight when Paul Rudd was trying to break into Avengers HQ and Falcon was trying to arrest him. Did Ant Man became good friends with all the henchmen he beat up in his solo film too? Rudd was trying to show his family he\'s a changed man and reconnect with his daughter. So what does he think is a good way to show that? Betray the government fight the Avengers, help a wanted assassin and risk being thrown in jail which *spoilers* he does get thrown in jail. Why did he do all of that? Your guess is as good as mine. Scarlet Witch is established to have Vision taking care of her in this movie, and flips sides shortly after. Wdoes she all of a sudden attack her caretaker to help Steve\'s cause? She\'s an idiot I guess. Yes these are the ""reasons"" the film gives us for this ""civil war"".Believe it or not, this film actually has a ""villain"" that most people including myself forgot even existed until others brought him up. Yes he\'s that insignificant to the film outside being the one initiating all the problems with Winter Soldier. He\'s typical forgettable villain trying to kill the heroes, except here he wants the heroes to fight each other instead. You want to know what his plan is?\nGet resources to build up army then find new super soldier serum formula to power up army.Find codes to Winter Soldier so he\'s effectively part of your team.Kill the dad of a non Avenger and frame it on Winter Soldier so non Avenger can kill Winter Soldier.Seize every opportunity to have the heroes try and kill Winter Soldier if non Avengers fails.Kill new super soldier army while they\'re frozen.Initiate fight between Captain America and Iron Man by revealing Winter Soldier killed Tony\'s mom. This step not only requires for only these three to be in a room together, but for his previous steps to have failed.Kill himself.???ProfitsYes people this is what actually happened in the movie. Everything I said is meant to be taken seriously and not a farce or parody. This movie really has a thing for taking anything resembling continuity and logical sense, bringing into the back and shooting it. Other memorable parts of this idiot train is the ""villain"" great plan to initiate another Winter Soldier fight while he\'s in captivity in the good guy\'s HQ, Iron Man refusing the follow Winter Soldier\'s lead to capture the ""villain"" which is what caused the whole airport fight to now deciding to follow Bucky\'s lead BY THE NEXT SCENE! Apparently his change of heart was caused by Tony being mortified that when heroes get arrested, they go to jail. As well as Black Panther going Electro after spending the movie refusing to believe that Bucky didn\'t kill his father, and the most laughable of them all, the film actually tries to make you believe the heroes fractured because of the ""villain\'s"" moronic plan. No they fractured because the heroes in this franchise can\'t stop beating each other up, and this time a number of them thought it was a great idea to help a wanted assassin along the way for no reason. And that could\'ve easily been prevented if the other heroes just followed Bucky\'s lead at first instead of deciding to follow his lead the next scene later after they already destroyed an airport. This film emphasizes what\'s wrong with the Marvel Cinematic Universe films. These films main priorities evidently is to have as much shameless fight scenes as possible and to bait for upcoming characters whose payoffs are just going to be more WWE fight scenes. And the filmmakers will do anything to achieve these fight scenes regardless how much it butchers story development, character development, continuity and anything resembling logical sense. It\'s harder to name a MCU movie with more than one hero where the heroes are actually getting along from beginning to end rather than a MCU movie with more than one hero where they can\'t stop wanting to beat each other up because that\'s all the MCU seems to care about. Anyone who tells you this movie is ""emotionally deep"", ""thought provoking"", ""morally complex"" and anything that tries to make this movie sound beyond a WWE match is lying to you. Any message this film could\'ve had will get trampled all over it and thrown it into a wood chipper sooner or later as the film progresses. This is possibly the worst movie I\'ve seen in 2016 and possibly the worst MCU movie so far, though I\'m sure Marvel Studios will make me eat my words later on.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Rather than giving you my own two cents (well, I WILL give you those, but later), I would like to let the people directly involved in The Meg share their - refreshingly honest - thoughts on it, because they had some very interesting things to say that helped me better understand what I\'d just seen. Let\'s start with Jason Statham\'s recent interview with Frosty Weintraub. You\'ll notice Jason tries to be diplomatic, but he has a very hard time concealing the fact that he\'s not too happy with the finished product:""The film changed a lot. The script was totally different. There was so many different ... sometimes you just go: How did it happen? How did it go from this to this to this to that? I guess if you have the control to keep it a certain way you would, but you don\'t. They have so many people deciding on what action stays and what scenes stay. How the characters ... In the end they want to put something at the beginning. The whole thing at the beginning where I *spoiler* do a rescue on a sub? That was not in the script that I read. That was all brand new stuff. Good or bad, I\'m just letting you know. But (originally) there was other stuff at the beginning that was ... I\'m, you know. I\'m just saying it was radically different.""""I guess in some ways your imagination and your own perception of what it\'s going to be is its worst enemy. John (Turteltaub)\'s interpretation of this is a fun end of summer movie. It\'s full of humor. He\'s put his very light-hearted way into it(...). It\'s a little bit more directed to a different taste of what my own is in terms of I like more gory adult stuff. You go: Where\'s the effing blood?! It\'s like, there\'s a shark. I\'m a lot older but I can\'t speak for what this film could possibly speak to a younger audience. I might have made a film that not many people wanted to see. I\'m not a filmmaker.""""I\'m sort of an actor that\'s going to portray a role. I go there but I\'ve learned not to get too attached with your own idea of what something could be. I don\'t know. As an audience goer you\'re spared all of that sort of things that can ruin a movie for you. I think as you\'re involved in these films you get more and more critical and going: That bit there should have spent more money on the CG. That bit there they should have made that more gory. Where\'s the other bit that was in the original? You get very critical.""And director Jon Turteltaub had this to add in a recent interview with a horror-oriented film site: ""I am so disappointed the film wasn\'t more bloody or disgusting. My wife is glad about it, and I\'m glad my kids can see the movie, but the number of really horrifying, disgusting and bloody deaths we had lined up that we didn\'t get to do is tragic. We shot or even did a lot of visual effects for gory scenes. There was some really good shìt that didn\'t survive to the final cut.""As Statham and the director both alluded to in their interviews, apparently, during post-production the decision was made that The Meg would have to be appropriate for teenagers, and the film was significantly re-cut. When Turteltaub was asked if he would like to see his own, unrated version released, he said: ""Yes. Mine would have a lot gorier, but funnier, deaths for people. It\'s just awesome. Killing people in movies is a lot of fun.""So there you have it folks, the star and the director seem none too pleased about studio mandated changes to their movie in their assessment of the theatrical cut. I\'ve watched the film despite myself, and it\'s actually nowhere near as bad as I feared - it\'s fun in a harmless, forgettable kind of way - but what Statham and Turteltaub are implying is spot on: the whole film constantly teases you with unfulfilled potential. Now let\'s hope we get the better version upon home release.', 'Honestly this film has not only the worst dialogue of any movie this summer/year. It is the worst dialogue I have ever heard in a bad movie ever. Deep Blue Sea, The Shallows, and Jaws 3 all had better dialogue than this cliche title.The Room directed by Tommy Wiseau and this movie go hand and hand for some of the garbage lines and pacing. Halfway through this movie when it appears to be over, I wished it was finally over, however I knew that there was no way they would end it there.Save your money. This will be streamable in 4 months and on sale for $15.', ""The Meg' is basically short for 'Jason Statham versus a 75-foot prehistoric shark', and if that doesn't sound like your idea of an exciting late-summer movie, then this slab of B-movie cheese is clearly not for you. Oh yes, the science-fiction horror novel by Steve Alten on which this movie is based was precisely meant to be that sort of pulpy entertainment, and director Jon Turteltaub ensures that his adaptation is balanced squarely between self-awareness and self-seriousness, even though it does start off being more of the latter before tipping into more of the former.So it goes that our introduction to Statham's deep-sea rescue diver Jonas Taylor is no laughing business: in the throes of his latest mission to save the crew of a nuclear submarine trapped at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, Jonas is forced to sacrifice two of his own men inside the submarine after it is purportedly attacked by a giant creature which crushes its hull. Jonas' account of the tragic event is disputed by another key member of his very own crew Dr Heller (Robert Taylor), and after being accused of suffering a psychological meltdown, he retreats to seclusion on a rustic island in Thailand.Five years later, Jonas is given the opportunity to get even with the creature when he is approached by an old friend Mac (Cliff Curtis) to lead an urgent operation to save his ex-wife Lori (Jessica McNamee) and her two other crew mates stranded underwater in a deep sea submersible names Origin off the Chinese coast. Mac and Lori are part of a larger team on a modern research facility called Mana One exploring if there is life beneath the depths of the ocean as we know it, and the first successful so-called 'insertion' (cue the geek joke delivered by Masi Oka and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) into the hydrothermal sphere at the bottom of the seabed brings the Origin face to face with the titular super shark previously thought to be extinct.At first, Jonas' history means he is greeted with scepticism by the team on board Mana One, including chief oceanographer Dr Zhang Minway (Winston Chao), his equally accomplished daughter Suyin (Li Bingbing) and no less than Jonas' former colleague Dr Heller himself. It goes without saying that Jonas will quickly prove that he wasn't crazy after all, but after having also rescued Suyin who had valiantly but foolhardily gone to try to rescue Lori on her own, the two divorcees will begin to sketch the contours of a romance through some rare character moments, many of which also wisely draw on the precocious charms of Suyin's eight-year-old daughter Meiying (Shuya Sophia Cai).It should come as no surprise that 'The Meg' is built on a number of elaborate action-driven set-pieces mostly executed by Mr Statham, but it is also worthwhile acknowledging that Turteltaub and his screenwriters (comprising of genre specialists Dean Georgaris and Jon and Erich Hoeber) do give the characters just enough texture to craft some memorable scenes within these set-pieces. Among the notable archetypes on display here are the self-absorbed financer Morris (Rainn Wilson), the tough-as-nails independent female type Jaxx (Ruby Rose), as well as the timid plus-sized African-American comic relief DJ (Page Kennedy)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A story about something that is not named merging with Jean Grey, aliens that are not named coming to take control over it - by using sheer number and physical strength, obviously, a government that goes from hailing the X-Men to mutant detention facilities in a day and characters that switch from love to murderous hate in seconds. Nothing makes any sense! The film connects to none of the previous films, has actors in it just for the sake of killing them off or doesn't have them at all, in some cases. It's just a standalone X-men-like film that just doesn't seem to be part of the same thing. It looks like someone tried to make a Mutant-X film and randomly got the rights for the X-Men in the process. Why was this done at all?"", ""Is the movie a masterpiece? No. Is it the worst X-men movie ever? Definitely not. Have you seen the last stand, Apocalypse or Orgins? Does this movie have deep themes, amazing visuals, complex characters, and fully developed relationships? No but its straight forward and doesn't really have any holes. Has Mystique completely given up? Oh beyond. Did we need aliens? No, no we did not. Are storm and Quicksilver depressingly underused? Sadly yes. Are Jean and Cyclops just ok? Yea but Beast, Charles and Magneto are still giving it their all. that mini mutant civil war fight was pretty cool and I really liked the train sequences.

And this film brought nothing. It all felt so hollow. The characters didn't ring true. The story didn't ring true. It was all over the place with many nonsensical choices throughout. I was so excited for my favorite storyline and was disappointed more than I can put into words. This political and social propaganda piece missed the mark by miles."", ""The storyline is pretty decent. But Sophie Turner's poor Acting skills just kills the whole movie.

Seriously?!?! (what did she do to deserve such an honor???)and the fundament, the basis, the Heart, the Mind, the One who formed and gathered them all together... is reduced to a sad (not even old!) man who wastes his time as a retired old man and Magneto comes to him to sweeten his days of exile by treating him to a final game of chess?!?!?!?!To destroy the very core of X-Men is to destroy the X-Men... and somehow this ""director"" has managed to do so... and i\'m sure it wasn\'t unwillingly...The acting was utterly bad (the good actors had no script to act with, Sophie Turner had no talent to act with) - the music was utterly nonsensical (Hans dear, stop falling asleep on the keyboard while composing), the same score stretched continuously for half a movie, then a slightly different score playing continuously for the other half... - the dialogue was stuttered (for all of them) - the camera angles with lots of close-ups tried to give the illusion of emotional weight, but failed miserably - the whole movie felt like a looooong bad dream, or like the spawn of someone who messed up his brain with some w**d and then got into the director\'s and writer\'s chair...Applauses, simon k., for destroying such an wonderful franchise!...', 'If superhero fatigue has set in then 20th Century Fox has borne the brunt of it. Their reboot of The Fantastic 4 flopped. Dark Phoenix was a disaster at the box office and critically maligned. It brought nothing to the X-Men saga and the merger of the film studio with Disney seems to be in the nick of time. The X-Men future lie with the MCU and this film hints at it as when the are forcibly on the train by the Mutant Containment Unit (MCU!)Dark Phoenix is set in 1992 when the X-Men are called by the American President to save the space shuttle mission when it encounters a cosmic phenomena. The X-Men save the crew on an extremely hazardous mission with Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) absorbing the energy from the phenomena. This leads to her powers going on overdrive and Jean becomes a threat to everyone around her. Jean feels that she has been betrayed by Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) who withheld some vital information from her regarding the death of her parents.Jean is now vulnerable to Vuk (Jessica Chastain) a shapeshifting alien who wants Jean\'s power to invade Earth. After being refused help from Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) about controlling her rage, she is finds herself being easily manipulated by Vuk.Director and writer Simon Kinberg has tried to do something different with the franchise and it is better than the bloated X-Men: Apocalypse. The movie starts with a high moment for the X-Men after the space shuttle being saved, they are feted as heroes. It is a realisation of Xavier\'s dreams that humans and mutants can co-exist.However there is also resentment in the camp. Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) thinks that the team is put in the way of unnecessary danger for the sake of glory. Raven even tells Xavier: ""The women are always saving the men around here. You might want to think about changing the name to X-Women."" In an era of #Me Too at least she does point to the oddity of the name of team being called X-Men.The story never flies, it limps along with an uninspired plot. It shakes up when Xavier\'s group combine with Lehnsherr\'s to fight the shapeshifters. The special effects are very good, the action scenes are effective. Sophie Turner is not strong enough an actress to convey Jean Grey\'s turmoil, she comes across more as a spoilt brat. Chastain is wasted as the big bad, she is just required to look good in killer high heels and a blond wig.', 'I enjoyed watching this movie.I almost did not because of the low rating and negative reviews.I am glad I took the risk. While watching, I kept wondering why people find it too bad. It is not the best X-Men movie, but it is very enjoyable.Also, Sophie Turned did a very good job. I loved her face expressions when Jean went dark.', ""Sophie Turner seems like a wonderful person but acting just isn't her thing. she barely pulled off Sanaa in Got and giving her the lead here was just a mistake.She has no charisma, I don't identify with her character (which is the best thing one of the main protagonists) and just don't care about her.The movie is also a mess and seems like editing made it worse. For me, I just couldn't get behand the protagonist at all and wasn't invested."", ""I just got out of seeing Dark Phoenix and here are my early thoughts, all together I'd say I enjoyed it. Is it a great finale? No, but due to the Fox and Disney circumstances I'll cut them some slack. The ending left me wanting more and in this case that isn't a good thing. Some of the story telling in this movie I really liked but there were scenes I wish they would have taken a bit further. I felt this was one of those movies that would have really benefited from an R rating. The final act was what really held it back for me, although there were some really great visuals it just felt like a mess. I think if you go in with the right mindset you will enjoy this film. It's a shame these actors will all be recasted by Disney because there are some AMAZING actors in this cast. I'll give the movie overall a 6.8/10. Certainly not worth the hate it's getting."", ""If you are a fan of the other X-men movies, you will definitely like Dark Phoenix. All the main characters do a good job, especially McAvoy, Fassbender and Sophie Turner. I wasn't sure about Sophie as Jean, but she captured Jean's turbulence well.\nThe story barely follows the original Dark Phoenix, but it still does a good job finding its own way, and it touches on two or three impactful scenes from the original story, which helps connect it to the comic book version.\nAnother nice touch is that the fight scenes seem much more coordinated in this X-movie, it's not just random fighting. Finally, the score and especially the sound effects were great. Very immersive."", 'This film ain\'t the best nor the worst, but it was below-average for me. Like, I\'ve seen worse. I would say the the only pros I could give about this movie would be the acting was good for the most part, the music (done by Hans Zimmer) was electrifying, and the 3rd act was the best part if the movie. But the rest is just blatant exposition, cringe-worthy dialogue, some wasted potential shown there.\nBut like I said earlier, it ain\'t like ""Fant4stic"" or the recent ""Hellboy"" movie, but I would say it falls behind the disappointment that is: X-Men Apocalypse.', ""What a waste of talent of the A lister stars to play like a supporting roles for Sophie Turner just simply not workout. She's just like a wooden stick, flat and boring. About Raven also not make any sense., so why should we care about all this characters at all then? Story line seems to be rushing all the way, this is 2019 so I think the director insulting the audiences intelligent. I felt sad and angry after the film finished."", 'Professor X finally sees his own flaws and how manipulation of the mind, no matter the positive intentions, can really screw things up. Dark Phoenix has a simple storyline with some poor performances from Sophia Turner yet I still loved seeing her in action.I also loved the fact that Storm, Beast, Cyclops and Magneto got a lot of action scenes. Overall the film seems flat yet has some interesting concepts that if explored deeper and with greater emotion could have made the film stand out.', 'I love X-Men, I watched every single one in the past 20 years multiple times and while I did enjoy some more than others, I never hated any film. I closed my eyes to small mistakes and forgave them anything. Not this time.Instead of going out strong and leaving a good impression after so many years, they did the exact opposite. The movie is distorted, rushed, predictable, flat and overall unimpressive. Everything looks cheap from the costumes to the decorations. The actors are uninterested in the movie and look like they just want to deliver their weak lines and get done as soon as possible. Nobody at Fox cared about this movie so why should we? I am sad for what was done to my beloved franchise.#moviesshmovies', 'At some point they are going to understand that Dark Phoenix needs to be built up to intead of just thrown in like an excited child into a happy meal.This and last stand did the same thing of a few ""oh she is strong moments"" and then boom dark phoenix.In the comics she has a few origin variations. The one most knownid the animated series version with the alien force that is helping out, gets a bit comfortable and dose t want to go away again.Hopefully when the MCU gets going they can give it the build up it needs to allow the awesome story it deserves.No fault bu Sophie Turner of Famke Jenson but better writing needed.', ""After reading the reviews today, I almost didn't go see Dark Phoenix. My wife and I both love the franchise, but the last few offerings have been pretty bad. But we chose to go anyway and we actually enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. I don't know why some people can't except a movie to be just entertainment. After the movie ended we both looked at each other and agreed that it was actually better than some of the previous Marvel movies that received much higher ratings. Please go and see it and you be your own judge."", 'I don\'t know why this entry gets the most dislike of the ""young"" team films. I waited an awful long time to finally watch it myself, and yes there\'s things about it that could be better, but there\'s a lot about it I liked.I liked this portrayal of the Phoenix better than the original trilogy take on it. Though the aliens were sort of a weak antagonist to insert. I greatly appreciate - above all else - this film diving deeper into the controversy of Professor Xavier.My favorite thing about the X-Men when I was growing up, is just how much of it fell into shades of gray. And even as an adult. Xavier has good intentions but he\'s a man who can force his will on anyone. Eric is a man who\'s methods are questionable but he tends to want similar end goals. I\'ve seen in comics Cyclops go from the biggest Boy Scout of all time to becoming someone on par with Magneto as a villain while Wolverine became the ideal ""good guy."" X-Men has always felt more fluid than most comics in regards to right and wrong, good and bad, and the different perspectives surrounding those concepts. And this film tackling the way Xavier\'s good intentions can lead to less than desirable methods, and whether or not a man like him should be able to make the calls he makes, was a nice change of pace as opposed to the simplistic ""this side good, that side bad.""At the end of the day, with all X-Men films considered as a whole, they all could have been done so much better. Especially if anyone could have foreseen the scale comic films would have reached when X-Men first released. I won\'t judge any of them overly harshly as they\'ve truly tried to make their entirety of their film franchise work together with time travel and alternate timelines, and tried to explore those gray areas where good and evil aren\'t so cut and dry.The instrumental soundtrack to this is pretty killer too.', ""Tackling the story arc of Jean Grey for the second time yet ending up with the same disappointing results, Dark Phoenix concludes the 20th Century Fox's X-Men saga on an underwhelming note and is one of the blandest entries in the franchise. Dull, predictable & utterly forgettable, it is as redundant as a sequel can get, and happens to be terrible on most levels if not all.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

And indeed, this 23rd Bond outing, superbly directed by the usually reliable Sam Mendes, does just that, pausing appropriately to settle down leisurely over a drink, for some flirtation, some tense verbal confrontation, some self-reflection and brooding just before cutting away to some clean-cut, thrilling action. The result is the uniquely named 'Skyfall' a Bond film so full of the vintage charm and charisma yet fashioned in modern, urban and instantly accessible style that it ends up being one of the finest films of the franchise.Yes, Mendes' film is a solid revamp of the Bond franchise, bringing in welcome dollops of humor, luxury and sensuality that went missing from the franchise with the last outing. And impressively enough, there is enough emotion without slowing things down, enough tension and action without making it too frenetic and the pacing is so, so perfect that you seldom feel the film falling short or dragging too long.Pretty much everyone would agree that the 60s were the heyday of the Bond films. Those Sean Connery-starrers were primarily all about the leading man and his ladies but each was fashioned with such a slick ease, wise-ass humor and layer-cakes of moments that we embraced them all as subversive classics. 'Skyfall' fortunately, is a film that reaches up to that caliber.Clearly, the best thing about the film is the pacing. Mendes is in no hurry to let the film unravel. The story begins in Istanbul, with Bond and his side-kick Eve Moneypenny (a sharp-tongued Naomie Harris, smarter than ever), chasing down a man with a list. The action scenes come in neatly and the opening pursuit shifts from a hectic bike chase on the rooftops to the cliff-hanging fight on top of the train and it all looks truly spectacular.The plot is simple enough- MI6 is under attack from a former agent- a renegade named Silva (Javier Bardem) who has a knack for orchestrating terrorist attacks with a simple click of the mouse.

It\'s not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that\'s because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a \'wink and a nod\' to Fabio). Loretta\'s love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she\'s required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He\'s read her latest book and needs her help in locating the \'Crown of Fire\' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he\'s more than a pretty face. Loretta\'s stressed out literary agent Beth (Da\'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).It\'s regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt\'s cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta\'s rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It\'s mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It\'s an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It\'s meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It\'s totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.Opening in theaters on March 25, 2022.', ""The chemistry between Bullock and Pitt is beyond words even though for only a minute or two. It's so powerful that it dulls the chemistry between Channing and Bullock. It's too bad that Brad wasn't given a much larger role as he has a real knack for comedy. It was likely to keep costs down or maybe he couldn't commit to more shooting days. If budget wasn't an issue I would have written a few more Pitt scenes in and maybe less goat. They tried to milk the goat bit (sorry) and it just wasn't funny. Radcliffe was good too and again he could have used a few more scenes. Still, money well spent just to watch Brad for a few minutes as he stole the entire movie."", ""From the early reviews I thought this was the film to see...but seeing it i'm amazed at those reviews.In short, this was a weak and humorless version of Romancing the Stone.

A few laughs, a few ""awhs"", and a whole lotta ""omg is Channing Tatum hot""\'d.', ""I've seen a lot of enjoyable Sandra Bullock movies and quite a few enjoyable Channing Tatum movies. They are both appealing popcorn movie stars. But this movie was like every stupid, unfunny, cringey, annoying scene that they've ever been in, all rolled into one movie. The screenplay was embarrassingly bad, and it brought out all of Bullock's and Tatum's worst tendencies. Daniel Radcliffe was a bland villain, and Da'Vine Joy Randolph's scenes were practically unwatchable. Brad Pitt's character was about the only good thing in the movie. I actually laughed when he was onscreen. But when he got literally blasted out of the picture early on, it drained all of the life out of him and the movie."", ""Bonkers that this film is rated only 6.1 on Imdb right now--it's better than that. Proof that folks who rate movies on here are sometimes guilty of the same crime that professional critics frequently make--looking the gift horse in the mouth. As you can see folks, this is not an art-house film--it's pure entertainment, and it delivers on that count.My wife and I saw this in the theater--the Brad Pitt cameo alone is worth the price of admission and both Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock have lots of funny lines and pure situational/physical comedy too. What's not to like? A cast that's easy on the eyes and talented to boot, a fairly decent script and a love story with enough heft but still airy and entertaining."", ""... it goes by quickly so it's easy to miss, where Bullock steps out of character for a moment, takes the entire movie, cast, and crew, straps them to her back, and then carries them all to the finale.

This movie was painfully boring.', '3 out of 5 stars.Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum were great with there on screen chemistry and worked great with providing humor. Taking them on a adventure to searching for the lost city before the bad guys go after the search. The cast is good. The concept is fun. The film does have some humor and entertainment. The plot is forgettable. And the film does have a small amount of humor that cant carry the movie.', '2022\'s The Lost City is just plain fun. Escapists and popcorn munchers are welcome. It\'s one of those action-adventure vehicles where the protagonists supply the sarcastic quips in the face of swashbuckling danger. ""Jungles eat people like us"". Need I say more.Directed with jungly cinematography by those Nee brothers (Aaron and Adam), ""City"" is like the goofy cousin of a certain \'84 Robert Zemeckis flick and any Indiana Jones endeavor. It\'s a riff but a good riff that\'s not to be taken as serious. There\'s supposed hidden treasure, chases, snakes featured, and for added effect, leeches too.The Lost City stars Sandra Bullock as a novelist who gets kidnapped when one of her stories reveals the location of fortune in an ancient burgh (sound familiar?). The role of writer Loretta Sage is perfect for a bumbling, physical comic like Bullock. It\'s like her agent said, ""oh yeah, this is a no-brainer"".""City"" also has Brad Pitt in it as a Navy Seal (Jack Trainer) sent to rescue Sage from the already rich baddies. When he exits, well it\'s almost a buzzkill. Piggybacking on his intimidating persona via Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Pitt just reminds us again that he\'s a legend. His bone-crunching action sequences in ""City"" give the film a shot in the arm that doesn\'t quite sustain for the rest of the running time (1 hour-plus). Sure ""City"" is motion full tilt but finishes with less cowbell.In thinking back, ""City\'s"" look could almost pass as boost animation. The dialogue is improvised, the characters are dispassionate (yet funny), and because of the breezy tone (intertwined with PG-13 violence), The Lost City is a true to type, moviegoer\'s movie.

Channing Tatum is not the lead I usually go for but the chemistry between him and Sandra was surprising. Honestly my main motivation for watching was Daniel Radcliff and he did not disappoint. What a fun character. Of course the story was silly, but i laughed out loud multiple times.What else to make this review longer...leaches, yuck. Naked back side...yay! Slow dancing...nice. Blood...ewe. Stuffy high brow reviews...boo. People who enjoy getting away from it all for a few hours without over analyzing...woohoo! Give it a try if this attitude resonates with you.', 'This was rough. I guess I put my expectations too high from the previews. The part with Brad Pitt was fine the rest a typical Sandra Bullock overreacting to mild inconveniences and complete stupidity. Shoutout to the marketing team for making this look like something I would enjoy when I knew better, but thought maybe? Just maybe? Well I knew better. This is terrible.', ""Novice writers and directors brother duo the Nee's did an impressive job with this full length feature film, especially considering their previous works were mainly shorts. The 112 runtime was used up well, although a little faster pacing and/or some scenes trimmed down would've shown better. Casting and performances were excellent, especially Channing Tatum who was the main source of laughs. The story is not revolutionary, but did have some refreshing changes to the genre. It's a fun and entertaining one time watch, especially if you're a fan of any of the lead cast."", ""The Plot makes NO SENSE, the Jokes are DRY & Not Funny at all, there is ZERO CHEMISTRY between Bullock & Tatum.I am Shocked that Paramount actually gave this movie the Greenlight to start with, the Script is very weak with dry humor throughout the film.This film is so stupid, it's an embarrassment..."", ""I saw a screening of this and thought hey it's probably gonna be another cheesy action comedy but hey free. I didn't have high expectations but I have to say this movie was HILARIOUS! Good action. Really good comedy and even though it's 2 hours long it was good pacing. Definitely worth a watch!"", ""I wouldn't pay a premium price to see this, but it's funny and fun. Some great laughs, Gotta say, Sandra Bulloch's behind looks pretty fine for a woman in her fifties. Channing Tatum is a good foil for Bulloch's brainy character, although his character's evolution doesn't seem very consistent throughout the movie. Dan Radcliffe makes a convincing villain and Brad Pitt is a very amusing supporting character without stealing the movie. It just goes to show that good actors and a decent plot and writing can make even lightweight fare quite satisfying, for an afternoon matinee, at least. There's a sequel suggested...I'd definitely consider seeing that one."", ""1st time I've ever walked out of a cinema. What were the actors thinking signing up to this movie?The only good performance was from Brad Pitt - he must be regretting this now."", ""I think you get a real 90s/2000s vibe from this movie. Reminds me of The Mummy or Sahara and the like. It would be right at home getting released early 2000s. I like that it's a parody of those serious adventure movies. You don't get movies made like this these days. Switch off and enjoy the pretty island like you're on holidays. I think the reviews are way too harsh on this movie. It ticks alot of boxes, does alot of things right and doesn't take itself too serious. I don't know what these people were expecting with the bad reviews, it's a adventure/comedy movie with some romance chucked. Just enjoy it for what it is.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It has tons of elements that are used heavily in future MCU films, egFleshing out Hawkeye°In this film we get to see the other side of Hawkeye, we learn about his family, who would played a vital role to his character\'s dark turn in Endgame.°This movie also solidifies his relationship with Black Widow which makes her demise in endgame even more impactful.°He also inspired Wanda to shake off her past and become an Avenger.\nThe arising tension between Steve and Tony° Things started to get sour between Steve and Tony, after him and Bruce accidentally created Ultron and also Vision. And the destruction of Sokovia at the end of the movie is also one of the main reason for the Sokovia Accords, which are all part of the reason that split the superheroes in two sides in CW.\nIntro of Scarlett Witch and Vision°Vision and Scarlett are both introduced in this film, and they both would go on and become crucial members of the Avengers.Thanos had enough° The events of this film upset Thanos so much that he decided to ""do it himself"" which foreshadows the event of Infinity War.\nAvengers as a unit°It\'s also the first appearance of the Avengers functional as a team. They\'re not just meeting and building the team like in the first Avengers, they aren\'t split like in Civil War and Infinity War or broken like in Endgame. They\'re just out there taking on bad guys, hanging out, and fighting evil robots.\nHulk/Bruce banner story arc°Bruce Banner started having problems transforming into the Hulk in this movie which keeps recurring in Infinity War, until ultimately resolved at Endgame.°Hulk buster armor°At the end of this film, Hulk left on the quinjet which from there, you know, Ragnorak.\nWakanda/ Black panther tease°Klaw is first introduced in this film, he would go on to become one of Black panther\'s main villain.

This movie deserve nothing but our utmost respect. 🙌', ""This film isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be. While the story isn't as good as the first Avengers, the acting is still just as good, the action is even better, and Ultron isn't a bad villain, he's just an under-developed one. Honestly, the action makes up for most of the flaws of this movie and it also set up a lot of MCU films, or at least foreshadowed a lot. Movies like Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, and Captain America: Civil War. Overall, this isn't a bad film, at all, but it is the weakest of The Avengers franchise."", '""People stopped being people in 1913.

The third installment of Spider - Man franchise is darker than the first two movies were but still dose not ruined and dose get a job don well!! Before i start writing review about this movie , i wanna talk about the new movie The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) the new movie of Spider - Man is awfully horrible boring and wrong. It truly disappointed me. I have been watching the new movie on DVD than i went watching Spider - Man 3 on DVD this movie i am writing a review about it, i only saw this movie once and the first time i didn\'t give it 10 stars i was actually bored by this film and disappointed about Harry as the villain and that he died Marry Jane broke up with Peter and he become dark but the movie was still enjoyable after i saw how awful badly the new spider - man is i went watching this movie and you know what? It was million times better than the new amazing Spider - crap was. Sam Raimi\'s trilogy was much much better than Marc Webb\'s movie is, Webb\'s movie is awful. I watched the first original movie Spider - Man back in 2003 when my mom bought me original video cassette that was before DVDs and Blu Rays were on this world and i absolutely loved it. When in 2004 was released Spider - Man 2 i bought video cassette right away. Sequel to this movie was supremely good, but it did not compare to the first movie. Then after my huge expectations for, ""Spider - Man 3"", Sam Raimi blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""Spider - Man 3""? Quite simply, Yes! In 2005 when i hear about the third and last movie of Spider - Man that they where shooting i knew that Tobey Maguire had problems in his personal life and how media was judging him, i step on his side right away and this movie did made an awesome job in 2007. About The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) that movie was really shocking and completely different than Sam Raimi\'s trilogy was. The only good thing in that movie was The Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors but the whole movie was really true disappointment and insult for every true Spider - Man fan. A lot of people were criticizing and judging this movie but in my opinion this movie is well made. Think before you judge an threw away a gold of movie and see the new movie and you will see the difference. This movie is a million times much better.Andrew Garfield really isn\'t for the role of Peter Parker as Spider - Man i hear that they are planing new movie another sequel for The Amazing Spider-Man? Please god no! The third and last movie of Sam Raimi\'s trilogy is an epic conclusion to an amazing awesome super hero. I will rather watch this movie than the new spider - crap movie. I am not buying the new movie no thank you. I watch awhile ago Spider - Man 2 and it was so great movie i really loved it. Today i order it Spider - Man 1 and 3 original DVD it will come tomorrow i don\'t have these two movies on DVD. I am also giving a higher rank for this movie than the new one. Just one thing how come this movie got only 6.3 stars while the new movie got 7? that make no sense to me. A great ride from Sam Raimi thank you! 10 out of 10 Stars!The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Tobey Maguire, of course still makes as a great Spider - Man . James Franco is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous.. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing and awesome. Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko is terrific. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is brilliant much, much better than Emma Stone is. Actress Bryce is also beautiful,pretty hot. At last and least Rosemary Harris as aunt May Parker was terrific and fabulous outstanding in her performance. Sally Field got a poor script and she barely talks in Amazing Spider - Man. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors and actresses are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. Spider - Man 3 is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. 10/10', 'This film has received a bad rap from many people. I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.', 'And of course the rumor of three good movies in the franchise was not true. We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It\'s definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we\'re fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it\'s really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn\'t get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn\'t have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that\'s because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.', 'I enjoyed Spider-Man 3 quite a lot. However, there were so many problems with it that I ended up only ""liking"" it instead of loving it like the first two films.Let me get to the pros vs the cons:THE GOODThe Effects: Birth of Sandman is the coolest effect on any film I can remember. Amazing! The fight scenes were also incredibly well realized. The Humor: J.Jonah.Jameson had some hilarious moments - especially his first scene. Bruce Campbell plays a waiter (Maitre D really) in a French restaurant, and it is probably the best scene in the whole movie! Peter dancing! The Action: The first Sandman vs Spidey scene was very exciting. Maybe the best battle sequence from all three films. CGI-Venom looked great in the whole four-minutes of screen time he got. All the fight-scenes were EXCELLENT, well choreographed and exciting.The Acting: James Franco has improved much as Harry. Gwen Stacey was much better used than I expected. (And she was beautiful!) Thomas Haden Church was perfect for Sandman! Topher Grace did a fine job as Brock, not so great as Venom.I guess that is a good intro for...THE BADVenom has WAY too little screen time. His story was too rushed. Sandman is made to look like a good guy, then bad, and at some points we\'re not sure what to think. Do we feel sorry for him? Fear him? The filmmakers couldn\'t decide, and it shows. The Costumes: Harry\'s mask was just ridiculous! Seeing Brock\'s face in the Venom suit looked stupid. And the Dark Spidey suit wasn\'t ""alive"" enough. It just looked like a suit, not a living organism. The Score (music): Some parts were OK but some parts were SO bad it ruined the scene! An example is the over-scoring of the first Dark-Spidey scene (where he\'s hanging upside down looking at himself in a building window). It was painfully bad, screaming out for the audience to be amazed. Like holding up an applause sign. Tacky. Then there were plenty of similar moments, mostly in other action scenes. American Cheese: Spidey landing in front of a HUGE, randomly placed, waving American flag. The camera panning back from a crying MJ and Peter atop a huge building, to make sure we see a sunset in the background, etc. Manipulative tripe. The evil-dudes team-up in the end was very contrived. I didn\'t buy it. How Spidey deals with Sandman in the end was also quite silly. Not cool at all.The biggest problem is trying to squeeze too much into one film. Spider-Man 3 should have been about Sandman and Harry/Goblin. Venom should have been held back for the next one. The fourth film could have been all about Venom, giving him more screen time and the treatment he deserves.I know this was Sam Raimi\'s original plan (not to include Venom in this film) but Avi Arad convinced him to add Venom into the story, for the fans, since everybody loves Venom.Too bad Sam didn\'t follow his plan. I doubt he\'ll come back for more now. Let\'s just hope he gets to make The Hobbit (unless by some miracle Peter Jackson gets to do it after all).Thanks for reading! :)', 'This movie is hilarious. On release, most things were cringe and nowadays people would probably consider this a genius work of art. The whole ""Emo Peter"" thing has made some real comedic gold and ""give me rent"" ""You\'ll get your rent when you fix this da** door!!"" As an actual movie, not so great, Venom wasn\'t done well and some acting was pretty poor... it does have one really emotional scene when Harry Osborne dies (oopS minor spoilerS) Kirsten Dunst\'s MJ is really whiny, the whole damsel in distress thing really got on my nerve sometimes, like get it together woman! I guess you could look at Spider Man 3 as a dark comedy kind of like Evil Dead 2 (another Sam Raimi movie). It is by far the most fun Spider Man movie, I was fully entertained throughout its entire run time even if it wasn\'t flawless or the best spiderman movie. If you hate this movie remember what a wise emo Peter once said ""Want forgiveness? Get religion.""', 'OK, I\'m a HUGE fan of Spiderman...Liked the first movie, LOVED the second flick and was dying to see the third one. And since I live in Korea, I was able to see the movie tonight (SM3 opened in Asia 3 days before it opens in North America). I\'m sad to say, I was let down by the third film.The biggest issue by far is the fact that there are FAR too many story lines going on at once. The movie feels very bogged down and not nearly enough time is given for proper character development.In this movie, there is Spiderman, Mary Jane, Gwen Stacey, ""New"" Goblin Venom and Sandman. Each character is given the bare amount of time for development.I\'m assuming that since most of the cast is non-committal to returning for a fourth movie, the filmmakers decided to throw as many stories into this movie in case it was the end. It really takes away from the movie as a whole.The other big issue I have is the very forced sense of humor the movie tries to take. From a very lame riff on John Travolta\'s walk from ""Saturday night fever"" to watching Peter Parker dance to jazz music, a lot of the humor feels like it\'s was written for a SNL sketch.There is a very poor ending involving Spiderman and Sandman that defies logic.I sincerely hope this is NOT the last Spiderman film, because if it is, it\'s certainly not the best way for the series to end. None of the magic and originality of the second film are here. I hope that a decision is made to do a fourth film and I hope if a fourth film is made, the filmmakers decide to go back to what made the second film so special.** out of *****', ""Yes, Spider Man 2 had a better story, but this is having none of that. This is pure camp and I love every second of it. The lines emo Peter says are legendary, all the things at that point just go instantaneously from 0 to a 100. The fights are actually really good too, I can't see why people view this film so badly? Maybe because it just isn't as serious as the previous ones, but that doesn't have to mean it's bad. I laughed from start to finish and therefore it's much more memorable than Spider Man 1 and 2."", 'While it does at times tiptoe on the line of being an epic and brilliant work of cinema, SPIDER-MAN 3 is also a big case of overkill. There\'s way too much going on, and it just seems to keep on coming.After a somewhat shaky series of opening scenes (with that voice-over narration by Maguire still being as lame as always), the movie quickly finds its balance. It isn\'t until the symbiote subplot (involving the black Spidey suit) gets into full swing that things become a little too hectic. Director Sam Raimi pulls off an incredible feat by making the never-ending onslaught of subplots balance as well as they do, but the pieces still don\'t fit to the extent that you\'d hope. There\'s enough plot here for two or three different movies, with plenty of obstacles for Peter to overcome and an ample amount of baddies for him to fight. But in putting the four main plot lines together (i.e., revenge against Sandman, Peter\'s relationship with Harry, the symbiote suit/Venom, and problems with MJ), the whole experience becomes overwhelming. There\'s not nearly enough time to absorb all the intertwining threads, no matter how hard the filmmakers obviously try to make it work.That\'s not to say this is a bad movie. Far from it. In fact, despite its shortcomings, this picture still marks one of the most fun times I\'ve had at the movies. It wasn\'t even until after I left the screening that I started to realize how many problems it had. I bet a large percentage of moviegoers will feel the same, being so taken aback by the constant action sequences and stream of story lines that they never even get a chance to notice the film\'s problems. That\'s the good news. Bad news is, there\'s no way these issues will go unnoticed upon repeat viewings. While SPIDER-MAN 2 seems to just keep getting better with each consecutive viewing, I see this one coming up short. It\'s still less problematic than the first film (which already feels a bit dated), but it just can\'t compete with the damn near flawless second.One of the few complaints I had with SPIDEY 2 was the ""raindrops are falling on my head"" sequence. It was silly and awkward, not fitting well with the rest of the film\'s style... Well, this sequel tops it. After the symbiote takes over Parker, there\'s a lengthy montage sequence of him (now turned emo) strutting down the street, dancing around and pelvic thrusting at women. It\'s basically him hopping about to music while looking like a jackass. And it gets worse. He goes with Gwen Stacy (a hot but disappointingly extraneous character) to a club, where MJ is currently working, and basically reenacts the scene from ANCHORMAN where Will Ferrell starts randomly playing the trumpet and hopping across tables. There are slight differences, of course";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After seeing the previous two movies, nothing surprised me, not even the illogical stunts they pulled.

Leprechaun is a campy horror-comedy franchise and its self-mocking humor uses the insult to its advantage. F&F has been approaching that line over the years and it may be a moment of jumping the shark. F&F started originally as a semi-serious fun cars & babes franchise. The action has gotten more and more ridiculous to the point of superhero unreality. Tyrese Gibson is doing a meta commentary while questioning his invulnerability. It's fitting that he and Ludacris are the ones going into space. Tyrese is the silly comic relief but it's getting out of hand. This series is being so ridiculous that it is almost critic-proof in that respect. No nay-sayer is going to win an argument by pointing out the outlandish non-sensical action scenes.

If you zig-zag when running away from someone shooting at you with an automatic weapon, you never get hit. Nobody know how to shoot out a tire.

Read all;"['Once you get over a bit of a slow start, the film proves to be entertaining and engrossing, and it draws attention to the inner, sometimes dirty, machinations of government and the jurisdictional ""system"". The acting is also pretty much all-around top-notch. The only thing that I found as a slight negative, is that it really doesn\'t have any kind of re-watchabilty factor. Once you\'ve seen and enjoyed it, as much as one can enjoy a film of this nature, I don\'t find that there is any allure to ever watch it again.', ""This is one of those action movies that it only job is to give you as real as possible experience with its beautiful cinematography. It doesn't feel as real as ''Children of Men'' and it probably won't get a Oscar but it serves its job. The movie may not be as masterful as Villeneuve's original, but it achieves to keep you on the screen. There are really good heart-pumping scenes that beautifully blended with the score in its convoluted plot. Just like in the first movie, the story gets darker and darker. It reflects real-life situations, that's why it's so dreary and compelling. All the events is a buildup to our main story. It all ties together perfectly in the end. And even though key cast member Emily Blunt no longer here, the movie stands alone as a powerful modern-day Western, thanks to the Josh Brolin, Benicio del Toro, and Taylor Sheridan who also penned the screenplay of the first movie.I'll definitely watch this again."", ""Okay, so this doesn't come close to the first movie in the series. But, it comes close enough to being close that it's much more than watchable. It's actually a very good movie. If it was a standalone movie and Sicario never happened, people would more appreciative. Del Toro is his usual badass self. The cartels and U.S. law enforcement are brutal, per the usual. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys fast action."", ""An Islamic suicide bomber is caught crossing the Mexican American border. A Kansas City grocery store is attacked by multiple Islamic suicide bombers. Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) is in Somali interrogating a pirate in the investigation. The bombers are presumed to be Yemeni terrorists transported to Mexico by sea and smuggled in by the drug cartels. The cartels are declared terrorist organization. Graver is brought in to take them down. He recruits Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) to kidnap cartel kingpin's daughter Isabel Reyes and laying the suspicion on a rival cartel. Meanwhile, American teenager Miguel Hernandez has joined the cartel to be a soldado.This sequel has some of the kinetic energy of the original. It has Del Toro and Brolin returning. The suicide bomber crossing the border is questionable. It seems like a tougher step than necessary. There is a fleeting explanation of the Kansas City bombing which leaves the crossing even more questionable. Instead something less blow-em up and reasonable, the movie wants to start with a bang. Same thing happens with the hand-off to the Mexican police. I don't understand why they would try to ambush them. It would be easier to trick them into transferring Isabel to them. The shootout can happen when something goes wrong with the exchange. There are things happening that don't quite seem right although much of it can be attributed to the randomness of a chaotic situation. Overall, there is a kinetic thrill to diving back into this world. The actors are compelling. It may not be a necessary sequel but it's a worthwhile sequel."", ""I thought this movie was pretty good. It's a follow-up to the absolutely terrific film Sicario but it doesn't quite stay in the same tier as the original. The acting is still just as good as the first. Brolin and del Toro are incredibly talented and the new actors/actresses like Isabela Moner did a fantastic job. I just thought some characters weren't consistent with their actions like the first one. Especially del Toro's character, it was written a bit weirdly and the ending was kind of odd compared to what I would have expected to happen given their nature in the first movie. I still recommend a watch and even a back-to-back viewing with the original but I really hope they close this series with the cliffhanger and keep it a solid one-two punch. 3.5/5 stars."", ""Struggling to understand the sub 6 scores.This isn't meant to be a popcorn die hard style action flick. Instead it shows the dark and seedy sides in the cartel and Gov't conflict in both sides of the border.Really hope there is a 3rd instalment made"", 'My first review: Loved the first Sicario. Raw and different. This time I almost walked out of the cinema. Really bad. Could not believe its the same screenwriter. The story is really thin (and short). The overacting by Isabela Moner was too much on many moments. May not be her fault, but the director. Benico and Josh did an excellent job, but the movie is just bad. Most annoying is the rating her. The first 21 (!!) gave it a 10/10. The Godfather Part II came to seven (7). So something is really wrong. Really annoying because I really trust IMDB.', ""Not as good the the first one but held my attention throughout. If you can bear the plot holes and just go with it then definitely worth a watch.\nBenicio as always is great to watch and most of the cast do a great job. I'd recommend it if you enjoyed the first one."", 'The 2nd Sicario movie was really decent ... until the end. Alejandro never got revenge on Reyes (maybe in the future??) - there is no follow up on what happened w/ Matt\'s decision to keep the girl alive in witness protection (closure there a year later would have made more sense then the ""future sicario"" ending) - also the ending is bad in that how the hell does Alejandro w/ his brains falling out of his head able to not only walk enough to catch up to the cars (without water) - and then drive the car to a hospital. It\'s just not believable. That being said Brolin and Tel Torro are phenomenal in this movie. I would watch a 3rd just because of those two.', 'Where the original Sicario was carried by the suspence created by the contrasting naive FBI-agent Macy (Emily Blunt), the cynical CIA-agent Matt (Josh Brolin) and the vengeful \nAlejandro (Benicio del Toro) as ruthless sicario turned against the drug carlets operating along the US-Mexico border, the sequal lacks this tension and becomes an analogue and rather predictable story. Decent acting performances, and attempts to recreate the original dark athmosphere cannot save the weak plot, where several interesting issues launched at the start are not followed through. This makes for a rather unfulfilling experience, despite hints of another sequal.', ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado is a movie that clings on to the best elements of the original, but was not brave enough to try something new. The score, cinematography and the performances were spot on, keeping the viewers on the edge of their seats, however the story telling falls slightly short. Despite the writer being the same for the both the movies, this movie lacks cohesiveness as there is too much going on. Also unlike the first, with Emily Blunt's character, there is no one for the viewers to anchor to or walk them through the movie. Despite all that, there is still the same toughness and tension throughout the movie and the score was brilliant even without the late Johann Johannsson.\nTo conclude, the movie is a visual treat with some brilliantly choreographed action sequences and is a must watch if you are a fan of the original."", 'I saw ""Sicario:Day of the Soldado"", starring Josh Brolin-Avengers:Infinity War, True Grit_2010";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The special effects were well done, and while the action scenes were excellent, there weren't nearly enough of them. Nothing against director David Fincher, but I would not put him in the same class as Ridley Scott and James Cameron (directors of the first 2 films). This movie did not have a great flow. For the better part of an hour, we're left listening to dull dialogue, before the action picks up. At least with the first Alien film, the suspense kept up the pace of the movie. Also, aside from Lt. Ripley, none of the other characters are the least bit interesting in this film. This movie is enjoyable, and better than a many sci-fi movies out there, but I would not consider this one to be a classic."", ""I think I'm being overgenerous in saying this third 'attempt' was disappointing. First off I was devastated by the way Hicks and Newt had been killed off and what can I say about poor Bishop being chucked into the rubbish?Secondly you don't really care for any of the characters like in the previous Alien movies. It didn't help much that they were all bald and so you couldn't tell them apart!! Other than that this film isn't bad (and Resurrection) if you consider this. They never happened! Ripley is still in Hypersleep, having one long nightmare provoked by her experiences on LV426. After all she did end Aliens with Newt asking her 'can I dream?'. So that's what's happened. She'll wake up marry Hicks,adopt Newt and live happily ever after.(Yeah? and then they'll return to earth and discover that Hudson hadn't really died, he'd escaped the aliens clutches, found an abandoned ship and took off before the place was nuked!) Now I'm dreaming! O.k, but seriously I think if they must make ANOTHER alien film, they should try and answer the questions raised from the original movie like...-Where are the aliens from in the first place?-Where did that boneship come from and what/who was the dead pilot?"", ""Alien took my breath away, and was the defining movie that reeled me into Sci-Fi.  Aliens had even more aliens and then came the queen.  Alien 3 didn't need to be told, the story wasn't convincing.  Perhaps the fatal flaw was setting it in a space prison.  It's hard to care for characters who are murderers and rapists.  I wouldn't waist the time to watch this but you should definitely watch the first two."", ""The long delayed sequel to James Camerons Aliens turned out to be a mediocore affair. I remember going to the local movie theater in my teens to see this film with my brother and I was so dissapointed. It just seemed like an inferiour rehash of the first film. No characters to feel a true sympathy for (though Charles Dance's character gets more depth in the new special edition release). Watching the documentary that comes along with the new re-releae you can plainly see the rough time the producers and writers, etc. had in coming up with a story for the third film. In the end what we got was a brave effort but a failure in comparison with the first two films. The fourth one in the series was a better return to form for me anyway."", ""I am one of the people who doesn't dislike this film because it is different, but because it wasn't different enough. Oh no, there is an alien behind you. Look out, it is picking you off one by one. I really didn't think it even tried to do something else. I would've preferred Alien 4 to this one if that one wasn't campy. However, if you liked the first Alien the best out of all the movies, you will probably enjoy this film more than I did. I just kinda enjoyed the combat of Aliens more than the thriller movies. However, Alien was one of the first to do this, so it is a testament to the timelessness of it's concept which we younger viewers take for granted."", ""I blame the downfall of the Alien films partly to this movie. It's when the movies went from being masterpieces to pieces of s***e. It's not as bad as Regurgitation but it's leaning that way. More towards that than towards it's predecessor.Weaver is almost unbearable too look at with her shaved head, and Hicks and Newt are dead. That right there is enough to p*** me off. This movie could have been so much better than this. And come on now, a prison setting? Please. Don't waste my time.I usually like David Fincher so I can forgive him for this, but it still stinks. 6/10."", 'First off, I\'d like to say that had Alien and Aliens never been filmed, Alien3 would\'ve made a good movie just as it is. Unfortunately the reality is that since both of the first 2 movies were great, this movie had high expectations. Ultimately, Alien3 is not worthy to be accepted as part of Alien series.Alien3 had some good acting and music and some excellent cinematography I thought. It was also darker than the first 2. Also, the concept of crashing in a maximum security prison was a good one I thought. But since this review only rationalizes a 3/10 for this movie, I will spend the rest of the time explaining what made this movie a bad one.First of all, it completely ruins the second Alien movie for three reasons: Firstly by introducing the egg that had been on board that had hatched into an alien. How the heck did that egg get there anyway? No explanation is offered. Secondly by introducing the fact that Ripley somehow had a queen alien chestburster inside of her. How did that get there? No explanation is offered. Thirdly by killing off 2 of the main characters from ""Aliens"", Newt and Hicks, right at the very beginning, giving them senseless deaths. Many say this was for ""shock value"". Shock value my ass, it was just a letdown. Killing them off halfway through or something would\'ve been more effective. Besides, they could\'ve developed Newt and Hicks a lot more. The sole fact that the innocent child Newt has to live in a maximum security prison makes for some good character development. Hicks would\'ve been a bit trickier, but with some creativity they could\'ve come up with something (i.e. maybe Hicks went to prison when he was younger and he\'s scared of them now and has to deal with it). Maybe if Hicks and Newt were the first victims, it would\'ve been more satisfying (and then Ripley would be a loner again, which is what her character is all about IMO, as nobody would believe her about the alien again, etc).Another element lacking in the third movie is the absence of one of the dominant themes in the first 2 movies, about the protection of the innocent. Ripley went out of her way to protect Jones (in Alien) and Newt (in Aliens) but there was none of her ""motherly"" role in this movie. I felt this element was important to the first 2 movies, yet it became non-existent in the third.Another negative point was that I feel this movie sort of ruined the image of the alien. Having the alien run after people at high velocities and having the people herd it like a sheep is not what the alien is supposed to be. The aliens are supposed to be slow, sneaky, and stealthy and pop out from behind you when you least expect it. By making the alien run, they were trying to make it scarier, but they actually made it less scary. Come to think of it, the scariest bad guys in movies are never fast moving creatures. And the aliens are supposed to be smart, not stupid. Remember in Alien how the alien was hiding in the escape ship at the end? Or in Aliens how the queen used the elevator and then stowed away? A final point that made this movie bad was a stupid stylistic decision: Kill off the main secondary character, Clemens, halfway through the movie. They had just begun to develop his character, and he could\'ve been the next Hicks or Newt, but no, they kill him off halfway through. Then instead they try to develop the character of Dillon, however, they only get to developing his character halfway through as well. As a result, we have 2 half-developed characters (both of which die by the end), leaving Ripley the only character the viewer really cares about (unlike in Aliens where we had Hicks, Newt, Bishop, Vasquez, Apone, etc).In conclusion, this was a well made movie with terrible stylistic decisions that essentially ruined it. The only good decision was to have Ripley sacrifice herself for the protection of humans at the end. This was done very well and ended off the movie well (albeit it was a sad ending).', 'When the very glue that held the air-tight plot of ALIENS together is torn off its fabric before the film begins, proper, can any amount of ""clever camera angles"" and ""moody set pieces"" fill in the void that is left? That is the question I ask myself because at the time this film was released I was in awe of David Fincher\'s dark images and clever editing, most notably in his videos for Madonna. True, ALIEN 3 tries to bring back the dread that the first movie contained and has some very unnerving sequences, but numerous re-writes leading to Newt\'s off screen death and Ripley\'s impregnation by an alien (as forced as any life-like expression on a mannequin) killed any emotional resonance that otherwise it would have had. This is what happens when money takes over and creativity flies out the window. Everything becomes a color-by-numbers cat and mouse game where everyone is a mouse running away from an alien. Ripley makes some questionable choices which are out of character early in the film and the time it takes for her own alien to pop out raises the issue: does the chest burster come flying out only when the plot deems it so?', ""It's a shame they ruined the Alien movie franchise with this third installment. The direction and photography is good (David Fincher), but everything else is pretty awful. Killing all the characters from Aliens, even Ripley, kills the movie for me. The first two had amazing characters, this movie replaces them with undeveloped, bland prisoners whose main contribution is to beef up the language rating and serve as cannon fodder for the alien. The only characters that stand out are killed off too early. And what's the point of this story anyhow? The plot is much like the plot of the first movie, the scenes with the alien are not scary and there is no suspense, thanks to the lack of characters the audience cares about.Overall this movie was a major disappointment, it not only failed to live up to the high standards of its predecessors, but it paved the way for a further decline of this once promising franchise."", 'Great direction.  David Fincher\'s first film, and he did quite well considering, but the script was 100% awful, a piece of crap from beginning to end.  It completely ruins its predecessor, ""Aliens,"" and was clearly only made to make a quick buck.Fun to watch, but this movie is not a sequel.  It\'s like an interesting nightmare Ripley had on her way to... wherever.', 'Although not quite as bad as most critics thought, this was a pretty bad movie.  It looked great.  All the cool camera angles, and style shots were very good.  However, the story really sucked.  I usually like Weaver.  She is a very good actress.  But, in this one, she just seemed to sleep through the movie.If you want to see a GOOD Alien movie, see the second one, Aliens.  If you want to see a good David Fincher movie, see either Se7en or Fight Club. Both are much better.', ""You really do have to feel sorry for Ms Ripley";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I didn't see it at release, because I was far under the age demographic at that time, but I managed to catch up to the film at around 2011-2012. Not sure the exact year, but I was a teenager at the time, and I loved the Matrix (still do), and heard that V for Vendetta was written by the Wachowskis, so I thought I'd give it a shot.It blew me away in many ways, and I credit the film as being part of the reason I became less homophobic and bigoted in many ways. It was the first time I saw homosexuality in a direct and positive light in the media, and it helped me immensely in establishing my more left-leaning views in the Christian world I was raised in.It's for this reason I have a very deep and personal relationship with this film, but I love the film at a more enjoyable level as well. This film oozes with style. Everything from the cinematography and sound design, to the ways characters speak and act. The rather sparse use of fight scenes (in comparison to other action films of its ilk), opting rather to use political thriller tropes and character development, surprised me the first time I watched it, but even though the film wasn't as action packed as films like The Matrix or Equilibrium (both of which have massive third act spectacles) the action I feel is much more effective and emotional than either of those films (ironic, since Equilibrium is about emotion). While short, the final fight scene between V and Creedy's men is an incredible burst of ecstatic visceral action that makes the entire film worth it.You can say there are three main characters in this film. There's V, the titular anarchist vigilante, Evey, the young woman who is kidnapped, and slowly falls for V in a more violent twist of Beauty and the Beast, and there's Detective Finch, a government employee tasked to finding and unmasking V, and during this task discovering that his beloved government isn't as noble as it may seem. Each of these characters is given a fair and due amount of screen time, and they each have a full and satisfactory character arc. I find how well written and edited this film is to be incredibly impressive, and writing this I want to watch the film all over again just to appreciate it more.There is something to be said, however, about the differences between the film and the original graphic novel written by Alan Moore. I haven't read the original comic, but judging by Alan Moore's distaste of films inspired by his work, and the fact that he refused to watch the film after reading the script, maybe this film isn't for fans of the original work. There's a great comparison video by CineFix on Youtube comparing the film to the novel, and they are very very different from each other. One notable difference is that the portrayal of V vs the dictator Sutler is much more nuanced and less Black and white in the novel than in the film, and that is a very well deserved critique of the film.

Even back when it came out it did so pretty quietly and was thus buried under other big budget flicks. Rarely though does a comedy keep you entertained and laughing throughout pretty much the entire film. Most comedies try and fail, or take breaks from the humor with someone else to preserve material. But Ferrell and Wahlberg play off of eachother perfectly in this film and have real chemistry to keep the film quality high. This is also one of the mostquotable films ever. 9 years later and my dad and I still shoot off a ""I\'m a peacock captain, you gotta let me fly"", or a ""if I were a lion and you were a tuna I\'d swim out to the middle of the ocean and freakin eat you"" every once in a short while. I definitely recommend this movie for fans of comedy', ""I don't normally write reviews but after reading some of the awful reviews some people wrote about this film I had to come to its defence.This film had me laughing from start to finish. If you like the silliness of Will Ferrell films or the humour in Ted then you will love this film. The comedy can be played very deadpan despite the surrealness (is that a word) of the situation. The comic timing is great and the chemistry between all the main characters is excellent. When I saw this film only had a 6.7 IMDb rating I was a little reluctant to watch it but I saw the trailer and that drew me in. I didn't regret it.If you want some great laughs, watch this film."", ""The movie is funny to start and rolls along nicely but quickly loses all steam and finishes quite weak. Having every single character be an off center borderline nutjob loses something without any straight men to set them up or play off of. Mark Wahlberg played the straight man part well for the first half of the movie but turns as loony as everyone else before it's over. A few laugh out loud moments save the entire experience but it really could've and should've been a better film in general and certainly funnier across the board.Not nearly as bad as Step Brothers but not half as good as Anchorman. Probably Semi-Pro and Jackie Moon levels here."", 'Honestly, I came to this movie expecting A LOT. I got more than I expected in the first half of the movie, honestly, Wahlberg and Ferrell did extremely well in that half. Ferrell especially made me laugh hysterically, while Wahlberg was averagely good. Just that half of the movie makes it very good. It explained everything well, made me laugh so much and had funny and interesting twists and turns.The second half (rather, the fourth quarter) is kind of boring. As soon as Ferrell loses his ""loser"" personality introduced in the first half, it becomes average funny but nothing interesting in it more than a Comedy flick - like ""Burn After Reading"", although the comedy was not bad, it wasn\'t enough.Here\'s my final word: Watch it. You will love it and the movie will stick in your head for a lot of time. I liked it, many people liked it. But beware, at the last quarter of the movie, it gets kinda boring. With all that said, the finale was hilarious as well as the credits.', 'What a strange experience. I was laughing out loud in the first minutes and kept laughing during the first thirty or forty minutes -- a rarity in a comedy film for me. The characters are great, the comedy superb, I was thrilled to be watching this gem.And then it sort of died. It was like the writers ran out of good jokes and the movie felt uncomfortable, stale, and tiresome. Very very strange.You want some great laughs to make you feel really good? Watch the first part of this movie! When it stops being funny, stop the film and imagine it will end the way you think it will and be satisfied with that.First part of film: 9/10.\nSecond part of film: 3/10.', 'I typically only take the trouble to go watch a movie if it has an IMDb rating of greater than 7 out of 10 and fits my genre preferences. So when I saw a 7.1, I was expecting a fairly decent comedy out of two seasoned actors. However, the movie fails on a number of counts:1. Parts of the script play out like a broken tape recorder i.e. mind- numbing repetition of the same lines and similar jokes. It\'s as if the script writer got permission to put only 10 funny lines in a comedy movie and tried to squeeze every last drop of humor out of them. Constant references to TLC, Wahlberg\'s ""I\'m a peacock"" line, the constant portrayal of Will Ferrell as a paper-pushing dork etc. made me feel like my mind was turning to mush as the movie progressed. 2. They weren\'t kidding when they rated it PG-13 for ""crude ...language"". The movie is overwrought with misogynistic comments and jokes. It literally reminded me of being in school watching a bunch of prepubescent guys belt out one liners like:""I didn\'t know they sold tampons on wheels"" (referring to the Red Prius that Will Ferrell drives), or, ""I feel like i\'m sitting inside a v****a"" (referring to the Prius again).Orgy loving hobos, a grandma passing sexually explicit messages between her daughter and son-in-law etc etc etc. The list is long and I could go on all day. They really overdid it on that count. 3. The plot is weak and devoid of details. It looks like the filmmakers were hoping that no one would care about the story or central theme with the ""in-your-face"" ""comedy"". Ferrell and Wahlberg are paper pushing cops (for feeble reasons that are revealed in the movie, and really not worth my time to list) who accidentally stumble into a case far larger than either of them imagined. Contrary to what the plot summary says, nobody wants a part of this case, and the only reason they get into it is because Ershon forgets to file for scaffolding permits for a few buildings he owns. Their investigation ruffles a few feathers and everything goes downhill from there. All of this while these two mismatched cops try to ""find themselves"", resolve their differences, and fill the shoes of the two knuckle headed ""red-bull high"" macho cops who randomly jump off a building at the beginning of the movie. Throw in a few car chases, bullets flying willy-nilly, and a stupid wooden gun that Will Ferrell totes around (which is supposed to be soooooo funny for some reason), and that\'s the summary of this movie for you. Don\'t waste your time with this one, unless.... actually, don\'t waste your time on this movie, period.', ""The Other Guys is an incredibly funny comedy that's gleefully stupid and over the top as well as effectively playing with the conventions of buddy cop movies. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are perfect together and have perfect chemistry. Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson are ridiculously funny together in their brief scenes. Michael Keaton and Steve Coogan are both great. It's consistently funny with plenty of hilarious moments throughout. It's also extremely well paced. Adam McKay's direction is excellent and the action scenes are surprisingly well filmed. The soundtrack is really good."", ""One of the worst, if not the worst movie I had the forgettable experience of actually paying to go see. I don't know what everyone here is smoking, but has to be good, because this movie was as lame as a day at the doctors office. First, the plot. We've seen it so many times, it's gotten to the point of insanity. Two cops, one the straight edge, the other the wild man are teamed up and miraculously solve a crime that has confounded top investigative for years. Not only is the plot terrible (something about a ponzi scheme looting the NYPD pension fund, *yawn*) boring but this movie commits the cardinal sin of movie comedies: IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY! The jokes get old 5 minutes in. The running gag about how beautiful Will Ferrel's wife is and him not appreciating it wasn't funny the first time, and was even less so the fifth time! The two main characters have zero chemistry, and Mark Wahlberg is really annoying in this movie. The supporting cast tries, but they can't do much with this terrible script. I was hoping Michael Keaton would steal the show as the duo's boss, but it wasn't meant to be. The best part is, is that the scriptwriters of this dud and the executive who greenlit this project will be hailed as heroes in Hollywood. That says it all!"", 'The sax parts replicating something between a film noir atmosphere and detective b-movie from the 80s are really hilarious. just for those moments it deserves all the praise.\nperceive it more like a social critique rather than a comedy. it makes much more sense that way.', 'This comedy is golden! Almost every scene had me cracking up! My friends and I still constantly drop funny quotes from this movie to this day. AHHH ITS SO HILARIOUS! This is Ferrell and Marky Mark at their best! Do not hesitate to turn this one on', ""Just enjoy it for what it is . Ridiculous!It does make you wonder sometimes is this trying to be serious or is it a comedy?No. It's just ridiculous. But fun."", 'This has got to be one of the most layered and fantastic comedy films ever made', 'Honestly, don\'t take this movie too serious, as you\'ll find yourself, not enjoying it. It\'s one of the those good popcorn fun, films. The Other Guys is one of the funniest buddy cop movies, I ever saw. Directed by Adam McKay, this action comedy really did work, because it lampoons and satire the Buddy Cop clichés to pieces. The Other Guys focus on two New York City police detectives Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) whom been office pencil pushers for years. When the station\'s two tops cops P.K Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) & Chris Danson (Dwayne \'The Rock\' Johnson), catastrophic met their end. The two are forced to step up and go after a giant corporate embezzlement case. I have to say, this is one of Will Ferrell\'s best roles. He wasn\'t annoying, or over the top. I think, when he\'s playing the character, with the deadpan straight-laced delivery. It\'s the best. Yes, he was bit abusive to his wife, (Eva Mendes), but it was play off as laughs. It was too disturbing, not to chuckle. I love how cool and collected, he was for the most part. I love the running gag about him, holding a wooden gun, and his misadventures with \'Dirty Mike and the boys\'. Mark Walberg\'s character is bit bitter & whinny, but the character development, however, does help make him, likable by the end of the movie. Plus, most of his whinny complains were pretty funny. I love his lion eating tuna and peacock needing to fly, speech. Dwayne the Rock Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson\'s roles, while short was pretty damn entertaining. Steve Coogan is just as funny as the main cast as the supporting character, corrupt multi-billionaire David Ershon. He\'s so disarming and charming that he\'s hard not to like. I even like Bed, Baths and Beyond, Captain Mauch (Michael Keaton) who plays a mellow out Police Chief. I love Eva Mendes as Gamble\'s wife. She is stunning and beautiful. Wish, they had more of her in the film. I can do without Rob Riggie as Martin and Damon Wayans Jr as Fosse. They really don\'t bring anything to the table. The movie was less funny, when they were around. The movie has a lot of dumb jokes that was mostly a hit for me. Still, the movie was able to be smart enough to be taken serious. The whole Ponzi scheme plot was pretty interested. I like how the end credits are accompanied by with a series of visual displays of the magnitudes, methods, and principal actors of various licit and illicit financial doings of the financial crisis, such as the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme, Goldman Sachs, AIG or the Troubled Asset Relief Program. A lot of good information, that people need to know. There is an outtake between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg at the restaurant plays after the end credits. Without spoiling it, the ending of the unrated version is just over the top though. The unrated version is just not as funny as the normal movie. Some of the movie was brilliant shot. I love the jump to the bushes scenes, and all the bullet time. Most of all, I love the drinking montage. What an unusual version. Instead, of than a time-compression montage, there\'s a fake continuous shot in which the camera weaves through the slow-mo antics going on over the course of the evening at the bar. It was pretty damn impressed. The action scenes were pretty cool to watch. I love all the shootouts and car chases. It was funny, when the store explore, and how the characters react to it. I didn\'t mind all the product placements in the film. After all, this movie did introduced me to the musical, \'Jersey Boys\' which was awesome. Great use of establish songs, ranging from Foo Fighters \'My Hero"" to Black Eyes Peas \'Imma Be\'. I also love the TLC references as a running gag. My favorite is Rage against the Machine in the end credits. I like all the celebs cameos in the film, ranging from Derek Jeter to Brooke Shields. Overall: This peacock sure can fly. It really was a good time film.You\'ve seen the good guys and the bad guys, now go see \'The Other Guys\'', '""Saturday Night Live"" comedian Will Ferrell has made a mint out of playing morons. He delivers another hilarious performance as a moronic New York Police Department detective in ""Talladega Nights"" director Adam McKay\'s ""The Other Guys,"" an ambitious but half-baked parody of slam-bang police thrillers. Oscar nominated actor Mark Wahlberg of ""The Departed"" co-stars as Ferrell\'s pugnacious NYPD partner. Unfortunately, Wahlberg displays none of Ferrell\'s comic genius. Nothing Wahlberg does registers as remotely amusing. He is either screaming at Ferrell out of spite or skewering his partner\'s masculinity. Wahlberg appears to be channeling Joe Pesci from the Martin Scorsese classics ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino."" Alas, Wahlberg is no Pesci. The funniest thing next to Ferrell is the non-stop ridicule reserved for our hero\'s red Prius. One cop calls it a \'tampon on wheels.\' Surprisingly, the car is far funnier than Wahlberg. McKay and ""Land of the Lost"" scenarist Chris Henchy struggle with little success to combine a formulaic police buddy picture comedy with a complex white-collar crime conspiracy involving a shady investment banker. Think of ""The Other Guys"" as a mediocre ""Police Academy"" wannabe with half of the laughs. Primarily, the humor grows out of the irony that a couple of pencil-pushing desk jockeys replace two loose-cannon celebrity crime busters as the top cops in the Big Apple. The stunt work is terrific. The opening gag where a heroic pair of testosterone-driven cops crash their sports car into a double-decker bus to arrest several shooters for a misdemeanor amount of narcotics is impressive. Alas, McKay and Henchy make some poor narrative choices. First, they kill off the two most charismatic characters, Highsmith and Danson, and then struggle to replace them with two boring morons.NYPD Detectives P.K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Pulp Fiction"") and Christopher Danson (Dwayne \'The Rock\' Johnson of ""The Tooth Fairy"") are a macho pair of ""Lethal Weapon"" cops who refuse to let details complicate their roguish antics. Although they make spectacular arrests, they also create spectacular property damage. Nevertheless, everybody loves them so they can flout the rules. As ""The Other Guys"" opens, Highsmith and Danson are in hot pursuit of a gang armed with assault rifles. Danson has jumped atop their Escalade, but he doesn\'t stick around long after they perforate the roof. Danson dives back onto Highsmith\'s car, bounds off the hood onto the roof, and slings himself back into the front passenger seat. The villains blast Highsmith\'s car so the hood flies back against the windshield and blinds them. Highsmith shoots off the hood hinge. Too late! He plows into a double-decker bus as the villains appear to get away. Danson commandeers the double-decker bus with Highsmith\'s car still stuck in it. Danson careens after the hoods, whips the double-decker around and the maneuver launches Highsmith\'s car at the hoods with Highsmith blasting away with two pistols. After Highsmith and Danson receive their medals, Precinct Captain Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton of ""Batman"") solicits somebody to complete their paper work. These two cops have never wasted their time with paperwork. Detective Allen Gamble snaps at the opportunity to polish off the Highsmith and Danson paperwork. Not long afterward, Highsmith and Danson leap to their deaths when trying to thwart a team of acrobats who wield a wrecking ball to smash their way into a jewelry store and heist $79-thousand in stones. Nobody knows why Highsmith and Danson jumped from 20 stories up and hit the cement hard.A milquetoast forensic accountant who prefers to file paperwork, Gamble (Will Ferrell of ""Old School"") likes to hum the S.W.A.T. theme and stay in the precinct office rather than nab bad guys on the streets. His idea of busting loose is to floor the gas pedal of his Prius and play the Little River Band. Allen\'s partner, Detective Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg of ""Date Night""), is just the opposite. Terry dreams of making the big bust. He suspects drug deals behind every crime. Sadly, Terry has been confined to a desk and stuck with Allen. The skeleton in Terry\'s closet is he accidentally shot New York Yankees baseball slugger Derek Jeter in the leg during the seventh game of the World Series. Yes, the Yankees lost! Everybody in the precinct now calls Terry \'the Yankee Clipper.\' Naturally, Terry hates Allen, but he lives by the venerable ""partner\'s code"" which requires a partner to back up his partner no matter what the circumstance. Ironically, Allen\'s obsession with paper work prompts them to arrest British investment banker Sir David Ershon (Steve Coogan of ""Tropic Thunder"") who is up to his chin in a grand scheme to steal $32-billion from the NYPD Pension Fund to cover the loses of another Wall Street titan.The best scene between Ferrell and Wahlberg is the lion-versus-the-tuna tale. Terry tells Allen that if he were a lion he would rip him to shreds as easily as a lion could a tuna. Terry destroys the lack of logic in Terry\'s threat with own flawed logic. He claims that the tuna would gang up on the lion. Later they would construct an oxygen apparatus to allow them to live out of water so they could stalk and attack lions on dry land. The running joke throughout ""The Other Guys"" is nerdy Allen is a babe magnet. Sexy chicks come on to him and ignore Terry. Terry is floored when he meets Allen\'s hot chick wife, Dr. Shelia Gamble (Eva Mendez of ""Training Day""), who is crazy about her husband. ""The Other Guys"" swerves erratically between scenes of Allen and Terry bonding to the chaos they create after they arrest Ershon. The ""Grand Theft Auto"" chases, the blazing gunfights, and the audacious wrecking ball jewelry heist look cool but these scenes seem out of place in this lackluster buddy comedy. Ultimately, ""The Other Guys"" runs out of both momentum and laughs long before it runs out of plot.', 'Funny enough to watch all the way through without getting bored. Not a work of art but lots of laughs.', ""Saw some reviews saying this movie was Hilarious. I like a comedy but the whole thing just seemed to be a very long advertisement for a Toyota Prius. It started OK, but then the same dry humour seemed to repeat itself. I suppose seeing about 20 people leave the cinema before the movie ended made me understand it was not just me that found it extremely boring. Maybe this is a cultural thing and people in the states like this type of comedy, in Ireland the whole thing just seemed pathetic. I can't understand how Mark Wahlberg made it to play in a comedy. Script bad... Just because you see Samuel L. Jackson on the list of actors does not mean he is in the movie (5 mins .. not much)""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It doesn\'t matter what their reason is for doing what they do. They have determined they are on ""a mission from God."" Belushi was such a genius, though a troubled performer. Aykroyd was not nearly so gifted but played a very nice straight man to Belushi\'s insanity. We are slipping away from an era that provided us with some of the most memorable comedians we will ever see.

The most fun is living vicariously through them as they stick it to the police and other authority figures and evade the consequences. Blues fans will rave over the fantastic soundtrack full of classic blues tunes from the biggest stars.

It was funny and bombastic...John Belushi was fantastic and carried the show and random acts of violence from Carrie Fisher added to it.', ""I love John Belushi. I love Dan Akroyd. So these two put together should have made an explosive movie. What happened instead? The 2 actors played the whole movie with sunglasses and had only one expression: being cool. Get lost!

I can't stand the site of these 2 actors that never crack a joke and are never funny because they are too busy having that cool look. What a waist of talent.In this movie everything is detached. There is no amalgam between the scenes, as if the movie was just many clips put together. The DVD is quite bad. Bad colors and bad light. I will remember John Belushi for all his movies except this one."", ""My high school music teacher screened this for class all those years ago, and it's one I can watch over and over for sure.

True the plot is pretty skimpy, but there is so much that compensates. The Blues Brothers is beautifully filmed, is confidently directed once again by John Landis and the script is very funny. Other than the delightful cameos from music legends such as Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway and James Brown, the Pinto scene with the fall from the sky and the spectacular car chase(ludicrous I know but spectacular too) with the massed forces of the law and order, a country and western band and a bunch of neo-Nazis, what makes The Blues Brothers is the music, it is absolutely brilliant, and the numbers it features in are particularly rousing. And then we have endearing performances from John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and Carrie Fisher as well. In conclusion, people may argue that it is a mess plot wise, but I am past caring really with the music and performances as good as they are. 10/10 Bethany Cox"", 'I admit that the main reason this movie is so good is because of how literally real it is. When it shows them destroying the shopping mall, that is an actual shopping mall that\'s being destroyed. I remember learning about it on Wikipedia\'s list of unusual articles. It\'s the Dixie Square Mall which was abandoned before finally being demolished in 2012. All the car pileups that appear are real as well. You have to admire a film that goes that far for the sake of a joke.Apart from that, I really did find myself caring for these characters and couldn\'t help but be engrossed at how cool they were. I love that this is such an all star cast. It makes me miss Carrie Fisher, but I\'m glad to know her for roles other than ""Star Wars"". Tons of real life musicians appear. It\'s the awesome music and choreography that\'s a big part of what makes this movie so good. I love the random explosions. ***1/2', ""Way over produced and exaggerated, this overrated Movie has a number or funny bits and some bouncy Music, some of it by real Soul and R&B greats, but it is also filled with so many car crashes that it wrecks the momentum. There could easily be 45 minutes cut in the form of unnecessary big budget, obligatory scenes and this would be a more enjoyable Musical/Comedy. As it is, there is so much that is disjointed and destructive that it literally collapses onto itself with over indulgence and unrestrained tomfoolery.Worth a view for the better parts, but be prepared to endure endless repetition, mostly of the vehicular nature. Aykroyd and Belushi were naturals on SNL and other projects, but this big production didn't do them any favors in the creative department because they were buried in so much rubble."", 'Were it not for the pathetic provincialism of movie-goers from Chicago, this awful movie would rate about a 3 or 4 at most. The premise is rather lame, especially given that Belushi and Aykroyd are terrible singers--two white guys calling themselves ""the Blues Brothers"" is an insult to any real blues singers! The movie\'s plot is slap-dash, seemingly thrown together to exploit a throw-away sketch from SNL. This movie started the long trend of bad movies based on throw-away sketches from SNL. I realize it is meant as a live-action cartoon, but so many seams are left showing that suspending one\'s disbelief becomes a chore. Many people love this film because they can\'t watch it objectively. They see only their favorite comic actors from the past. It\'s like that Top 40 hit you loved from high school that just embarrasses you now when you hear it. I saw it when it first came out, and it was over-hyped then and hasn\'t aged well at all. Most professional movie critics see _The Blues Brothers_ for what it is: a mediocre star vehicle that crashes like an old Chicago police car flying out of lower Wacker Drive.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But for now these types of roles are right up her alley. The film has a great pace to it, and develops the characters well, including the new ones.

There's no doubt that Brown and Cavill kill it, but everything else struggles to keep up. If you have a middle schooler, it is a great intro to classic mysteries...but if you want a truly classic mystery, the BBC's Sherlock is a much better option. (Also, if we're ranking the Holmes adaptations, it is far from the bottom. And far from the top, as well.) As for the endings? Yikes."", ""About on par with the original, which I suppose is the minimum you want from a sequel.I have similar thoughts about 'Enola Holmes 2' as I do for 'Enola Holmes'. Millie Bobby Brown is a strong lead, the support cast are good but the plot still isn't the most entertaining to watch unfold onscreen. I'm not sure it needed to be told over 2hrs, either.Still, I got the required amount of entertainment from it. I appreciate the message and the story it tells, as well as them (seeming to, to me anyway) toning down the fourth-wall breaking - which is a tad overdone in the 2020 flick.It seems likely that we'll be getting more of these, which I'm cool with - if the main cast remain, that is."", ""A flame haired girl has vanished disappeared, there's only one sleuth who is free and volunteers, to find out where she might have gone, if foul play has done her wrong, and doused her fire, caused to expire, as some have feared.Lots of chasing, with fraught pacing then ensues, as Enola sparks the wick of Grail's fuse, Sherlock dances a solution, helps resolve his own confusion, but it's a cunning and deceptive type of ruse.An entertaining piece that strikes a chord, as lucifers are snuffed to great reward, with some history thrown in, the end is bound to make you grin, since you have the right, you might as well join in!As engaging and delightful as ever."", ""Love how this movie is based off true events. I was actually researching the matchgirls earlier this year so it was a pleasant surprise to find that Enola Holmes 2 was partly based off this. It's just great how they intertwine historical content into a engaging mystery narrative.In all honesty, I still believe that the first Enola Holmes is better than this one. But this is not to say it is not worth a watch. I love the style (is that what you would call it??) of this film, and of course the actresses/actors are great.Also, apparently Enola Holmes is based off a book, but I have not yet read it so cannot comment on its likeness."", ""I really enjoyed this sequel. They took every thing good about the first film, and turned up the dial. For a avrege sherlock holmes enjoyed, this film is full of fun to be had. The story, like the first film, giving a nice prospective for real world events, and sums them up quite nicely. The acting in this film is great, and aspecialy Henry Cavil's, who stole the show every moment he was on screen. One small flaw that annoyed me was that unlike thw first one, whitch clearly had kids in mind, this one has quite a few scenes, which might be considerd too gory for the younger audience, while still having quite a few jokes and moment that seem to he targeted and smaller children."", 'While the first film was all about finding herself, ""Enola Holmes 2"" is a straight detective story, with Enola following in the footsteps of her famous older brother yet carving her own path and honing her young super-sleuthing skills. She\'s still smart, perceptive, and fiercely independent. And she still routinely breaks the fourth wall to offer us some hilarious commentary or sometimes just to get things off her chest. This is where Brown\'s performance really shines. Her ability to shuffle between comedy and drama is impressive. And she\'s able to retain Enola\'s playfulness from the first film while also showing some meaningful growth. Brown fully embodies her character. She carries the movie with her effervescent style, and the other actors follow suit.Highly engaging, clever and well written script, wonderful costumes, really great character development carrying over from first movie .I thoroughly enjoyed this caper.', ""Oh god where do I start... firstly I'm embarrassed as a woman that this stupid film tries to re write history! All the women a heroic, physically strong, fearless, stand up to 'oppression' and win. There's a dramatic finish, yuk. Fiction re written to suit identity politics and critical race theory! All the white men are evil, the police are corrupt, of course they are! Moriaty was a woman, of course! I fear that there might be a third film in the making. I expect it was just be an all female film, with the odd man, here and there, with a big white board hung around their neck saying 'sorry'. Henry Caville was wasted in this film. He said thank you to some woman at the end and it really was an apology! I'm even sure that the real Sarah Chapman would have also been flabbergasted by the whole nonsense."", ""A really good, enjoyable sequel. A great original story, very well acted by all involved, well written and I enjoyed the puzzles and trying to piece it all together along with Enola and Sherlock. This Enola Holmes series would make a great Sunday afternoons family viewing, as a lover of the Sherlock Holmes books and stories this has fulfilled a desire for new adaptations and Holmes tales. The way Enola Holmes is depicted within these adaptations is brilliant and should be a source of inspiration to young women and girls everywhere, this sequel in particular I'll be showing to my almost teenage daughter. I sincerely hope a 3rd movie will happen somewhere down the line and that's not something I can say very often about movie series."", ""When I read the intro I was sure I was going to hate this film, but it was actually quite entertaining. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece in the slightest, but it was fun, and sometimes that's all you need. The story is nothing too special, but the buildup to the conclusion was nicely executed in my opinion. I like Millie as Enola as well, you can tell she is enjoying herself and that adds to the character. I'd say it is perfect for a family evening.Apparently, this review is too short, so enjoy this extra bit of worthless space filling nonsense I had to come up with until IMBD was satisfied."", ""I will never understand why Hollywood feels the need to replace well known characters with opposite genders or races or whatever.Why not create new characters and empower them to be whatever you want them to be?It takes away any thing you try to gain by adding strong female character or minorities when they are just repurposed versions of male or white characters. It feels as if it was done in a patronizing way.Just create new characters.The movie itself was decent. And there was no need to make Moriarty anyone other than who they already are. Also since this series is supposed to be about Enola Holmes the villain shouldn't have been Moriarty anyway. And should have featured less Sherlock Holmes.And the mid credit scene did the same thing with Watson. We didn't need Watson in this. And we didn't need to change him either.You could have a great new series with Enola and all new characters. Just have a strong story and good acting."", 'As we know netflix has this tendency of ""wokism""... they changed many thing that we know from original Sherlock Holmes story and it just bother me while watching. Too much diversity nonsense with beloved characters.Sceenplay has too many loopholes. Like that prision escaping scene. Fight scenes between men and women is shown such a way that it seems unbelievable and illogical. Cops coming out of nowhere and catching the girls.And most cliche and nonsense scene was that industry scene where girls were raising voice for revolution. Girl gave a big speech and nobody cares and start doing their work but a little girl tapped the floor heavily and suddenly all girls started doing same. And comes the most funny part other girls now gets motivated and joined the revolution. Lol speech didn\'t work a freaking tapping floor worked.P. S.

This time she investigates a disappearance and that becomes quickly quite an adventure. Millie Bobby Brown is perfect as Elona Holmes. In this sequel she again talks directly to the audience and that has its charms. Her looks and vocabulary makes it all very entertaining to watch. There's not much time to rest in this story, constant action is the key of this success. Henry Cavill is definitely better than Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes. The chemistry between the siblings is cute. Their detective work looks so simple, too simple at times, but it's all okay for this genre of movies, an entertaining popcorn movie.

I loved the twist on Moriarty, I loved the continuing romance, and I really overall enjoy the styling of this franchise.

In response, the U.S. president asks his old gamer pals to battle the invaders.....I'm one of those rare people who actually like the work of Adam Sandler. Sure, he's made a few Mis-steps in the past couple of years, but despite the fact that he has garnered an unbelievable amount of haters, his films always have at least one bonkers moment.So it's no surprise that this movie would fail, because people would be embarrassed to like the movie, because all the hipsters hate them a bit Adam.Well I most not be hip, because this film gave me what I expected, a fun ninety or so minutes, some funny random moments, Kevin James playing the same role he always does, and Dinkledge stealing the film from everyone.Sandler knows what he's doing, he plays the everyday guy who always gets the girl and always saves the day. It's the predictability of his movies and the movies that Happy Madison produce. He's been doing it for twenty years, so why should he do it any different.The film is basically Ghostbusters, but with video game characters we all know and love as the bad guys. That's the film. We travel to Britain where the depiction of the British is I scenes, but so over the top it's hilarious (I'm British, and it's your stereotypical Hollywood depiction that's been done since the seventies).And then it's back and forth fighting the titular villains until the big finale. Apart from the PAC-MAN sequence, there is nothing new here, the jokes are almost a linear part of a Sandler vehicle, slightly sexist, very moronic, but, they still never fail to make me smile.All in all if you are a fan of Sandler, see it, its nowhere near as bad as what the critics and haters are saying, but then again, in some circles, it's not cool to like films that people disregard before even seeing.I'm glad I'm not in those circles, because I'd miss some brainless fun to make me forget about the stresses of the real world.Man up, and admit you liked it really."", ""Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had watched this before and enjoyed it. I did too, though I knew this wasn't gonna be any greats shakes and it wasn't. There were some funny lines at the beginning and some of the video game gags did go a little well. Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, and Michelle Monaghan did well with their roles. When I saw the arcade and all those video games during the 1982 sequence, part of me felt some nostalgia for the times I spent with my brother and his friend playing those games at that kind of place. About the ending sequence taking place one year later: lame. Though really, this was pretty enjoyable so on that note, Pixels is worth a look."", 'Possibly 1 of the worst all-time movies ever made. I know it\'s mainly aimed at the pre-teen group, but still... characters have no identity, jokes - if you can call them that - fall flat, over-acting is put in place of anything remotely funny. Also, the editing seems like it was done by 4 different people on 4 different substances. Scenes start and end abruptly, there\'s never a flow to anything. Just absolutely dreadful. I feel my IQ was just halved. This will undoubtedly be shown in film school one day as ""how NOT to make a movie."" Kudos all around for contributing to the dumbing down of a nation.

That\'s when I thought to myself, ""Man, this is a great movie! Why do the critics have to be so down on it?"" Yes, it has some silliness in it but what can we say, this is an Adam Sandler film. Of course it won\'t be the comedy we most adore. This film is different and deserves a chance on the shelf. When aliens intercept video feeds of classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they attack Earth, using the games as models. Knowing that he must employ a similar strategy, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood pal, former video-game champ and home-theater installer Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of old-school arcade players and a military specialist (Michelle Monaghan) in an all-out battle to save the planet.', 'Pixels was a movie I was optimistic about seeing. Then I saw it. The first of a few problems is the actors. Adam sandler is a good actor in this, but his character is bad, the female and the nerd dude are forgettable, Kevin James and Peter dinklage are awful (Acting and characters), and the rest of the cast is irrelevant. The plot loses cohesion as the movie progresses, and it is not explained how dinklage cheated on both the arcades and in the pac-man battle, and the aliens somehow know eddie cheated. The last and most glaring problem is major anachronisms throughout the film. As well as Madonna, Samantha Fox, Daryll Hills, John Oates, and Max Headroom all being relevant AFTER 1982, when the capsule was stated to have been launched, many games are also improperly shown. Arkanoid (Taj Mahal, it\'s not Breakout, as that was only on the Atari 2600 and 5200), The duck hunt dog, Paperboy, and tetris were all after 1982 (Duck hunt was released first in the 1970\'s, but the dog did not appear until 1984 on the NES). The only positive is the pixel effect. Though technically voxels, it still looks very nice.

Why would you hate on a movie like this? Especially if you're my age and remember all these classic games.\nThe cameos were outstanding, and I didn't expect it to win any Oscars. Man, some people need to lighten up. Was Ghostbusters trashed like this?"", ""Having been a teenager/20s person in the 80s, I was VERY familiar with all the games used in this film so I thought it was great fun. I suppose though, that if one has no history with these games, it may not be so for everyone - but the special effects were VERY well done and the acting was just fine. Yes, even Adam Sandler. Although it's true that some of the jokes fell flat that can be said of many, many films, so I won't hold that against it.

But ignore all the critics and the hate that goes along with them, and go see one of the funnest films of the summer. The acting isn't great, its a Sandler film, you shouldn't be expecting it to be.

This film is so bad, that I don\'t even know if Rifftrax/MST3K would be able to do anything with it. I believe the reviews on the first two pages of reviews are either fake, or paid for by the studio to desperately try to compensate for how bad this film was trashed by critics and users alike. Notice that almost all of them follow the same pattern of saying things like ""don\'t believe the reviews / don\'t trust the critics / etc."" I\'d be very suspicious of all those reviews. Think about it, how would a film get so universally trashed by critics and fans alike, and then suddenly there are a bunch of recent 10 star reviews--very suspicious. I don\'t always care for critics either, but in this case, they are absolutely right . . . this film stinks big-time.The scene where Sandler\'s love interest is introduced is so flat and predictable, it literally would have been better if Sandler just looked right into the camera and said to the audience: ""is it cool if you all just accept that this is gonna be my love interest in the film, that just happens to also be an adviser to the president? Yes? O.K. so we can skip this scene? Good. Moving on . . .""

Kevin James just gets casually introduced as PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! This scene is so pathetically unbelievable that I couldn\'t even fathom how awful it was.Keep in mind that I was a fan of Sandler\'s earlier work, especially Wedding Singer, SNL, and even up to 50 First Dates, when he actually still tried and made an effort. He literally didn\'t even lift a finger\'s worth of effort in this atrocity. He doesn\'t even pretend to try anymore. Also keep in mind that I did like the initial concept of the 80\'s time capsule being found and the games brought to life as weapons.I believe that Sandler and crew (i.e. James, et al) simply just decide where they want their next group paid vacation / party to be: New York, London, African Safari (i.e. Blended), etc. etc., have someone write a really cheap, undeveloped excuse for a plot/script, plug in actors from their crew and or friends/relatives of theirs they want to give a shot at stardom, and go on their group vacation / party while kinda/sorta making a movie at the same time.Dinklage makes an effort, but the writers make his character so stupid and one dimensional that it is almost a miracle that he was able to do anything with it.The only other actor who makes an effort in this film is Josh Gad, and he has the only genuinely funny scene in the movie where he gets to give a bunch of Navy Seals the ""Drill Sergeant"" treatment.Other than that 45 seconds, this film is pathetic.

In my opinion it was far from perfect though not terrible.I have loved the Hunger Games franchise but this film let me down. For much of the film it reminded me of Frodo\'s (boring) journey to destroy the ring except that Frodo actually does get there in the End. Katniss sets off to kill the president and spends most of the film trying to get there but then doesn\'t, in fact she is beaten by the resistance, who managed to get through all of those traps that she could not and still get there quicker. She then wakes up to find the war is over. The twist at the end is so well signposted that it doesn\'t take much inferring leaving the happy ever after.Special effects and infinite arrow archery skills ultimately don\'t make up for the lack of story and obvious plot holes. I cannot fault any of the actors, they did the best they could with a bad script.', ""I just saw the movie last night and I've gotta say it was an epic end. Really emotional and has a strong theme. I was reading through some reviews and saw people who say it was rushed and I don't know what they were talking about. How is a story divided in two 2 hour parts in any way rushed? If anything it was dragged out. One thing I found a bit off though was how most deaths were completely bloodless, which wasn't the case in the books at all. It did keep true to the book for the most part which is always good when making adaptations. The beginning started pretty much where the last film ended. The ending was satisfying and bittersweet and did not disappoint. Probably both the darkest and the most epic of all Hunger Games films. Overall it's a great movie and epic end to the franchise. I recommend it for all Hunger Games fans."", ""The franchise started with such promise but seemed to lessen with each film. In this one, the journey towards President Snow was laboured and repetitive. Character development was paint by numbers to non existent. Films 3 and 4 might have been more impactful if retained in one film. But we get the ending... that's something."", ""Well this is it. This was the movie I wanted an entire year to see Part 2 for. Let me tell you, it didn't disappoint, not really, at least.The entirety of Part 2 does follow the book very well. So, if you've read the book, you shouldn't be disappointed with that at least. But, even though it was full of action for a 2 and a half hour movie (that's right, 2 and a half hours) there were parts of the movie where you just went, 'Alright, let's just get this train rolling please' and when it does get going, it goes and goes. The last 45 minutes of the movie are extremely rushed. EXTREMELY RUSHED. There is no time for grieving, there is no time to ponder what just happened, there's no time for anything. It just jumps from one thing straight to the next.Let's pull away from that for a second. There are a couple try hard one liner funny moments they decided to put in. I did chuckle at one of them but the other ones were just not needed. They were not needed at all, it's not meant to be a comedy, I don't know why the writers put them in.You do get to see Philip Seymour one last time (from his death last year), which is a nice thing, especially if you're one of his fans. I do wish Effie was in it more. She was my favorite character in the entire movie. So here's the summary: .It's a very long movie, but it keeps you interested throughout. .The ending is very, VERY rushed. Don't expect time to go over and ponder anything that happens. .Hopefully, the characters you like are along the lines of Katniss and Peta. Cuz the others aren't in it much, sorry. .It follows the plot of the book to a T. If you're a reader, you'll enjoy it.All in all, a decent conclusion to a great series. I just wish it was a bit better."", 'Personally, I actually enjoy the Hunger Games series. The first three films were amazing, or at least satisfying, and with that in mind, I had huge expectations for the finale. Due to the split of the Mockingjay into two films, I believed that this one would be packed with pure ingenuity, and a lot of action, and that all the talking and introductions would have already gone to the previous film.Unfortunately, this was not the case. As much as I hate to say it, I was disappointed with Part 2 of the Mockingjay, for a couple of reasons.The first of those reasons is just, plain, excess talking. Continuous talking to drag the film along. There is no depth to what the characters are talking about, and it\'s just plain tedious and boring. As far as the film goes, it\'s just action, then talking, then action, then talking. Rinse, and repeat. Although some parts might have been fairly memorable, or even slightly necessary, most of the talk is inessential.Another issue with the film is the slow pacing it had. The talking contributed with the pacing, and it took roughly 45 minutes in the movie to actually be able to see any action scenes at all. To drag on the film, an unnecessary story about the use of propaganda was made, leaving viewers highly uninterested and wondering about when the Part 2 would pick itself up, and enter into the story of war. As though that wasn\'t enough, drama enters the film drastically, allowing many of the scenes to be filled with emotional outbreaks, making the film more depressing than it should be. These emotional outbreaks, and the overall pacing of the action scenes did more harm than it did good, as it ends up losing the audience\'s attention through the unintentional scattering of the scenes between drama and action.The final thing that griped me was how the ending was stretched further than it should be. For fans of the franchise that have read the books, the ending was definitely performed well, and brought the text up to the screen. However, it was made to be highly predictable, and as a result of that, it lost its effectiveness and impact to the story. The epilogue, which was approximately another 23 minutes added to the film, was extremely dull, and stretched the film more than what it could have been. Although I understand the need of showing the viewers the relationship between Peeta and Katniss after the events on Panem, it could have been made shorter, and slightly more entertaining.Overall, the film, although not the best in the franchise, was exhilarating and fun to watch. The actors/actresses truly gave it their all, and that itself gave an extra bonus to the film. This film is definitely a mandatory viewing for all citizens of Panem, and for the fans of the Hunger Games.""Nothing can prepare you for the end.""', ""The final chapter of the Hunger Games was an enjoyable one. Flawed yes, but entertaining and gripping. Definitely an upgrade from part 1, which was lackluster. The one thing that makes Hunger Games so great, is the hunger games. The fight for survival. That's what was missing from the previous one. We do not get one as straight forward here, but it is done in its own way which works perfect for the movie. The action- scene in the sewers is dead right terrifying, but bad*ss.The one thing that especially appealed to me was the broken down relationship between Peeta and Katniss. To see Peeta struggle as hard as he did and their dynamic together, helping each other was very rewarding to watch. I must say, this won me over to Team-Peeta.The story-telling was quite inconsistent compared to the first two movies, which in my opinion were superior. The movie was very long, which I did not mind, but it was not as fluid as it could have been. I loved the themes this one addressed in the sense of overthrowing a leader and replacing (him) with a new one and the struggles it poses. Mankind is destructive.The acting all-in-all was continuously solid all round. But PS Hoffman stands out. As he should. It was a worthy performance and a lovely tribute to send him off was present if you catch it."", ""this movie was great and I'm terribly sad to see the series ended because jlaw was an amazing actor... however their were some parts mainly the first 30minutes of the movie i was falling asleep. there was no real action to focus on. But the one thing I was happy about the series was that it correlated with books I definitely recommend everyone to watch the movie and judge for themselves. There were scenes that really made you sad and tugged on your heartstrings. But hey if you read the books you knew that certain thing was unavoidable Anyways, movies were amazing books were amazing. and i truly wish there were more books after this but there aren't. I think president snow is amazing even though he is clearly cruel. one thing i got to say for you if you are to watch the movies... May the odds be ever in your favor"", 'This movie has one major problem: it\'s based on a book millions can recite verbatim, and those folks would get extremely upset - and dive straight to the Internet to express their disgust - if the movie weren\'t as close to the book as it\'s possible to get. So...that\'s what they made.The end result is a movie with far too little of Katniss shooting Peacekeepers and way too much strategizing, deep existential conversation, and attempts to convince Peeta not to eat Katniss\' face, that took all of its predecessor and half this one to actually start moving. Unfortunately for the book, those of us who haven\'t read the trilogy would much rather have had shot-up Peacekeepers.The movie isn\'t a total loss. The fight scenes are fun. It\'s just that there are so few of them! If they could have made a movie ""inspired"" by the book with about half the talking and twice the battle scenes Suzanne Collins put in her book, it would have been a more entertaining show.', 'I watched the first two installments of HG during a long flight. They were OK as light entertainment even for somebody like me, outside the target audience. Obviously I did not read the novel (nor have I any interest in reading it) but I just wanted to see how the story ends.Both Mockingjay parts were on TV lately. Predictably, they provided the awful ending of yet another trilogy, (stretched into four movies, for monetary reasons). This movie was particularly bad for the awful script that skipped all the dramatic key moments in favor of padding with fight, explosions and CGI.Katniss is in a resistance team known as the Star Squad, composed of Gale, Peeta and other disposable members. She secretly plans to kill evil president Snow, thus dragging her team into the most dangerous zone of the Capitol and getting almost everybody killed.Three quarters of this very long movie are just Kat and team fighting and slowly advancing in the city. Some team members die, more fighting and more casualties etc... Finally, Kat gets close enough to Snow\'s palace and her plan is just walking in with other refugees, wearing no disguise whatsoever - brilliant!However, the palace gets bombed and Kat knocked out, just after having caught a glimpse of her sister. When Kat wakes up the was is over and the sister is dead. So the two most important events of the movie take place off screen, while the time on screen is filled by silly fighting....After a minute of conversation with Snow, held captive before his execution, Kat is convinced that president Coin is corrupted and must be eliminated, which she does. She moves back to her District with Peeta, they have children and live happily ever after - because Gale knew that the bombing was planned by Coin, so he was also evil, or something to that effect. Even the ""triangle"" part of the plot was disposed off with a line of dialogue and 20 second on screen...', 'I am a Muslim belly dancer and I love watching movies in free time. This is my first comment on IMDb. The Hunger Games:Mocking Jay Part 2 is an interesting sequel to part 1. It is the story of a strong woman rebel Katnis Everdeen fighting against a dictator president. The film is entertaining with action.When you see this movie you will feel with rebels who have been oppressed and you will come to the feeling that evil doers and dictators will sooner or later get destroyed as a result of their wickedness.This movie has been achieving international success in every country of the world. It is a film for people who love justice and democracy.Me and my dear son Muhammad enjoyed this excellent movie and we definitely advise you to see because it is a perfect epic movie.', ""It's finally over! This is a series of films that I enjoyed but I never loved as much as many other people did. I remember watching the first film and enjoying it well enough but I was surprised when it became this big phenomenon. I have a similar feeling to the last movie in the series that I did to the first one. I liked it but I'm not going to write home about it or anything like that. Besides, this film, like its predecessors, has some flaws that keep them from being among the best movies ever made. Francis Lawrence has once again returned with this film so if you liked the others you'll probably enjoy this one. Let's talk about the conclusion to the story.Wow, Katniss Everdeen's (Jennifer Lawrence) life really sucks right now. One of her former flames, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), has been brainwashed to kill her and the rebels are about to make their final march on the capital. Katniss is still being used mostly for war propaganda but decides that she will end the war herself by personally infiltrating the Capital of Panem and assassinate President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Easier said than done thanks to the Capital's defenses. However, she soon finds out that war is rarely as black and white as her propaganda movies make it appear.The acting has always been decent in these films and everyone has definitely improved on their characters since the first movie. It's interesting to see how these characters have grown throughout the series. Jennifer Lawrence returns as the brave and surprisingly good public speaker, Katniss Everdeen. What can I say? Lawrence is great and she does a fantastic job once again. Her character has come a long way but she's still able to judge people pretty well and find the best course of action. Hutcherson's Peeta has changed a bit in this movie since he was brainwashed during the events of the last one. Hutcherson does a pretty good job showing us the much more damaged and self-loathing character that he's become. Liam Hemsworth also returns as Katniss's other love interest, Gale. Gale is still trying to do the right thing by Katniss and her family but he does seem a bit more bloodthirsty this time around. I guess having your friends die in a firestorm will do that to a guy. I would be remiss not to mention the talents of Woody Harrelson, Julianne Moore, and Donald Sutherland in this movie. Harrelson's Haymitch is still the voice of reason in many situations but we don't really see his character a whole lot this time around. Moore's Alma Coin is fleshed out much more in this film, which was nice, but a little telegraphed also. I mean, who didn't see that coming? Finally, Donald Sutherland as the ridiculously evil President Snow. This is one of those villains that I love to hate. Sutherland himself is grade A talent and he's easily one of the best parts about the entire series and he certainly doesn't disappoint this time around.I actually liked a lot about this movie even though I didn't think it was as good as the first two. The traps in the capital give us action that's similar to the first two movies but the change in location and circumstance makes it feel very different. The scenes in the sewers are especially tense and some of the best action scenes in the entire series. There's also a lot going on with these characters with family members and friends dying as well as this incredibly awkward love triangle going on. They've adapted the books very closely which is nice to a degree but it doesn't work quite as well in film. There are some things we should really be shown rather than told but most of the drama is still well done. It just drags a bit during some parts of the movie. It's also interesting that we literally didn't see a single scene of the larger war taking place inside the Capital. It makes sense that we follow the Mockingjay's journey to its end but it would have been nice to know how certain characters ended up right outside the gates to Snow's mansion. The actual journey doesn't really have any purpose in the end since the rebel army got to the gates just as fast as she did. However, I suppose the journey was a bit of a metaphorical one as well, something she had to take to learn more about the opposing sides, her friends, and herself.I enjoyed this film and the entire series as a whole but it still never struck me as groundbreaking as many people considered it. Obviously, we have this series and the Twilight films to thank for all the young adult adaptations we get nowadays but I still don't see why people go crazy over The Hunger Games. They're good movies though and I enjoyed seeing the journey through to its end. If you liked the others then I would recommend giving this one a shot.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"['I dont understand the low rating, movie is quick in getting into action, some Fantastic effects, set etc. Good thrill. Reminds me of 70 and 80s movie.Give this one a shot and you will not be disappointed.', 'As a fan of William Eubank\'s 2014 film ""The Signal"" I was pretty excited for this. The Signal offered a lot of thrills and suspense and a twist ending that leaves you gobsmacked.Underwater did not quite live up to the same shock value. Less build-up or development to make much of it float anywhere above mediocre. The setting, scenery, and cinematography and music however is stunning.This is the love child of Alien, Cloverfield, A Quiet Place, The Abyss, Soma, DeepStar Six, HP Lovecraft Etc. But doesn\'t carry as much weight.', ""It may be damning with faint praise, but it's better than I thought it would be. If you love sci-fi/fantasy/action genre films and don't go in expecting a masterpiece, you could have a good time. What it lacks in originality it makes up for in craft. It looks great, has fine actors doing good work, and nice production design. Kristen Stewart shows she has the chops to carry a movie, even without a stellar story, and it delivers enough good action and tension to make up for its shortcomings."", ""Remember three years ago, there was a movie called Life acted by Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal & Rebecca Ferguson? Okay, but instead of venturing into space, let's dive into water. And that's what you get from this movie, just that this is worse from Life. Not that it is bad either.Underwater feels very similar to Life in a way that it keeps the direction all the same. Plus, the lighting will also remind you of the 2017 movie.The storyline goes as these engineers who are looking for resources 7 miles below the ocean are unexpectedly bombarded with floods within their facilities and as time runs out, they must find a way to get back to land without knowing that something is lingering in the dark waiting to devour them. Basic storyline, formulaic one-by-one technique but its spotlight mostly covers on the intense escapade to find their way back to the shore. No worries, it's better than those 47 Meters movies.As everyone is wondering how Stewart performs, her acting here is not bad but not great too. It's acceptable. For a not-so-serious sci-fi film, she pulls this off quite decently. The tension is there, it's always there, and it manages to increase its intensity by styling the camera work and also the lighting effect. It does not rely fully on cheap jump scares.The best thing about Underwater has got to be its starting point. The film does not drag the movie with 30 minutes development before anything starts to occur. It goes straight to its main plot";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, in the era of remakes of the remakes, I'm grateful for every original piece of idea, and let's be honest, the overall plot was rather original.We all can imagine cutting few cliché scenes and dialogues, such as never ending reminders of who's thinking about their kid and such.But it was a nice cinema ride!"", ""I really can't express how much I hated this film. I went in with my brain turned off, expecting a dumb fun disaster film with some crazy fun set pieces. Instead the first hour was a dour slog with uninteresting characters, while the second half was utterly insane (in a bad way).The film's premise is simple. The moon is falling, can Earth surivive? But instead the film decides is going to try to offer a cerebral and complex backstory to the moon for some reason. In a 10 minute exposition dumb, Patrick Wilson learns that humans actually originated from a halo ring, but then ai rose up and took over nanoparticles to kill humans, so the humans made 1000 moons and flew them to different parts of the galaxy??? What?This plot twist is so dumb, immediatley after it happens, Wilson has to re-explain what he just learned to the other characters (and the audience who is clearly baffled).Meanwhile, there's a super dull survival plot on Earth with characters you don't care about. There's one mildly entertaining car chase which lasts 2 minutes tops.I can't describe how bad this film is. The only thing I liked were the cool cgi shots of the moon plummeting to earth and the asteroids.AVOID."", ""This is a fun action ride, with good pacing, decent enough acting and a not particularly serious tone. The plot points range through a whole bunch of fun conspiracy theories and other ideas. This is not hard science fiction obviously, but if you can suspend disbelief for a marvel movie and just enjoy the ride, you can do the same here. You won't be bored."", ""What can I say? Went in with low expectations - but it was BIG, DUMB and fun! Nice special effects, thoroughly amiable, competent performances - the science is rubbish (but c'mon - it's written by the ID4 guy).ALSO - Roland REALLY needs support for his step-father issues. Why does he need to hurt every step-father in his movies?Anyway. It's fine - just don't get hung up on the science."", ""Or give him a screenwriter. This is absolutely the biggest piece of trash yet. Extremely poor writing filled with cliches, trite comments, expected plots and the comic second banana. And the plot???? Gawd!!!!! The moon is hollow???? I spent part of the time. They've resusitated the characters for 2012 and INDEPENDENCE DAY and given them a new plot twist. It was so bad, I almost left halfway thru, (and I got in for free), but I decided to stay because I wanted to match the currect characters with those in the other films. Wait til it shows up on tv in 4 weeks and then for $5.99 groan with the friends and family. This is a stinker - 3 stars is generous!"", ""If you go into this movie expecting anything other than cheesy acting and a preposterous story the you will be sorely disappointed. If you go in with your brain in neutral then you might just have some fun. Halle Berry brings a little gravitas to her role but Patrick Wilson and John Bradley ham it up for all it's worth. The special effects are pretty good and no one does end of the world stuff like Emmerick does. It has something that a lot of other movies lack, s sense of fun. It knows it's audience and never pretends to be anything other than a popcorn flick."", ""Moonfall is every disaster flick you can name rolled into one. Bad dialogue but decent acting it's the special effects that save the movie from being complete garbage. On paper I can see how this movie was greenlit but the execution with the forced sentiments and interactions Moonfall isn't breaking new ground or even reinventing the genre. In order to enjoy this movie you literally need to shut off your brain and enjoy the show."", ""In 2011, astronaut Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson) is able to save a space shuttle mission from an alien swarm.

Conspiracy theorist KC Houseman (John Bradley) discovers that the moon's orbit is deteriorating and headed for earth. He tries to recruit Brian to contact NASA.Director Roland Emmerich has woven a conspiracy theory into his brand of action sci-fi thriller. I like the potential. I even like the outlandish concept. The first half is a little clunky but I'm willing to go with it. The problematic writing does build up over time. It's his never-ending close calls and melodramas. It's the awkward sci-fi. The second half stumbles here and there until it falls flat. Roland is no longer that guy anymore. He's not making the big budget action thriller hits."", ""Made no sense, plot holes you could steer the moon through. Pointless cameos and some surprisingly good acting in places.

The DJ ( we only see her lips) provides the antique chorus and gives the movie an eerie touch.Recommended', ""I am a massive fan of the original warriors, but hated the directors cut. The comic book wipes from scene to scene seemed to cheapen the whole film. Though the director may have been originally aiming for a more 'fantastic' (for lack of a better word) feel, surely he must realise that the way the movie turned out, with a certain gritty and yet, feel good style, is the way it is meant to be. Slapping a few cartoons here and there instead of a simple wipe doesn't make for a radically different movie, just a spoiled one. And why would the original film, a classic and masterpiece, be discontinued once the new edition is released? there are future and even current generations who may not get a chance to see the original now. If the original DVD edition is going to be discontinued, why can't it be included in the new edition, we all know that it is possible (see alien special edition) am i the only one who has this opinion?"", ""Interesting, action-filled, gang-drama.A delegation from a gang, the Warriors, goes to a meeting of all the major gangs in New York. The convener of the meeting, Cyrus, wants to unite all the gangs into one huge crime army. However, he is shot and killed by a disgruntled gang member and the Warriors are blamed. Now they have to fight their way home...Regarded as a bit of cult classic, the Warriors isn't brilliant, but it is quite entertaining. Decent plot - though some of the traps and twists can be spotted a mile off - and good action scenes. Performances aren't bad - the machismo, swagger and, to an extent, overacting are laid on thick but this suits the characters and movie."", 'In a future, dystopian New York City, turf gangs and cops rule the streets. When one gang leader tries to bring all gangs together against the cops, the Warriors are framed for his murder and the entire city turns on them.What could have been a film about gang violence -- and glamorized gang violence at that -- is actually a story about diplomacy. How do the gangs cope with knowing hundreds of other gangs exist in New York City? How do they work together (or fail to work together) to stand their ground against a police force that wants them dead? This film, although fun and action-packed, is really a small-scale look at the world. We have Cyrus, trying to unite the gangs into a sort of United Nations. We have sovereignty and territory disputes, and the choice to defend them by force or negotiate a peaceful way for others to travel through who mean no harm.', ""New York City is at its grimiest in Walter Hill's 1970s film, 'The Warriors'";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It had been one of those movies I had heard about but had never gotten around to. There are times when it seems that Matt Damon is such a cold fish (ala The Good Shepherd), that one has trouble getting connected to him. In this film he is really believable as a man who has all the training of a killing machine, but a soft side that bears exploring. The character is put into situations he can't understand but can only react to. He has compassion but little understanding. What an interesting role. If there's a shortcoming, it's that the motivations of the bad folks aren't all that clear. It's still a delight to watch his relationship with his I-only- need-a-ride partner develop. There is a level of subtlety that most films of this type don't have. The car chases are spectacular but, for once, they backed down on the pyrotechnics. I appreciated this."", 'This story has been done several times in the past, most recently in ""A Long Kiss Goodnight"". It\'s also true that Doug Liman and the producers created their own Jason Bourne mythology,since this movie is different in many ways to the book. But the truth is Liman takes an old story and puts a new fast paced spin on it.Matt Damon stars as the enigmatic assassin who just wants to figure out who he is. As he travels from city to city he\'s followed by CIA agents who want to dispose of him to save their own jobs. He\'s helped along the way by Marie played by the brilliant Franka Potente. Together they come face to face with the people that want them dead.The cast is great and so is the story. This film should be on everyone\'s top ten list.', ""After reading Robert Ludlums excellent book, i was filled with anticipation before watching this movie, especially since Matt Damon is a very talented guy. So what went wrong? - The movie misses most of the plot from the book, and doesn't manage to come up with one on its own. So it ends up a mediocre action movie with no plot but some nice fight scenes. That sums it all up for me. For those of you who have read the books, think of what this movie could have been, and weep."", 'I enjoy the great special effects of movies such as the Star Wars series and other action packed movies such as the Die Hard and James Bond films, but the special effects are just as much a part of the plot and story lines as the writing. It is refreshing to watch a film that does not rely on excessive special effects to tell its story. The Bourne Identity (2002) is one such film. The Bourne Identity stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, a man found shot and lying in the ocean by fisherman who has lost his memory. He struggles to regain his strength on the ship and he tries to piece his life back together. He hits a dead end and finds that he must leave the boat. Bourne has a bank account number that leads him to a safety deposit box filled with money and fake passports. Bourne realizes that he must be a secret agent for some country. He hooks up with Marie, played by Franka Potente. As it turns out, Jason Bourne was a secret agent who was shot because he did not fulfill his mission, to Assassinate Wombasi, an African Leader, played by Adewale Akinnouye-Abaje. There were agents who planned to kill Bourne because he has now been considered a rogue agent. One familiar face, Julia Stiles, plays Nicolette, an agent in an operator type position. There was also the agent played by Clive Owen, the Professor, who was one of the agents sent to hunt Borne down and kill him. Packed with action and suspense this film is wonderfully shot. There were flash cuts in certain action packed parts of the film. Also, during the action there was minimal music playing in the background to add to the realistic feel to the film. I can say that I enjoyed watching a film that did not need to blast techno or other type of music to express the action of the film. The use of less sound made the film enjoyable. You can concentrate on the action on the screen and not worry about who made the song and other things that can be distracting when watching a film. These flash cuts and the use of less music added a dramatic feel to the film because Borne can be a real person, this can happen to any agent who defies the government and choose not to follow orders. They can be hunted down!', ""What if you had lost your memory and learned the CIA is out to terminate you because you know too much? That's the question Matt Damon's super-spy Jason Bourne wants to know and it could cost him his life. In the starring role, Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the charming and lethal secret agent on the hunt to find out who he is. Mastering different martial arts styles and weapons training in addition to several foreign languages, Damon is a force when he takes the screen as Bourne. The film's action is endless as Bourne is chased around Europe by assassins of the secret he is out to discover. From car chases in snowy Germany to hiding out in the lovely European countryside and ending finally in the City of Lights (Paris, France). The film's fight scene are just engrossing as Bourne gains the upper hand each time due to his special combat skills";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There's even reference to Raimi's earlier horror career with buzzing chainsaws and severed limbs in the tense, quirky hospital showdown.The film retains the look, feel and sound of the first, and there's a strong sense of continuity with the return of literally ALL the characters (even Willem Dafoe makes a welcome cameo appearance as the Green Goblin).

Alison's character was that of a teenage girl with an entitled princess attitude, and John's was like a genetically blessed pre-teen who when asked to do something does it like an enthusiastic teen (hey buddy, wash the car please like thing), but nothing else goes behind those two eyes. Venegas character's flair reminded me of Aladeen from The Dictator film. I think the audience for the film was teenagers, and adults who hate teenagers that act like there is no real world consequences and are able to get away from the consequences.

Heartland gave that award to this film.It\'s in 3-D and it\'s gorgeous animation. But what really matters is the story. And it\'s a good one. At first it seems the main story is about a Viking colony equally distant from nowhere, which is being constantly attacked by a wide variety of marauding dragons. It\'s a full time job trying to keep the dragons at bay and the Viking warriors are often out on their boats hunting their wily and ferocious opponents.But really the story is about a father and chief of the Vikings who has a young son, Hiccup, who is small and who is a slick, sarcastic talker and who doesn\'t take orders well, but still seeks respect from his impressive father. At first, his Father will not let his son be a warrior Viking, but later relents to have Hiccup train with the other youngsters. But the young boy gets sidetracked and instead of wanting to kill dragons, the boy befriends them and seeks to understand them.A young and inexperienced son seeking approval of a strong father is an often-told tale. Sons often act foolishly trying to impress their fathers. And fathers often ignore the strivings of their sons. In this case, there is honor and courage on all sides and it is inspiring to watch the father and son wrestle with their relationship.And yes, about the dragons – they ARE ferocious and talented and aggressive warriors. But their motivations are a mystery that unfolds slowly. And that\'s the fun of this film.FYI – There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.', 'This is a great beginning to a remarkable franchise. All viewers will enjoy watching this. I certainly did. The storyline was strong and wild. It held itself throughout the instalment and to the whole franchise. The cast selection was truly spectacular. They really committed and connected to the storyline and to their respective characters.This instalment and franchise reveals to viewers that it is possible for humans and creatures to form a friendship and bring peace to all. I do not have friends. I never have been good with people. It also shows the bravery and courage that anyone can have. This is a great beginning to the franchise that everyone will enjoy.', ""incredible! certainly the front runner for the best animated film of the year. from the first to the last frame this film is as good as an animated film gets on almost every level. beautifully written, designed and executed. though an incredible movie, it's not quite perfection - probably due to time and budget limitations (is there ever enough of either?). that said, the problems i had are far too few to mention. if dragon doesn't absolutely slay at the box office i'll lose faith in middle America. congrats to the filmmakers - you've made a masterpiece and you made me feel like a kid again. thank you."", ""There are a lot of excellent reviews out there, I will just discuss a single point. What got to me the most in this movie is the message I got out of it, I got it from a single line uttered by the hero and it just burned in my memory, it's about how when we look deep in the eyes of our enemies -the ones we fear the most- we will see that they are afraid of us just as we are afraid of them, we might realize their humanity and that they are not what we thought, monsters.This is definitely one of the best 2 animation movies this year, with Toy Story 3 being the other one, tough job for the academy awards this year, and hope this is the case every year.It's nice to see beautiful animation movies challenging Pixar's, it definitely benefits the viewer the most. How to train your dragon - Highly Recommended."", 'There\'s lots of very dynamic exciting action in this movie and it\'s mostly done with a cheerful fun tone most of the time even though there\'s still danger. However, despite that lack of ""realism"", I do think that adults will enjoy it a lot too. The story is not the most original (except for the original premise) but it\'s very well told, with good character development and has a fairly good morale for those into that. The effects and animation is stunning. Very well done.The story was entertaining to watch and it didn\'t really drag on like other animated films. One thing I didn\'t really like, is that there\'s a part of the ending that we\'ve seen a hundred times before especially in kids movies and I would have preferred a little more originality there or at least see it better done because I didn\'t really buy into it. Very clichéd and should have been better in my opinion', 'Hiccup a young Viking befriends Toothless, a young dragon. This is the best movie I\'ve seen since the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Virtually everything about it is wonderful. Rarely have I been so drawn in to an animated movie. The 3D aspects are thrilling and the movie has a great story, amazing animation, non stop action and a positive and constructive message. It made me want to go out and get a pet dragon. This movie is perfect for people of all ages. Now I know what a feel good movie is. This movie will make everyone feel good. Congratulations to all who contributed to this amazing film. It will make toy dragons a popular gift item. Hope to see it again and again. 3D at it\'s best.', 'I liked How to Train Your Dragon, but not as much as everyone else seemed to. Maybe it was just talked up too much. The animation is unique and the characters are interesting, but the story felt flat and I found myself checking the clock at times. This movie entertained me, but not as much as I thought it would.', ""As a movie itself, this is pretty good. But to say that it is based on the book? No. It is not. The only things the film has in common with the book are names and dragons. As a huge fan of the HTTYD series, this film is a real disappointment. I like the books because they view dragons differently. You don't have dragons as the good guys in many stories, but Cressida Cowell makes them into companions of the Vikings. I feel this film completely ruins the point of the books. Because the stories are so different, if/when they come to make a sequel, they will have to make up a completely new storyline. The characters are all wrong which makes it impossible to sympathise with them. Astrid isn't even a character in the books! For any fans of the books, there is no way I would recommend this to them. It destroys all the meaning of Cowell's books.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"['Compared to the first one, this one is a massive dissapointment because the world while trying to expand and add new concepts, it doesnt explain them in a good way and over complicates them, while also not having a story as strong as the first film. But, the movie can still be seen, its entertaining and has really good action scenes which are the things that keep you watching it. So, despite not being as good as the first one, its still entertaining.', ""News reaches Zion of an army of sentinels amassing on the surface many miles above the city, clearly preparing for an invasion. While the city prepares for a counter attack on the sentinels, Morpheus pins his hopes on Neo and obeys orders to stay with broadcast range to allow Neo to meet with the Oracle. Neo meanwhile is plagued with dreams of Trinty's death in the matrix. When the Oracle does contact Neo, she tells him of The KeyMaker - the man who can get him access to the very source of the matrix. A rescue mission is mounted which is complicated by not only the agents, but rogue programmes and the return of a 'freed' Agent Smith.Many reviews (here and in the press) have tended to go one way or the other. Some have lavished praise on this film claiming it as a milestone and even better than the original, others have hated it and laid into it heavily. I'm not wanting to sit on the fence but I do feel that both camps have valid points and that the answer is somewhere in the middle. The main reason I found it hard to get into this film was the heavy tone it has now developed. Seemingly the same bug that the Star Wars movies have caught (taking themselves too seriously) the matrix appears in danger of getting in a bad way. The plot here is quite straightforward and not as twisty as the original - however it is delivered as if every line of dialogue was profound. This really sucks the life out of the film as it is not profound but rather borders on the pretentious at times due to it's delivery.I suspect that this was spotted and so the film is unnecessarily cluttered with minor characters that detract from the central tale. And so screen time is given to Link and his wife as well as a seemingly pointless speech from Merovingian. This makes it feel baggy and also slightly unsatisfactory when these strands appear to go nowhere but only fill time. Also the plot is a little too complex (all this rogue programme stuff) and isn't delivered in a user friendly way - it is not always clear what the significance of certain things are until later in the film and even then it is uneven. However both these criticisms will be countered if, in Revolutions, these strands are brought together and minor characters in Reloaded are shown to have a bigger input.On the plus side the action is very good. I must admit that it wasn't as exciting as the original mainly because the plot wasn't as involving to me - I need a good story generally to get into the action side. However in honesty the action still looks great and is a real leap forward from the Matrix - a great blend of wire work and visual effects. Occasionally the special effects are slightly wanting (in Neo's fight with Agent Smiths it is clear when it is a visual effect rather than the real thing) but these are minor quibbles compared to some sterling work. The car chase on the freeway may be a very easy way to get an action scene but it still works very well and is exciting. The only downside to it is that I felt that an action scene should have been part of the end of the film - instead the 'big' scene occurs a good 20 minutes before the end of the film. The actual cliff-hanger itself doesn't really work and it could have done better with a general downbeat ending like Empire Strikes back had - did it think I needed a reason to watch part 3? I'm already there!The acting suffers from the same problems as the plot - it is all too heavy. The clearest way this is seen is in Fishburne. In part 1 he was very good, especially when he exposed Neo to the matrix with a mix of playful wit and serious touches when they were needed. Here in part 2 he seems to be mistaken that he is playing Othello again. Watch him speaking to the crowds at Zion, he really plays it like he is playing Moses or something. In fact all through the film he is very heavy - even compare his big fight with his previous face-off with Smith in part 1, there he was human and vulnerable here he is more like a rock and less fun for it. Moss is also serious but she was in part 1 too so it's not so noticeable. Reeves is good and at least adds some humour but he plays it very serious again. The additions add colour but are mostly distractions. The support cast in part 1 were merely there, here the film feels it has to develop them to make a rich tapestry but the end result is it feeling too stretched. It's hard not to watch Pinkett-Smith and feel that her character is more to do with the video game than the film itself. Happily Hugo Weaving is fun and is back with his old sneer, while the twins are good value despite having minimal plot impact.Overall it was always going to be hard to follow up the first film. There the plot was gripping and it is difficult to make the growth of Neo's powers as interesting as his discovery of them was. I enjoyed the film but just felt that the almost biblical significance that it tries to give itself was it's undoing - luckily the action and style was it's salvation. Hopefully I will watch Revolutions and see how Reloaded works better in hindsight. Without that knowledge, many of the plot strands appear to be left loose. If I watched this as a film by itself then it would be irritating - if the conclusion to the trilogy can get back to the enjoyment and tone and spectacle of the matrix at it's best then this will be a much better film in company of it's brothers. Far from perfect but I don't see how anyone can totally write this film off."", ""The Matrix Reloaded (2003) is the greatest action movie of all time and a good sequel to the original The Matrix (1999) that I went to see it with my mom in the movie theater in 1999 when the movie come out. I love this movie even if some people are saying is not that good I still love it and love The Matrix Revolutions as well. It is one of my personal favorite Keanue Reeves movies.Granted things get bigger and a little darker. The visual effects, go way overboard and the CGI does not bleed in well with the live action. Nonetheless Reloaded is a fun film to watch. The visual aspects blows out of the water. The soundtracks to this movie are pretty good and they are fine of mix songs to the movie.The sequel to successful original movie is an awesome film. Not just a visual wonder but the ambitious storytelling that demands more than your average action film. A wonderful follow up to the outstanding original and a great precursor to the inevitable finale. While it doesn't strictly adhere to normal flow of most films, that is one of its best traits. While it has its flaws, it makes for a fantastically entertaining experience. Not for those who don't want to think too much.It is a good sequel who doesn't deserve to be hated for it. Keanu Reeves and all other cast crew did outstanding performance on their works. Nearly 12 years later have passed since no movie has come close to tapping into the myth, world and action that was created in Matrix Reloaded. For fans of action movies, the story can be as straight forward as you wish it to be, following the path of Neo as man kinds savior. For those who wish to dive deeper, you can see how far the rabbit whole really goes because the amount of hidden references, back plots and information in this movie is immense. For a film The Matrix fans this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The CGI effects creating more Smiths were astonish, were cutting-edge for the time, and still look great (whoever said differently below is simply incorrect) -- even if they're completely commonplace today. Insane action ensues as a well done plot follows.Neo (Keanu Reeves) saving Trinity on the end of the film and than he collapses in to come was awesome and great ending with a cliffhanger so that viewer keeps guessing what will happened next, in the next movie that was just great. The Neo vs Smith fight is just excellent as is the Freeway chase. More Smiths (Hugo Weaving) I think Hugo Weaving did a perfect job as Agent Smith in this follow up sequel. I love his character and I think he is one of the best villains ever. Neo vs a 1000 Smiths fight scene just blew me away/ the martial arts were outstanding action sequences. Overall it is a good film at least it is for me. I will never understand the hate for the sequels for it. At the same time, the complexity of the storyline, and the unexpected plot twists left many viewers a little (or a lot!) confused. We'll admit that it's taken several viewings for us to figure some things out, and that there are still lots of pieces we haven't put into place. Some answers, we're sure, will not be revealed until Revolutions, and some will never be revealed. There are no words for Hugo Weaving except badass!Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, and the rest of their crew continue to battle the machines that have enslaved the human race in the Matrix. Now, more humans are waking up out of the matrix and attempting to live in the real world. As their numbers grow, the battle moves to Zion, the last real-world city and center of human resistance. That is the basic main plot and it is good so I am giving 9/10 for been a good action movie. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies."", 'Of all the big-budget sci-fi sequels that are winging their way across our cinema screens in 2003, the two MATRIX sequels are amongst the most highly regarded.

As the characters have grown older, the story line gets better, and I was hoping the same would go for the sixth movie. However, I am still completely confused about the decisions made for this movie. The movie is two and a half hours of ridiculousness. Yes, it has fantastic effects, and humor about the raging hormones, but who cares if the integrity of the story is completely diminished. Let's make a list of everything they cut out:1. The introduction of the new Minister of Magic and all that happens between him and Harry. 2. Dumbledore coming to the Dursley's house to give them a piece of his mind. 3. Harry, Ron and Hermione seeing Draco in the dress shop, and Harry getting his first idea that Draco had been branded into the Death Eaters. 4. The invisibility cloak was absent in almost every important scene besides the train. 5. Slughorn's parties (the first of which that was on the train when Ginny gets her first invite.) 6. Tonks finding Harry on the train. 7. Tonks and Lupin's relationship 8. Several key memories that help Harry find the horcruxes in the 7th book. Also the awkward arguments between Dumbledore and Harry about Dumbledore's whereabouts and what happened to his hand. 9. Hagrid and Thwarp10. Harry finding out that everything that Sirius owned now belongs to him (including the house that serves as the hiding place in the 7th book) 11. Several of the Quidditch matches and how Harry ends up in trouble and has to miss the final match. THIS is when Harry and Ginny have their first kiss when she becomes the seeker for the team and helps the team win. 12. Harry and Ginny's relationship 13.Fleur and Bill's engagement, and are completely absent in the movie. 13. Madam Rosmerta's role 14. Moaning Myrtle's role 15. THE FIGHT IN THE CASTLE!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME! The best part of the book and they cut it out. They deserved to be fired in my opinion. How could Rowling sign off on them doing this!? 16. Dumbledore's funeral17. Harry telling Ginny he could no longer see her...they couldn't have this scene considering they never showed them to be in a relationship.I'm sure there is a lot more, but you get the idea. All of these scenes were cut to add those that never even happened in the book. If you are an actual fan of the book, be prepared to be disappointed. If you haven't read the book, I'm sure it'll be great."", ""The reason I gave this an 8 is because it is truly a sensational film, the best yet out of the whole franchise. The acting is milestones ahead of what it has been in previous HP films (especially from Emma Watson), the storyline and characters are much more layered and 3D, the sets and special effects are breathtaking, and the score is absolutely gorgeous. As a stand-alone film, I would happily give this a 10.BUT, of course, it is not a stand-alone film - it is the follow up of many other films, and is also based on a book so rich and layered that it could not possibly compete. While this is (IMO) the best film so far, it is also the most unlike the book, and if you know the book and what follows in the Deathly Hallows, you can't help but notice gaping holes in the plot where crucial information has been left out. This film features only 2 of Dumbledore's collected memories - the book shows quite a few more, some of which are important in Harry's hunt for the horcruxes and may have to be dumped somewhere unfitting in the next two films, just to get them out the way (for example, the memory featuring Hepsibar Smith and Hufflepuff's cup). Also, fans of the book will no doubt notice that some of their favourite scenes have been taken out: the funeral at the end, the aftermath of the final Quidditch match (the involvement of Quidditch in this film was entertaining, but seemed pointless as it lead to nothing), and most importantly the battle at Hogwarts between the Death Eaters and The Order/Dumbledore's Army. What I'm trying to say is, if you have not read the book you will probably be able to enjoy this film for the beautiful and intense piece of work it really is - but unfortunately, if you have read the book then the comparisons will come flying at you from the very start, whether you like it or not, and there are definitely more here than there have been in previous instalments.Half-Blood Prince is definitely the darkest of the books, and this has proved to be the darkest film - the ever present sense of tension or even impending doom is hair-raising, and every scene featuring Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) had me almost breathless, even if he does look about 30 now. He is definitely one of the best actors of the HP films. There are also some painfully tear jerking moments throughout: including a surprise attack on the Burrow, which was heartbreaking, and the scene in the cave where Harry has to force the liquid down Dumbledore's throat - that is the first time, in any film since he started, that I've really appreciated Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, which I imagine will be the same for many of you.In short, definitely a must see - but book fans must accept that the films have taken their own turn now, and I imagine that the changes in this one will lead to some very major differences in the two Deathly Hallows instalments. The films could never be the masterpieces that the books are, but this one sure comes close....mischief managed."", 'HP6 is a dark and emotionally thrilling masterpiece. It combines magical awes that appeal mostly to children as well as mature and dark themes that appeal to almost everyone. It discovers the dark and mysterious past of you-know-who and leaves the audience aching for more as its two and half hours run time go by in a flash. The film contains dazzling visuals and terrific cinematography. It is indeed a satisfying experience that will please just about everyone. One thing is for certain though: in resemblance to the Rowling novels, the film series seems to get darker and more mature with every passing film while keeping an incredible PG rating (in the exception of HP4 & 5). This film not only has some bangs and booms but also explores the theme of teenage love as the three protagonists find themselves tangled in teenage romances. Overall a top notch film worth seeing over and over. Cant wait for the arrival of the Deathly Hallows.', ""This film has possibly the worst ending of any HP film, and wandered the furthest from the books. If you are a fan of the books, this is for you: Remember that cool battle at Hogwart's at the end of the book? It's not here. None of it.Remember the important plot setup with the tiara? Not here.Remember all the background and memories about Tom Riddle? Not here.Remember Bill Weasley? Not here.Remember Bill getting wounded by a certain werewolf? Not here.Remember Fleur? Not here.Remember Snape's important parting words to Harry? Not here.Remember the funeral? Not here.Remember the touching conversation Harry had with Ginny at the end? Not here.Remember Scrimgeour? Not here.Remember the Burrow burning down? No? Oh, because that IS here.In short, this film is great if all you took out of the book was the romance and funny bits. If you're more invested in the bigger story, you'll be disappointed."", ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009) follows Harry as he learns more about Voldemort's dark past in order to finally defeat him. This film really sets up the final films well and has a high level of tension, the atmosphere is incredibly moody!The film has some really impressive visual effects and some subtle yet impactful cinematography. The quidditch scenes look genuinely realistic! The cinematography reflects the gritty feel of the film, and the lighting is as impressive as always! I like the use of long shots to build up tension and there is also some really good framing. The use of colour is a stand-out in this film, the green tint in the flashbacks was extremely effective, and the black-and-white grading gave the film a depressing and dark feel.At first I wasn't really a fan of the score for this one, however it gets better as the film goes on! It helps to build up the tension and set quite an ominous and immersive atmosphere. In addition, the sound design is equally as great and you can tell a lot of effort went into it!The film really takes the time to focus on the characters and their development, which I REALLY like. It adds a lot of interesting lore to Tom Riddle's backstory, and develops the romance between Ron and Hermione well. Ron has a lot of funny lines too, and is highly under-appreciated in this film! By far my favourite character in this film is Draco, Tom Felton's performance is flawless! The mystery surrounding his character is so effective and I love the dark turn the filmmakers take for his character. Draco is highly manipulated by the death eaters and it's heartbreaking to see, but just proves how great the writing is.This film is fairly slow, but very engaging and still a fun watch! I feel like it balances a lot of sub-plots VERY well and this is impressive! It adds to the lore of horcruxes which is great exposition for the next films! Also, this film is incredibly emotional, Dumbledore's death is so unexpected and the whole scene is shot so well!"", ""This movie focuses on the relationships too much and not the actual story. There was more of Tom Riddle's backstory in the book and in the film, they could've focused on that instead of the relationships"", ""I'll keep this short and bittersweet. While not without its merits, the sixth film in the HP series was very much a let-down for me.First of all, I'm a die-hard fan of the books, but I absolutely didn't want or expect the movie to follow the book page-for-page. In fact, some of the creative liberty taken in the film was quite good. One scene in particular was very good, where Bellatrix and Fenrir Greyback attack the burrow, leading to a showdown in the marsh between Harry, Ginny and the two Death Eaters. Or at least it had the potential to be very good. In fact, much of the movie was very anticlimactic. That scene, among many other crucial scenes, fizzles out when nothing happens. There is a short duel, and then the DE's leave. The same thing happens in the end of the movie, which was the biggest let-down of all the films so far. The battle through Hogwarts at the end of the book was the big climax, leading up to Dumbledore's death. In the film, the whole battle is cut out, replaced instead by a very short and mawkish scene in which Snape gives a quick Avada Kedavra, and then everyone goes on their way.In short, the lack of appropriate emotional content and the lack of any real climax anywhere throughout the film just makes the whole thing a bit lackluster. Bringing David Yates back into the picture was clearly a costly mistake."", ""As an avid Harry Potter fan who has read the books multiple times and of course seen the movies repeatedly, I was extremely excited to see this movie at the midnight showing. Half-Blood Prince is my favorite book and other than 7, the darkest book in the series.That being said, I was so disgusted with this movie. Yates & company literally turned it into Harry Potter comedy hour. I'm not sure how anyone thought this movie was amazingly dark when the theater was cracking up laughing the entire time at trite jokes. The only thing that should have been funny in this entire movie was Lavender & Won Won's obsession w/ each other.The movie emphasized the unrequited love/snogging/Ron & Lavender romance over the major plot line which was learning about Tom Riddle's background. With the exception of Dumbledore's first meeting w/ Tom & Tom asking about how to make Horcruxes, all of the background was left out. That's essentially three quarters of the book omitted.What was the point of not having Tonks find Harry on the train? How can you have Tonks call Remus sweetie and not explain all the drama between them and how they got together? How can you leave out Madam Rosmerta's involvement? What was the point of the burning of the Burrow scene? The ending was horrific. It was completely different than the book. So now Dumbledore is the only one who can apparate on Hogwarts grounds? Malfoy spends all this time working on this cabinet only to have the Death Eaters walk through, Bellatrix (who is not present in the book) encourage him to kill Dumbledore, Snape kills Dumbledore, and they kindly saunter off the grounds in no hurry. No battle... no fear of being caught...nothing. What was the point of the cabinet in the movie? It was completely anti-climatic and they didn't even have the funeral scene which is a must-have. The worst part ever was the very end...Harry and Hermione are talking about Dumbledore's death and going searching for horcruxes and she randomly chimes in that Ron is OK w/ Ginny and Harry. WHAT?! It was so awkward.And can someone please tell me how they are going to explain Dobby and Kreacher in the Deathly Hallows movies when they have essentially been omitted from the subsequent movies after being introduced? I honestly would like a do-over. They really need to re-shoot this movie and try again because it was bad. For the real fan, it leaves you cold and empty, with no tears for Dumbledore because you are so confused, and wondering why Yates and Co. cared about Lavender being funny more than the back story of Tom Riddle."", ""It's a good thing I like well-made movies, good acting, and relationship stories, but that's not why I go to Harry Potter movies. I started going to the HP films for the wonder and imagination, my favorites are the day to day magic like making dinner, and scenes where the Hogwarts students are learning magic. There was 1 interesting potions scene, no defense against the dark arts, 1 new discovery by Potter, 1 fun cleaning the house scene, no interesting dining hall magic during dinners, and Voldemort is not in this film. It had some comedic scenes, but nothing to make me laugh long enough to miss anything important. The sets were again amazing. I LOVED Fred and George's shop scene. The memory scenes were captivating. The quidditch games were good but not as exciting as earlier films. Hermione's brilliance was completely overlooked. The Half-Blood Prince storyline was skipped, Dumbledore's withering hand storyline was skipped. The ending had a twist but was underwhelming. I would always recommend Harry Potter be viewed on the big screen, some over and over again, but this is one I will not see again until the video comes out."", 'I think people are forgetting that the book is a very complicated one to transcribe to screen, but the film, bearing in mind that it changed the overall structure of the book, missed some very dramatic scenes out, and characters like Rufus Scrimgeur and Rosmerta were left out entirely is definitely the best of the Harry Potter films. The climax was good, but compared to the book\'s climax, which was much more intense, I felt it could have had more action, and perhaps more explanation. Visually, it is a marvel to look at, especially with the Cave Scene with the dark brooding cinematography and the splendid special effects. But somehow Steve Kloves managed to not only make some genuine scares, namely when the arm of one of those grey creatures comes out the water and grabs Harry, (this made me jump violently) but there were some really funny bits. Like when a student is sick in front of Snape, Snape says ""you have just earned yourself a month\'s worth of detentions"", and Ron and Lavender\'s romance. My favourite has to be Harry and Ron\'s hilarious conversation about girls\' skin, and when Dumbledore is seen holding a Woman\'s Own magazine! Not to mention, Luna\'s dress in one scene, what was she wearing? I am just wondering though, whether I was the only one who wept buckets at the end, sorry, seeing Harry crying over Dumbledore\'s body and everyone staring on helplessly, just started me off on an emotional drainage. Back to the film, the music was beautiful and very haunting as well as noticeably darker in tone to the scores by John Williams and Patrick Doyle, and there was some splendid looking scenery. The acting was excellent, Daniel Radcliffe is likable as Harry, Rupert Grint hilarious as Ron and Emma Watson giving her best performance as the character. Robbie Coltrane was good, but it is a shame he didn\'t get that much screen time. I never cared much for Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, Richard Harris was more my idea of the character, but Gambon like Watson gives his best performance (as the character that is). Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were solid as rocks in their roles as Snape and McGonagall, and Tom Felton was remarkably good as Malfoy. Helena Bonham Carter was brilliant as Bellatrix, nobody could play her better. But for me, the scene stealer was Jim Broadbent as Slughorn, maybe not what Rowling intended in terms of figure, but the the performance is wonderfully electric. The direction was competent, overall, the film is no masterpiece, but it is the best of the series, so I thoroughly recommend it. 9/10 Bethany Cox.', 'I am going to have to agree with the review stated by Mr Todd above, and for almost all the same reasons...? The battle for Hogwarts was lame, no battle at all. The \'discovery\' of just who exactly was the Half-Blood Prince was left out and distilled to a single line at the end in the non-existent battle. The memories from the pensieve were distilled to almost nothing. The memories of Lily and James Potter along with Snape and their time at Hogwarts were left out. The entire memory of Tom Riddles past was left out. Kreature and Dobby were entirely absent.How are we to feel sorry for the tragedy that is supposed to occur in the following two movies that comprise the seventh book..? There was no character development here, and almost all of the characters whose deaths we are supposed to feel were wooden with no depth and no emotional attachment.That being said, the actors and director did well with what was obviously a screenplay written by someone who had very little knowledge of the series, and did not bother to educate themselves on the finer points. The screenwriter/scriptwriters should have been fired and replaced.This movie has been, by far, one of the biggest let downs I have ever had the misfortune to witness. By comparison, ""Twilight"" was a tour-de-force.', 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince flat out sucks! It has very little redeeming factors to it, its too long and its boring. I will never understand how the filmmakers turned what was actually an okay book into a film this boring. I read the Half-Blood Prince book, and I actually liked it. I liked the dark turn the books had taken (before f*****g it up with the Deathly Hallows), and the death of Dumbledore was actually dramatic and actually elicited an emotional response from me. It wasn\'t a great book, I felt that the plot delved a bit too deep into the relationships amongst the characters (or was that the Order of the Phoenix? Either way it slowed things down), and I also didn\'t really find the book that exciting until the ending, that is where things got good. The movie, on the other hand, was the complete opposite. Things did not get good towards the end, if anything, it got worse! The Half-Blood Prince is what happens when a book that had so much background to it that when turned into a film, the filmmakers need to keep things moving while still telling a good story and have it exciting. This movie didn\'t do that at all. It was boring, from beginning to end, nothing but boring, dreadfully slow scenes that nearly put me to sleep. Not only that, but the many scenes regarding the relationships were so bad that I didn\'t feel that the characters didn\'t actually like each other, the only reason they do is because the plot requires them too. For example: Ginny Weasley is supposedly going to be Harry Potter\'s girlfriend, but her character is so bland and the actress didn\'t really do a good enough job to make it look like she actually did like Harry. She stares at him with an uninterested look in her eyes, one that says to me, ""Why does the script require me to fall for this guy?"" Its painful to watch, and only serves to kill 5 minutes.The rest of the cast is hit-or-miss. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, as always, is brilliant. He is the one cool character and I don\'t think it is because he is well written. It\'s because it\'s Alan Rickman! He is always fun to watch on screen! Whether it is Galaxy Quest, or...any of the other Harry Potter films, Alan Rickman always does a great job. However the rest of the cast is nothing spectacular. I already mentioned how bland Ginny Weasley is so I won\'t talk about her again, but everyone in this movie just doesn\'t work. Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange is so over the top that she comes off as hilarious! I know she is meant to be psychotic and all that good stuff, but...look at her! Her character isn\'t subtle at all! She cackles and laughs manically whenever she is on screen and I found her more annoying and funny rather than frightening. The cast of this movie may have good actors/actresses lined up, but it\'s ultimately the characters that fall flat. They either are completely useless, or so obviously evil that whenever someone thinks they are not one of the death eaters I feel like shaking them relentlessly shouting, ""HELLO! HOW STUPID ARE YOU!? Look at this guy! He has no nose, no hair, no visible human traits aside from the fact he looks somewhat human!"" In case you didn\'t know, I was talking about the evil lord snake-face, I mean, Voldemort.Onto the plot, and trust me, this is where I REALLY started to loathe this film. It does so much yet succeeds at doing nothing at all. I watched this movie in a trance, trying to remember what happened and why. After some time I eventually just gave up, mainly because when I asked myself, ""Why,"" I realized that there was no reason why. Nothing happens in this movie! It was so boring that I almost couldn\'t believe it. What are they doing now? Oh, absolutely nothing. What now? Oh, they are trying to find this item for reasons I forgot about and didn\'t really care about in the first place. Why is this drink that Dumbledore is drinking making him progressively weaker? Why are there zombie-like creatures rising up from the water? What is going on? What are those things, why should I care? The answer to the last question is I shouldn\'t. Only hardcore Potter fans will truly know what is going on, the rest of us is left confused, or was that just me? What\'s going on now? Oh, the death eaters have invaded Hogwarts, oh no! That should be dramatic, but it really isn\'t. What just happened, oh wait, Draco Malfoy couldn\'t grow a pair and kill Dumbledore, he just stood there crying like a little b**** until the only cool character had to do the deed himself. This was the worst insult of all, Dumbledoofus\' death wasn\'t dramatic, period. It happened, was incredibly boring, and went, and that was it.This is a movie that I just love to hate. I take great joy in ripping this movie to shreds because I feel that I must have revenge. Revenge against having a series of once okay books turned into movies that started off well, then turned to c***. It pains me to see a franchise that I actually once liked (contrary to my review of the Deathly Hallows Part 1 movie) be turned into this. The problem is that while I did like the franchise initially, it\'s the awful conclusion and the awful recent movies that turned me against Harry Potter. I wanted to like this movie, I really did, but, sadly, the movie failed. Harry Potter, I hate to say this, but you failed!', 'This is the review of my favorite book of the Harry Potter series and unfortunately the weakest movie of the series to date.Spoilers will be present.Much of the focus on this movie is relationships. Snogging and jilted love abounds for the first 2/3 of the movie. Action takes a very small back seat and seems rushed, while any chance to further a emotional moment of jealousy is focused on to the point of boredom. Despite this focus the actual emotional payoff between the characters going through this at the end of the movie is somehow missing.The last 1/3 of the book is an amazing ride of action, tension, and despair. The movies shift to this moment seems very rushed, it is Harry all of the sudden being made aware of hoar cluxes and wisked away to find one in what seems to be within a whole 2 minutes. The scene of getting the ""hoar crux"" from the cave which was explained in great detail in the book was rushed.Probably the worst change from the book, and truly a critical flaw, was that Harry is NOT immobilized by Dumbledore before his fateful confrontation with Malfoy and Snape. In the book Dumbledore knows that Harry would not simply stand by a watch as he is killed, but in the movie this is exactly what he does. He is not immobilized, forced to helplessly watch as Dumbledore is slain. In the book Harry is given no chance to attempt to save Dumbledore, in the movie he has the choice to attempt to save him but chooses not to. This changes the critical scene of the entire book in a huge way. Harry loses complete control at the death of Dumbledore, his enraged attack on the Death Eaters at the moment of his becoming unfrozen, his realization that the breaking of Dumbledore\'s spell means he has died. This is all destroyed via Harry NOT BEING FROZEN.The subsequent battle between Death Eaters and the schools teachers is flat out removed, Snape\'s struggle to remain sane and in control while being called a coward by Harry after his sacrifice he had to make only moments ago. All of this stuff which was critical to the book is flat out gone.For the amount of fluff this movie focused on it is amazing how many critical aspects of the storyline were rushed and I cannot believe the crucial changes to the story that take place from the time Harry and Dumbledore return to Hogwarts until the end of the movie.', 'Oh god.This movie butchered the magic of the book. I seriously wasn\'t sure if this was the same movie... Why didn\'t Dumbledore pick Harry up from the Dursleys and give them a piece of his mind? Where was the Slug Club? Why didn\'t Harry know that Sirius\' house was now his? not to mention Kreacher? It plays a big part in the next movies! Why weren\'t the lessons with Dumbledore fully developed? You find out almost NOTHING about Voldemort\'s past. Where were Bill and Fleur? Where was the twins\' shop? (Blink and you miss it) Where was Hagrid? Where was Neville? Where was Quiditch? Where was Tonks\' and Lupin\'s relationship??? What, am I just supposed to believe that they get married out of nowhere in the next book? Where was Madam Rosmerta\'s role? Where were apparition lessons? How are the trio meant to move from place to place in the next books? Magic Carpet?!?!?! Where was Dumbledore\'s funeral? Where was Harry\'s and Ginny\'s relationship and break-up? Where was Scrimgeour? Where was the big fight at the end? Where was the set up with the diadem? Where was Fenrir Greyback? WHY for the love of all that\'s holy, did Harry just STAND there while Snape murdered Dumbledore before his very eyes? He was meant to be PETRIFIED (literally)!!! And not only that, but Snape actually SEES Harry, and does nothing about it. Won\'t Harry find it kinda odd that a Death Eater sees him, practically defenceless, and doesn\'t do anything about it? Harry is meant to believe that Snape is a full fledged Death Eater, yet he lets Harry get off scott free? That is a SERIOUS oversight in the plot of the book! All these things listed above, the major plot points, weren\'t there! I couldn\'t find them!What I COULD find however was: The burning down of the burrow...?!? Dumbledore seeming to only JUST realize that Voldemort used Horcruxes even though he was meant to have already destroyed one... and not only that but I also explicitly heard Dumbledore say: ""They could be anything""!!! In the book, he clearly points out that they WOULDN\'T be just anything, that Riddle liked collecting things. In the movie, he makes out as if it could be any old thing, a shoe, a can, a piece of paper... (better get searching then Harry, I found the ring, because ""Magic leaves traces"", but when I die, you\'re screwed!!!) Some random waitress in some random diner... A rock concert tribute to Dumbledore... A revealing of Hermione\'s love for Ron... and i DEFINITELY found Ron\'s and Lavender\'s relationship and... sexual innuendo?? OK, the Ron and Lavender subplot in the book was quite nice and funny but in the movie, it completely shadowed the ACTUAL story! they were snogging all over the place! it was impossible to focus on anything else with them popping up everywhere! It turned the movie into some sickly rom-com! and then I was shocked to find sexual innuendo! yup, believe it or not. And i know I wasn\'t the only one because i heard laughs and hoots all around the theater. The scene where Ginny bends down to tie Harry\'s shoelaces... what is up with that? Hey hang on a minute, isn\'t Harry\'s cloak meant to be a hallow? Good thing Luna CHARMED it off him then!!!MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEADSo, not only did they destroy the capodopera that this movie could have been, but they also didn\'t set up the next movie/s. How are Harry, Ron and Hermione going to start looking for the Horcruxes if they don\'t even know what they COULD be? How are the contents of Dumbledore\'s will going to be passed along if Scrimgeour doesn\'t even exist? How is Harry going to remember that Xenophilius was wearing the symbol of the Hallows at the wedding if the WEDDING CAN\'T EXIST??? And HOW is Voldemort going to get the wand from Dumbledore\'s tomb if 1. the TOMB Isn\'t THERE and 2. THE WAND Isn\'t IN THE TOMB ANYWAY!!! How is Harry meant to remember where the diadem was if he NEVER BLOODY SAW IT!!!! How are they going to use Grimmauld Place and Kreacher, not to mention Dobby if there was never even a whisper about what happened to them???This movie was thoroughly disappointing, and I really think they should... remake it basically!!! Because not only was THIS movie bad, but it\'s set to ruin the next ones as well. The only slim ray of hope (because hope springs eternal) left for the next movies is that they include what they missed out in HBP at the start of the first seventh one. They\'ve got like 5 hours for the rest of the Harry Potter story so they could fit it in.', ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Most everything about the movie is different--the characters have definitely matured, Hooper's score is better (thank goodness), the special effects have improved, and even the castle itself has a different feel to it...cold and covered in shadows. It's a refreshing touch, though. The series NEEDS constant change, or else it would become quite stale...There are many funny moments in the movie, and the hormones are definitely raging. But, relationships aside, there is also a darker side to the newest Potter entry. Dumbledore and Harry try to unlock the secret to Voldemort's past. Harry must retrieve a precious memory from a long-lost friend of Dumbledore's (an excellent Broadbent).The last thirty or so minutes are marvelous. In particular, there is a scene in which Harry and Dumbledore must venture into a protected vessel of Voldemort's soul...very creepy, very emotional...it was well-done.Ending is surprising. Quite sad, really. I don't want to spoil anything.But it's a wonderful thing to see how much this series has progressed. Epic is definitely a word that may be used to describe Half-Blood Prince. But I'm even more looking forward to the next two installments a must-see.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

If you want art or some wisdom message or you are searching for holes and sanity in the storyline, forget it. Go and watch some European authors. But if you are looking for fun, want to relax yourself, to see some amazing and very realistic computer effects go and watch it! You will not regret. For true impression big theater screen is mandatory!', ""This Film harkens back to the old 70's Disaster flicks - taking situations and just magnifying them 1000 fold for entertainment sake. Yes, the Science here is questionable (apart from the effects of the currents being disrupted!) - it is all in the service of a storyline. The weather systems across the entire Planet are thrown into chaos by 'climate change' and it is up to Paleo-climatologist Dennis Quaid to convince all that the unthinkable is going to happen - while at the same time trying to re-bond with his estranged son - Jake Gyllenhal. All of this is hardly new but this Film does it with great dash and with a few great set pieces - the inundation of New York is superbly done and the characters are allowed to develop in quite a natural way. Unlike many of Emmerich's film (which I find overblown) this one he approaches in a more serious manner - the opening shots of Antarctica set the scene extremely well and the accompanying score by Harold Kloser is actually very haunting. All in all, an enjoyable film with some very nice performances."", 'A decent filmitasion what could happen because of climate temperature raising.', ""I don't get it why this film just got 6.4, maann the visual effect alone was amazing. The tension is so high especially the new york scene. Maybe the science isnt accurate but I found this film is very entertaining. I watched this when I was 9 or 10 yo, now I'm 24 and this film still my fave disaster movie. The tsunami, tornado etc was perfect. Good job for the writers, director, producer especially the cast."", ""I saw this once and my sister was hiding under a blanket the whole movie. that's not really relevant, but it is funny. hehe.This movie is pretty fun. It has surprisingly good romantic chemistry for its genre, and you really feel the weight of everything that's happening. Super dramatic, not scientifically accurate at all (but who cares really), decently romantic, and attention-grabbing. Like ya want to know what happens next.Not much else to say. Watch it if you like disaster/action stuff. I thought it was a lotta fun. My favorite part is when the boat goes through the thing. haha."", 'I agree with the review I read on IMDB that said the film is cliched and illogical...but the special effects and catastrophe that happens in the first hour make it worth seeing. I also agree with them, however, that the last half just looks like a survival film...like Irwin Allen\'s ""The Poseidon Adventure"" or ""The Towering Inferno"". This is especially because any pretense at making the story plausible seems to have vanished! So, New York City has zero power and has been innundated with walls of water...so why are the cell phones and pay phones STILL working? And, only a couple days after,it\'s so cold and frozen that wolves are running about NYC eating folks?? Huh? It just seemed like after a while, the writers were tossing anything into the mix...and I\'m surprised they didn\'t introduce aliens like the Great Gazoo or Uncle Martin!So, my advice is to go ahead and watch this spectacle film if you\'d like...especially if you have a big screen TV. But don\'t think any of this is well written. It abounds with scientific nonsense and silly, one-dimensional characters doing the most ridiculous things!', ""One of my all favorite time disaster movies! It's got the right mix of over the top weather moments, dramatic storylines, and Dennis Quaid. Endlessly rewatchable and surprisingly heartfelt."", ""-Like how it brings global warming the attention it deserves.\n-The survival tactics were commendable.-I didn't get too attached to the characters, thus there wasn't much suspense."", 'The folks who actually like this movie are the reason Hollywood makes very few quality movies any more. If you don\'t care then why should they? This movie is so bad from the beginning. Numerous tornadoes pummeling a West Coast city and there are actually people flying in helicopters to get a closer look. That\'s a brainy idea. Buildings freezing and crumbling yet the people outside don\'t seem to be affected so much. The ""walk"" from Philadelphia to New York? And in record time no less. I do like the fact that they had the foresight to have Antarctic weather gear handy for just these occasions. What of the tent that was able to withstand the chill but not the Empire State building? Call your local Army Navy store....they really need to stock these tents. I also found it amazing that any lines of communications were not really affected, including the under freezing water pay phone. The only ones who had communications losses were, of course, the main characters.....ah drama!! I know they were in a library but you think they could have possibly tried to burn all the wooden tables and chairs around them? Seems that they would burn warmer and for longer than books. The acting was horrific, the directing was terrible, the script was unbelievably bad and the special effects were anything but special. It certainly rates up there with Godzilla 2000 and Armageddon......it actually makes Independence Day look like one of the all time greats!', '2019 marks the fifteenth anniversary of the release of The Day After Tomorrow. Co-written and directed by Rolland Emmerich in the midst of his being the modern ""master of disaster,"" it was a sizable hit in cinemas and a TV re-run staple. How well has it aged though?One thing that the film has going for it, as does so many of Emmerich\'s films, is its cast. Dennis Quaid\'s casting as paleoclimatologist Jack Hall is something of a foundation for the entire film with Quaid bringing both an everyman quality to the role as well as a sense of intelligence necessary to make him believable as a scientist. The other significant bit of casting is Jake Gyllenhaal who is just about believable as Hall\'s teenage Sam who becomes the audience\'s main in-road to the incredible weather events taking place in the plot. That Gyllenhaal has strong chemistry with his co-stars closer to being the actual age of their characters helps while the handful of scenes early in the film between father and son help establish their relationship as potential loving but slightly estranged. It\'s something that, while invoking cliches perhaps at times, helps anchor the film all the same.It also helps that the rest of the cast is solid. A young Emmy Rossum shines as academic decathlon contestant Laura who becomes a love interest for Sam in the New York portions of the narrative. Though not a sizable role, Sela Ward does well in her brief appearances Dr. Lucy Hall, Jack\'s ex-wife and Sam\'s mom who is trying to care for patients. It\'s also a cast nicely filled with veteran character actors such as Ian Holm in a delightful role as a fellow climate scientist, Kenneth Welsh as the Dick Cheney like Vice President, Dash Mihok as Hall\'s aide Jason, and the ever reliable Jay O. Sanders as Hall\'s longtime colleague Frank Harris. They\'re just the tip of a strong cast, something which even in recent turkeys like White House Down and the Independence Day sequel Emmerich has been good at putting together.It is also, perhaps not surprisingly, a special effect feast. From the still impressive all CGI opening credit sequence to tornados in Los Angeles, a tsunami striking Manhattan, and British Royal Air Force helicopters frozen out of the sky, it is everything that one might ask from an Emmerich film. It\'s also well realized with much of the CGI holding up after all this time with the singular exception of a pack of wolves who even by the standards of the time look unconvincing. Combined with the sound design and music of composer Harald Kloser, the results are still incredible to watch. Of all of Emmerich\'s films, it is perhaps only second to Independence Day in how well its effects hold up.Where the film suffers, as does so much of the director\'s work, is in its script. There are more than a few cliches and thin characterizations at play in the film\'s two-hour running time which are grating at times. More often than not, especially with the Sam and Laura relationship, the film is saved from going too far by the sheer chemistry of the cast. Well, that and well-timed uses of humor to boot. Just how right and wrong the film gets its science too is interesting and has, of course, been discussed far better than I can hope to do so here. Needless to say, as someone who has read the film\'s non-fiction source material (The Coming Global Superstorm by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber), it\'s hard not to find the ideas compelling even if the timetable undergoes sizable, if not implausible, acceleration.Despite some of those issues, The Day After Tomorrow is a film that, even after fifteen years, still plays to all of the director\'s strengths. It\'s a bold, epic tale that takes in a large cast of characters and a worldwide scope. Despite that scope, it\'s principally focused on the United States with glimpses of what is happening elsewhere. It\'s a tale of survival told in as unsensational a style as it can. In short: It\'s the War of the Worlds of the climate change era, doing for it what HG Wells did for alien invasions.Plus, as I write this, it\'s hard not to find the scenes of Americans fleeing into Mexico funny. Heaven forbid if something like what the film portrays actually happens. In that regard, at least, it could well be The Day After Tomorrow...', 'The first time I saw this film was when I was a senior in high school. My English teacher at that time showed it to us. The film was so powerful and powerful that it left an indelible impression on my mind, so much so that I can still recall what I felt and saw then.', ""Maybe a few lulls in the action, not believable at all, but fun, funny, exciting, great special effects and Jake at the top of his game. Seen this many times, own the disc, this is the type of film you go out and buy. When Hollywood can take an outlandish story and make you believe it, they are doing good. What has happened to Hollywood since 2004 ? They ain't makin' em believable anymore !"", ""Not super gripping or suspenseful but just a good all round by the books disaster film, good acting, reasonably entertaining, never boring. I was expecting worse based on everything I've seen and heard about it, but it's a solid watch."", ""Well for me this film wasn't one I was looking forward to, initially when I saw the adverts I thought I wanted to see it, but after reading some blurb about it I was concerned that it was going to turn into the usual Hollywood 'adventure' drivel...Sadly my thoughts came true.I thought the movie started well, all the science seemed to be dealt with in a good and sensible fashion, and you do feel a sense of impending doom. The early disaster effects are typically top notch, although I felt a huge chunk of ice falling on someone's head would have made them bleed! And strangely for a Hollywood movie they didn't depict their administration as being infallible, which made me think maybe I was wrong to prejudge the film.Sadly, things then deteriorate into the typical Hollywood fare. The hero does everything you'd expect, in the way you'd expect. The good old stiff upper lipped Brits perform their background tasks and do the usual (i.e. Die in a research bunker that turns out to have less stocks of the essentials than a New York library (where can I buy a vending machine that provides sustenance for 6 or 7 people and a dog for a week or more?)). When the 'hero' becomes all heroic the major mistakes become evident. We've all touched something ice cold and had our skin stick to it, so surely someone holding onto to frozen metal with blood oozing out of their hands would suffer a similar fate (especially considering how cold it's alleged to be!). They also seem quick to remove their facial protection, without a care in the World.The other thing that makes you go uhmmm is that the temperature at one point is supposedly dropping at a rate of -10 degrees every SECOND, yet it clearly takes the hero, and his son and friends for that matter, well over 10 seconds to get to safety. This despite earlier in the film someone in similar circumstances freezing on the spot in less than 3 seconds! (oh and it was also cold enough to freeze aviation fuel, but obviously American film stars have more in their veins than everyone else!? )The temperature drops so fast that all the windows shatter, uhmm except of course on the building where the stars are! (either that or their room would have literally been snowed under, like the rest of New York!). Added to the fact that their chimney seems to work despite being blocked by snow and ice, surely if they hadn't frozen to death due to having no windows, they'd have choked to death on the smoke flooding their room since it had nowhere to escape to (this can be seen near the end because the hero can't even tell that he's reached his destination, and you certainly can't see any smoke coming from where the chimney should be!).Oh and to cap it all, once the hero finds his son (bet you never thought he'd do it..YAWN!) the sun miraculously appears, as do hundreds of survivors! (can anyone tell me how they'd survived in skyscrapers that had no windows, and had been ravaged by tsunamis earlier int he film!??!)All in all I found myself wishing that it had been an English film, for then some reality may have been preserved.Sadly this film completely loses the plot half way through and all credibility goes out of the window."", ""I have seen this movie so many times in the last 15 years and still relish it for what it is! I really enjoy a lot of the scenes and story. I'm blown out of the water that a bunch of reviews were bashing the script and story, really unfortunate. I got silly thoughts like I'd like to see anyone of you make a movie script lol it's cool though I have fun! Very cool to see the storms and all the smart people gather to talk about everything, I love all of it!"", 'THE DAY AFTER TOMORROWRoland Emmerich\'s roller-coaster ride of Global Warning terror is every bit as over-the-top as you could imagine. From the first previews of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW it was clear the audience was in for a disaster film to end all disaster movies. The destruction of the world as we know it. The problem is, seeing the movie adds little to no emotional weight to the ""ooo\'s"" and ""aaaah\'s"" we experienced when we first got a glimpse of the trailer.THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW takes place on a day when Global Warming strikes the entire Northern Hemisphere. Only a handful of scientists are aware of the oncoming slaughter before hand and as a result half of America is trapped with no place to run from a deadly storm that includes tornadoes, blizzards, floods, hail, and sub-zero temperatures. Stuck in a public library with a few of his friends is Sam Hall (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), the son of leading American climatologist Jack Hall (played by Dennis Quaid). Here\'s the shocker though, they have an estranged father/son relationship and Jack must travel across the frozen wasteland that was once the northern USA to save his son.The main problem with this film is that the emotional center is painfully contrived. Why couldn\'t they have gone against the loop and had the father/son actually be very close? It would have given the film a fresh, less-familiar tone. Every time the film tries to delve into the drama of Jack and Sam\'s relationship I couldn\'t help but roll my eyes. One of my biggest pet peeves with movies is when I can tell the director is trying to make his audience cry, instead of just telling an honest story. Unfortunately, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is filled with scenes like that. To name a few:The scene with Jack in the tent talking about getting to his son. - The random cancer patient Sela Ward has to stay with through the storm (apparently there is only 1 patient who couldn\'t be moved and he just happens to be a 12 year old child?) - The death of Dennis Quaid\'s long-time friendAll of these scenes dragged the film to a screeching halt for me as I had to excuse myself to laugh at the lame-ness.However, what THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW promised to deliver on (crazy action, fantastic effects, overwhelming danger) it succeeds at wildly. The sequences where the storm first approaches are nothing short of phenomenal. Especially the flooding of New York. All of these scenes don\'t even try to ground themselves in reality... they embrace the over-the-top edge to this story. It is these extensive action scenes that manage to keep the film alive despite the tiresome and clichéd story.As usual, Dennis Quaid manages to make more of the material then it deserves. However, Jake Gyllenhaal, though clearly a talented actor today, offers a completely confused performance. Perhaps if Sam were played better, the father/son story would have been more gripping... but as is, Gyllenhaal\'s performance does nothing to help the film. Ironically, I found this to be Emmy Rossum\'s best performance so far (not too challenging considering how unimpressed I was with her in both POSEIDON and PHANTOM OF THE OPERA).Overall, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is more then entertaining enough to pass a few hours. However, it\'s not nearly strong enough a film to stick with it\'s audience more then a few minutes after the credits. It\'s too bad too, b/c a massive blockbuster about Global Warming could have probably been a little bit richer.... C ...', ""This movie is TYPICAL Hollywood. And by that I mean it's all glitz and glamour without any substance. Don't get me wrong\x85 the special effects are great (although weather effects are easy to pull off at this point). But the movie has no point what so ever!!! Whatever little plot there is, is terrible. *Spoilers* OK, basically it goes like this\x85 Big storm comes, and spreads around the world in a matter of days threatening humanity with the 2nd ice age. Storms destroy all the big cities, blah blah blah\x85 Since the movie follows Sam Hall (Jake Gyllenhaal) most of it is set in New York. So NY gets hit with tidal waves, and then it all freezes over and then you have everyone stuck in the NY public library. Not bad so far\x85 but that's it. Jack Hall, Sam's father is some kind of weather expert specializing in Alaska and global warming so he predicts this whole storm. So when he finds out that his son is trapped in NY he WALKS (drives to Philadelphia and then walks the rest of the way) from Washington D.C. to NY in like two days (All during this 2nd ICE AGE!!!!). No trying to stop the storm or anything\x85 he just WALKS. He's not even trying to save his son because he can't\x85 he just walks hundreds of miles to meet his son. That's it. Oh yeah, and during the middle of the movie the kids trapped in the library in NY must venture out in the 'STORM' for medicine\x85 and as luck would have it (or Hollywood overkill) they're attacked by a pack of wolves that escaped from the zoo. And the wolves look TERRIBLE. The special effects for the weather are easy so that all looks great\x85 but these wolves looked horrible.

I'm not a big fan of Wonder Woman, but I can say that this movie is my favorites from DC, but that doesn't say much considering the past. I really like the period in which the action of the film takes place, during a real war is not something usual for a movie with superheroes. The actors are good, so is the action, maybe act 3 is a bit weak, but it works."", 'Whether or not you\'ll love ""Wonder Woman"" no doubt will depend on the individual. The die-hard superhero film lovers have embraced the picture and it\'s setting box office records...and these folks really shouldn\'t read or pay much attention to my review. This is because I am over 50 and got tired of the genre long, long ago. I went to quite a few of the films because my daughters love them and this time was was actually taken to the theater by my wife, as she loves the idea of a female superhero. So, if you fall into my demographics...this review is for you!The story is pretty different from my concept for ""Wonder Woman"". This is NOT a complaint...I know a lot of superhero stuff changes. But instead of the WWII setting I expected, the film was set during the final days of WWI. The history teacher in me was intrigued...especially since they actually got the look of the film just right--costumes, airplanes, soldiers, etc.. They also heightened the bleakness of the era by severely restricting the color palate to shades of gray and brown--even the reds looked rather brown. I think this was a good choice...after all, war is horrible. Overall, there really wasn\'t much to dislike about the film. It had TONS of CGI and action...and that is what many fans want. As for me, I would have liked a bit less and more focus on story....but that is a very typical complaint for folks like me! However, if you do get pulled into going to see it, it won\'t bore you and offers a few nice twists.By the way, if you saw the film as well, were you ALSO horribly disappointed when the lady scientist\'s mask came off like I was?! I was expecting so much worse.', ""One of the best super hero movies ever. Up there with the dark knight, original Superman movie, captain America civil war, X-Men: Days of Future Past. Gal gadot did a great job. Don't listen to the haters. Haters will find things to complain about EVERYTHING."", ""Gal Gadot is so beautiful and l love her so much.My heart beats faster while the camera cuts to her.She has toned figure which appeals to me the most.You must go and see it,l promise you won't be disappointed."", 'A really solid DC film in a time where the company has struggled to muster post Christopher Nolan success.', 'Does anyone remember what fun is?\nI loved this movie', 'First of all, this movie only made money because it\'s a superhero movie. Everyone likes superheroes and there is no way a parent is not going to take their children to see it. Look at Transformers. Most of the movies are downright idiotic but it still makes money because it\'s.....Transformers. So all popular comic book hero movies will make money period. I can\'t make sense of the movie and I really don\'t think the writers knew either. Her morales flip flop, the bad guy has no real reason to be ""bad"", the good guy has no real reason to ""die."" The side characters really didn\'t serve much of a purpose.Some parts of the movie are decent and a few seconds later, the same scene turn into a total crapfest. The 3rd part is an utter mess and that act alone should be more then enough reason to keep WW off the top of the charts but somehow has a 94% rating on RT? That right there shows you that ratings are padded because you can\'t have at least 1/3 of a movie be total trash, 1/3 of the movie just corny dialog and somehow end up at the top of the charts.', 'I was expecting the ""glitzy"" curvy wonder woman which I loved in the 80\'s but VERY pleasantly surprised to find the Warrier Princess side of her that deeply cares for humanity and the good that are in people. She is unconcerned with her looks and trying to impress others, and way more concerned with saving the world as she was meant to do. This film really showed the process of her becoming a true heroine! She loves, she protects, she saves. Wonder Woman is a great character and I think she was cast beautifully! She looks ""other-worldly"" beautiful and fit the part so well. The film was written well to show her innocence of the ""real"" world, her joy of seeing it and it\'s people for the first time, and her passion for saving us all!Team Wonder Woman Forever!This is a film I could watch over and over. :D', '""Wonder Woman"" was a captivating addition to the superhero genre, earning a 7/10 in my opinion. Its strength lay in Gal Gadot\'s compelling portrayal of the iconic heroine, infusing the character with both strength and vulnerability. The film\'s cinematography showcased visually stunning action sequences, with Themyscira\'s lush landscapes serving as a standout. The supporting cast, particularly Chris Pine, added depth to the story with strong performances. While the music and visuals were effective, they didn\'t always leave a lasting impression. Overall, ""Wonder Woman"" delivered a powerful and long-overdue female-led superhero story, though it had some minor weaknesses in terms of music and visual impact that kept it just shy of perfection.', 'I wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I just can\'t get aboard the hype train. It\'s really the same as every other cartoonish, overblown comic-book action movie, except with a female protagonist.Actually, this is worse than the average comic book movie, because it preaches to the audience about pacifism but then hypocritically celebrates ""heroic"" violence. In other words: Wonder Woman is an alleged pacifist who kills a bunch of people. Wonder Woman is also an alleged feminist, who allows Steve Trevor to drive the entire plot and basically steal the movie from her. Really, this thing is about as progressive as Dick Cheney\'s great-great grandfather.I could forgive Wonder Woman\'s flimsy social commentary, if it were any good in other respects. But the plot is loose and shabby, the CGI is poor, and about half the scenes were shot in front of a green screen. Sometimes, I couldn\'t tell if I was watching a real movie, or Patty Jenkins playing God of War on her Playstation 2. (When exactly did cinema and video games blend into this horrible hybrid art form, which has none of the beauty and charm of old-school cinema?)And don\'t get me started on the villains. The World War I era Germans are depicted as cartoonishly eeeevil, while the same era\'s British Empire is held up as a heroic ideal. Meanwhile, the main villain is a nightmare of bad CGI, who looks like he belongs on a 1980s heavy metal album cover. Naturally, they got a wonderful actor for this stupid part and wasted him entirely.Perhaps I\'m going overboard on criticisms, but we need some balance to the rapturous praise this film has received. Movie fans often accuse professional critics of being too harsh, but lately, I think critics have actually become too lenient. Mainstream movies get dumber, louder and tackier all the time, and they are increasingly substituting mawkishness for real emotion and character development. And yet the critics have given this thing a great Rotten Tomatoes rating! I guess we\'ve all lowered our standards to rock bottom?', ""It would be easy to pick apart Wonder Woman, but I don't want to -- I enjoyed myself too much while watching it. Gal Godot is completely believable as the title character, and Chris Pine plays a good second fiddle. It's a pretty standard origin movie, and the rest of the supporting cast is a bit weak, but this is definitely a welcome addition to the DC film franchise."", ""It's no secret that the DCEU had a rough start. I personally did not like Suicide Squad or Man of Steel and, although I enjoyed Batman vs. Superman, I know that it is not a very good movie. Wonder Woman needed to be good. This universe was in dire need of a win and they absolutely got one with this movie.First off, Wonder Woman herself was absolutely brilliant in this film. She was bright, hopeful, and innocent and was unbelievably likable. Gal Gadot played her wonderfully and I cannot wait to see more of her. I really felt that I had connected with this character on so many levels. Chris Pine's character was not particularly deep, but I still cared about him and loved his relationship with Diana Prince. They had fantastic chemistry and the way that they taught each other about each other's worlds was brilliant and made for some excellent comedy as well. I was incredibly saddened when Chris Pine's character sacrificed himself at the end of the film and Wonder Woman's tear- jerking reaction was very emotionally involving.The action was fantastic, but that was no surprise since it looked so good in the trailers. The World War I sequence was ridiculously entertaining and I wish I could have seen more of it. The final sequence with Ares was also extremely exciting.My favorite scene in the film was when Steve warned Diana not to cross No Man's Land and she climbs the ladder anyway. I got goosebumps all over and was on the edge of my seat. That scene was Grade-A filmmaking. Wonder Woman is extremely inspirational in this movie and that scene embodies her character. Scenes like that were the most memorable for me. As awesome as the action was, the moments that flesh out her character and her relationship with Steve were the best part of the film.My main issues with the film mostly involve the villains. Dr. Poison seemed like she would be an intriguing character, but felt very bland and the movie never revealed what her true motivations were. General Ludendorff was an actual person in WWI, but his presence felt somewhat unnecessary and I did not feel that he was a great villain. The gas that he used to give him strength was also not needed and felt utterly pointless and out of place in the movie. I liked Ares, but the reveal of who his character actually was somewhat cheap. His motivations for showing the ugly side of humanity were very similar to Heath Ledger's Joker and I did enjoy that. My other main negative was that I also would have liked more emotional moments while Wonder Woman was on Themyscira, but I was satisfied with what we got in that particular part of the movie. Another great element of this movie was the fact that it stands on its own. There's no forced reveal of any of the Justice League characters nor is there an unnecessary setup for that movie. You could argue that this is because of the time period that this movie takes place in, but I think that Patty Jenkins really wanted to make a film that was separated from the other DCEU movies. I absolutely loved the opening scene in which she opens up a suitcase from Bruce Wayne and views the picture of her from WWI. It was the perfect way to tie the film into DCEU without going overboard. It was also the perfect way to set the stage for Diana Prince's story. The closing scene where she thanked Wayne via Email was also cool. The movie is also incredibly well-directed. Patty Jenkins is a true talent and I look forward to seeing what else she does in the DCEU and beyond. The movie is colorful, vibrant, and lively and looks utterly gorgeous. I loved the stark contrast between the clean, tropical Themyscira and the dirty, war-torn locations outside of it. Overall, Wonder Woman really gave the DCEU the push it needed. Wonder Woman now has a fantastic backstory which will really add to her character going forward. I cannot wait to see this character in Justice League and I look forward to seeing the movie many more times.8/10 Grade: A-"", 'Maybe, one of the most inspired films about WWI. and one of the most impressive Wonder Woman performances. because it has the best plot, the director, the actors . I say that without be a fan of Marvel universe and defining the super-heroes of series as ""American culture stuffs"". but this film has many virtues. first - a seductive perspective about near reality, bitter references, good pledge for fundamental values and , sure, Gal Gadot brilliant work. pieces of mithology and war. and a photo. as good start for a character who, in Superman vs. Batman was the not official lead character and who, in this film, gives more than a beautiful job.', 'I love Wonder Woman and I was really excited to see this. And after watching this movie, I enjoyed it. This was a great DC film to the DCEU.', ""Gal Gadot and Chris Pine both give a fantastic performance in this superhero film... the story was relatively original given how much of a generic formula most of this action hero genre follows... the character development was unique and special.. the story was nice and heartfelt but had some weak moments that weren't necessary and made the film longer than it needed to be... between this and The Dark Knight, DC has been keeping its legacy in modern cinema going strong.."", 'Gal Gadot is the perfect actress for this role, the movie is well paced, with a well composed theme song. Eventhough they greatly nerfed her character power, the movie has thrilling action and the Amazonian goddess is well represented. Though I admit, it was still a little to groomy and dark for the tone for my taste.\nGenerally, a very safe movie if you just want to enjoy something.', ""Looking at these reviews i felt i had to write one myself. All i see is marvel fans saying how bad this film is.Trust me this is a good watch i watched in cinema and at home both times i enjoyed.the beginning is a good introduction of wonder woman and the Amazonians.If you are looking for a good action film with a good cast and story this is it. The scenery is amazing and the action scenes look amazing there are even funny scenes in this film.Don't listen to the haters who feel threatened by this film just watch and enjoy as i have and others."", ""Gal Gadot is perfectly cast and her interaction with Chris Pine on screen is great, their characters have a lot of chemistry. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but some parts seem to drag a little, but it doesn't really affect the enjoyment of the film for me. The final battle is a bit cheesy in terms of the main villain's revealed motivation and dialogue, but nothing really too bad."", ""WONDER WOMAN - I don't know much about Wonder Woman comics. But i know that Superman comics are based on two themes. HOPE and BELIEVE IN HUMANITY. Patty Jenkins as a director took these two themes from Superman and made a Wonder Woman movie or i can say Woman Of Steel.This is basically a FISH OUT OF THE WATER storyline. The movie shows how Wonder Woman deal with the new world about which she don't know much while trying to stop World War 1. This is by far the simplest story of DCEU. Simpler then MAN OF STEEL and DAWN OF JUSTICE. M not counting Suicide Squad because i don't see much of a story in that film. But being simple is not a bad thing. In fact its great as long as origin stories goes. M glade that Themyscira the birth place of WW is given enough time to explore. Which brings me to the cinematography. From Themyscira(which has been shot in South Wales and looked gorgeous) to England to Berlin , everything looked beautiful in this movie. And the 3d is better then THE MUMMY , although i still recommend to watch it in 2d. Jokes were an integral part of the story. All of them are because of the lack of knowledge of WW about the outer world.And these jokes makes the character of WW a little bit of Naive and whole lot sweeter . Some of the jokes also goes little out of the line as long as preferability of Kids goes,I have to say i am very happy with the action sequences of the movie. True that every movie cant achieve the level of Matrix , Man Of Steel and Mad Max , but WW came pretty close. And i liked all of them. Specially the climax one. Which was too close to the climax of Dawn Of Justice , but Patty here injected some serious emotional moments of WW having the self realization , which made the action scene better. Cant go forward without talking about the scores. The whole movie has been ''VIOLINISED''. I know that not exactly a real word but i still used it. And yes the WW theme , came out 3-4 times . And its awesome. Could have been used even more. Gal Gadot is exceptional. On a level that there has been some Oscar talks running around. She well managed the Boldness and Naiveness of the character nicely. And set a benchmark in action scenes for female super heroes. Chris Pinn , called as box office poison(a star who makes flops despite good acting.) is giving here one of his best performance , and yes the movie is working very well at box office and some credit goes to him. What else to say , m happy as well as relieved to see that the movie is good. I was hoping too much from it and it paid of. 8.8/10by ANuP APu KuMaR"", ""Chris Pine had way more dialogue than Gal Gadot. Not gonna go into why I think that is or why just about every other actor had more lines than her. I just hope everything improves with the next movie. I think he got equal screen-time, if not not more than Gal as well. This is Wonder Woman right? Not Steve Trevor, wonder man.I found Wonder Woman too vanilla. Yes we need a female hero with compassion and heart but she was just too flat of a character. I think there's not much to her. You know like Spiderman, Batman, Superman have childhood and teenage trauma. Even Black Widow appears to have of a traumatic background. But Wonder Woman pretty much had the perfect childhood and the perfect teenage years, and she decides she wants to be a hero for the world, because well, just because. See what I mean, there's nothing there. I don't know if this is the same in the comic books, but if so, then I wouldn't have minded if they changed things up a bit. The character's naivety didn't help. She doesn't know a thing about mankind. Why exactly does she want to be their hero? Oh yeah, just because. I like complex characters that struggle and develop becoming multi-layered. I find those type of characters interesting and fascinating. Diana/WW isn't any of this and frankly I find her kind of boring.I wish Diana was WW right from the beginning already in mankind's world with flashbacks to her training with the Amazons. The fish out of water stuff got tired pretty quickly. Steve would keeps mentioning things that Diana had no clue about and she'd keep repeating a word in a questioning way.So that little skinny guy was Ares huh? That was a disappointment.The best scenes were that of the Amazons. Wish there was more scenes with them. I liked the actions scenes. I just thought the plot was boring and immature. They went through this whole movie so that Diana could find out that mankind had a dark side. We the audience already know this just as we knew Ares didn't cause people to be bad. In the end she realized love was the answer. Let's all sing kumbaya now. Hey it's fiction! Love is always the answer in some sort of way. But did we have to go through a whole somewhat boring movie for this?The Greek Gods are written as noble and heroic(except for Ares)? Nobody ever read any classical literature I guess.Overall, the movie is ok, with good action scenes. Gal looks good as Wonder Woman. I want to see more female action movies. I want to see more Wonder Woman, but with better scripts and mature writing. Loved the Amazons and loved Antiope. Wish there was more of her. Also loved the Etta character. I gave it a 7/10."", ""I'm definitely the minority here, but I can't get over the fact that this film is rated higher than films like Enter the Void, Moonlight, The Kings Speech, Spotlight and sooo many other much better films. The critics took the money on this one and ran. To me, this film was cheesy, campy, and completely missed the mark. The ridiculous costume that is clearly symbolic for America ( there's clearly a fuc*ing gold eagle on her chest and it's red white and blue), yet she hails from Greece and calls herself an Amazonian God - WTF?!! AMAZONIAN!?!?!? I was so confused. Then, there is an American who is a British Spy (huh?) Most of the German Nazis speak with British accents and she can deflect bullets yet she loses her hearing to explosions.... I'm sorry, but I just could not get past this to enjoy the film. As an origin story, it's completely ludicrous. Maybe it worked back when the comic was written, but today it just comes off as a desperate attempt to pry the money from people that want to be viewed as politically correct. If you study film and take movies seriously, you should avoid a visit to the theater for this one. Watch it at home for free and make your own opinion, but I can see this media-con being laughable in 20 years.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Now I know I will be in the minority with my opinion, and that\'s perfectly fine. After all, I gave ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" a solid nine (loooove it). Anyway, in a ravaged and desolate futuristic Earth a tech team are stationed on the planet to ensure hydro rigs are fully operational before being sent to Titan where humanity currently resides. However, they must battle against ""Scavengers"" who set out to destroy these rigs and droids. Why? What could possibly be the reason? Well...stay away from the hideous trailer, unfortunately it reveals far too much. So aside from the hideous marketing, this film is incredible. I\'ve seen it a good twenty times and never get bored. Again, I know most of you will disagree with me...but all the ingredients for a thinking sci-fi are there and unequivocally are blended to make a memorable film. This is two for two for director Joseph Kosinski as far as I\'m concerned. ""Tron: Legacy"" is a personal favourite, and so is this. He makes visual audio experiences. The visual effects here are gorgeous, from the clean white architecture to the desolate horizon. Everything looked outstanding, particularly the interior of \'The Tet\'. Then we come to M83\'s soundtrack which is an entrancing piece of synthesised electronic goodness. The two technical aspects compliment each other so well to create, not just a film, but an experience. You guys know me by now, I will always have a soft spot for technically accomplished films. The acting is slightly monotonous, but it works for the environment that they are in. Andrea Riseborough is a personal favourite of mine, she\'s damn good in everything. The story has plenty of twists and turns, particularly when breaching the Radiation Zone. A few scenes of exposition and narration but not enough to become a detriment to the narrative. Like I said, I\'m in the minority...and I don\'t care, I love this film.', 'The trivia tells us that this is based on a comic book that director joseph kosinski wrote in 2005 but was never published. The story takes place in 2077, just after the ""memory wipe"" that jack (cruise) describes for us. And the invasion by space travelers, which destroyed most of the cities and made living on the surface mostly impossible. Some great special effets. The control panels, the copter, even the wrecked surface of the planet. Jack is tasked with protecting the structures that support the floating living quarters for the remaining population. I LOVE the mini moto that jack rides around on... kind of like a george jetson briefcase that folds and unfolds. Google it. Some beautiful scenery of iceland, and various film locs in the united states. When another human from the past crash lands, we\'re not sure what her mission is, or who\'s side she is on. Some really good suspense, while we wait for answers. Especially when morgan freeman is involved. Really good sci-fi stuff!', ""Coming out of the theatres following my viewing of this film, I was confused. I couldn't decide whether I liked it or not.The ending was rushed, clichéd and quite cheesy, that I was sure about. But I had enjoyed the film, more or less. The visuals are stunning. The cinematography was truly impressive and I think it is these Prometheus-esque visuals (in terms of quality) that successfully manage to distract you from what is actually quite an appalling film.The storyline is shallow and the large majority of characters undeveloped (I honestly don't see much point in Morgan Freeman's character). Even after the real human faction is revealed and a group of drones rampage around massacring everyone, you just don't feel anywhere near the amount of sympathy as you should do.When the super villain is finally revealed, anyone who has seen 2001: A Space Odyssey will have immediately recognised a blown up version of Hal. The (fairly predictable) clone twist is reminiscent of Moon although it is accepted by the characters after only a couple of seconds of conflict.The first twenty minutes however, were very good (minus the lightning scene). The setting of the post apocalyptic time frame was laid out beautifully with a collection of scenes which almost reminded me of a futuristic version of I Am Legend.Yes underneath the film is a very generic amalgamation of various sci-fis that came before and it is definitely not a masterpiece in itself, but to the open minded viewer it provides more than enough to give you an easy two hours of mild entertainment and pretty landscapes.(Does anyone else question Tom Cruise's morals in stranding his wife alone in a valley for three years, thus forcing her to give birth by herself? Oh yeah and when did that happen? Hours after she was shot? Wait how did she recover?)"", 'I love Tom Cruise in action + science fiction movies. He is one of the few actors who seem to believe those futuristic roles and is usually great in this sort of films. That being the case, I was looking forward to watching this film.From the production and design point of view, this is a fantastic film, spectacular scenery and camera takes, very sleek futuristic design and a great atmosphere. Unlike your usual galactic out space story, this is not dark or cold, but very light, airy, bright and beautiful.The story starts very promisingly, but soon deflates because the script starts to wander unnecessarily and is not organically presented to viewers, who will feel in a constant state of What the Heck? Once the action starts. The plot, albeit intriguing and original, is not well developed for the big screen, and it is not clear enough, does not have a good tempo, it does not build up properly for the ending, and the editing contributes to the narrative confusion, when, in fact, the script is not that complex.Personally, I think Andrea Riseborough is the best of the bunch in this film";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

You had some fun, and the rest, when looked at objectively, was garbage AND WE WATCHED THIS IN RPX which makes me wonder how many others who are giving it glowing reviews (aside from reviewing only this one film), are doing so because of the theater experience, and not the film itself.The problem I have, is that if the creators this time around wanted to give us just action and adventure, they should have done that and just left all the boring and annoying parts out. Even the chemistry between Owen and Claire was dead, no matter how many times the camera held her looking at him with parted lips and a dreamy gaze. The baddies were just silly. Also, many of the parts that may have been moved to the fun or good column were ruined by the Franklin computer guy or the other character meant to assuage the PC crowd (and I say that as a living, breathing, card carrying liberal). The little cloned girl was there for one purpose (I won\'t give it away), but her story was dumb. They literally could have introduced her at the beginning as ""This is Macey, a clone of my daughter"", and it would not have made a difference except for allowing them to cut out all the unnecessary scenes spent on this that drama.

And are we to believe that the mercenaries show up on a dino hunt armed with standard issue military issue rifles (5.56 mm and or 7.62x51 mm) and sleeper dart rifles? Granted, they didn't intend killing the animals but those guns aren't powerful enough for modern big game animals let alone animals with hides thicker then rhinos, hippos, or elephants.

That was a great film and stands on its own, no question.But this also isn't a remake. Sure, it uses some of the same elements -some characters with the same names, 3 minis, a carefully planned heist, a robbery/chase where they drive through all sorts of unexpected places, traffic chaos arising from overriding the official system etc. But all those elements are used in a completely different story to the original with completely different character dynamics.I liked it. Importantly, there was so much that was different in the story that I never felt the need to compare it to the original.Mark Wahlberg, low-rent action protagonist, was marginally less inexpressive than usual, and the rest of the cast gave reliable performances. A special mention must go to Seth Green, occupying the Benny Hill slot as official bollixer of traffic lights - a quite different character (no big ladies for a start off!) but still a very funny performance.The original is still out there, folks, and it's still great, but this version has a lot going for it - don't discount it."", ""If you are looking for a film that is quick witted and won't bore you then this is the place.  It is fast paced and funny with some decent acting comeing from the characters.  It is always hard for me to see Mark Walhberg as anything except Marky Mark.  That image is burned in my mind forever.  As an actor though he is pretty good.  This movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns.  I will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it."", 'Greetings again from the darkness.  Today\'s giant movie screens and earth rumbling sound systems make action films an exhilarating experience.  Throw in a nice story and some eye candy and it is truly a blast.  OK the story is just a reshaping of the original with Michael Caine, but the added humor - mostly supplied by Seth Green (""Austin Powers"" and ""Knockaround Guys"") and the super cool guys - Jason Statham, Marky Mark and veteran Donald Sutherland add a punch to this one.  Who am I kidding?  The big difference here is the eye candy!  The mini-Coopers and Charlize Theron add a touch of Bond.  Whether the stunner is driving the fun cars or cracking a safe in her hotel room, she is captivating.  The films weak link is the usually dependable Edward Norton who seems to be sleep walking through his role. Maybe he has reached the point where he feels he deserves more screen time. His role is important, but his lackluster performance doesn\'t ruin the film at all.  Would have enjoyed seeing what a meatier performance could have added to the film, though.  Anyway, enjoy the ride and the view!', 'I went to see THE ITALIAN JOB with mixed reviews in my head.  I was pleasantly surprised with an entertaining close to 2 hours.  I thought the cast was just great and so were the special effects, with the safe and truck just dropping out of sight.  If you like fast paced action movies, this is the one to see.', ""John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) and team successfully steal $35 million in gold in Venice, Italy. They get double-crossed by team member Steve (Edward Norton) and John is killed. After finding Steve in L. A., Charlie reassembles the team to rob Steve and get revenge. However, he needs the help of John Bridger's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), a professional safe cracker who uses her skills for good. This also stars Seth Green, Mos Def, and Jason Statham as members of the team. That's a great group of actors, and they had a fun time driving Mini Coopers thru L. A. traffic and under L. A. And I think we all had fun."", 'This is a woeful Hollywood remake of a classic British film. Everything that made the original ""Italian Job"" entertaining has been bled out of this festering sore of a movie ""scripted"" by Donna and Wayne Powers and listlessly ""directed"" by F Gary Gray. I am amazed that Troy Kennedy Martin (the screenwriter of the original film) allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig\'s ear. Martin has worked on some of the finest film and TV projects of the last 40-odd years. Even being vaguely associated with this stinker is NOT A GOOD THING.The humour is forced, the drama is laboured, all the characters are cookie-cutter likable crims (with the exception of Charlize Theron\'s implausible, beautiful safe cracker/rally driver)and the plot only matches the original on the following points:(1) Three Minis (the modern BMW-made versions, but Minis nonetheless)(2) Use of the names Croker and Bridger for 2 of the main characters(3) Disrupting a city\'s traffic control system to provide a safe route through it.(4) Er, that\'s it.Otherwise, what you get is a bland and implausible American by-the-numbers heist movie in which a gang of jolly pirate chums eventually get the better of their evil associate. Believe me, it feels like an awful long time before they do. The cast do their best with what they\'re given but it seems that they all accepted it as a turd-polishing exercise after reading the script. None of the original film\'s quirky nature and distinctly British flavour has survived being fed into the Hollywood hamburger machine. Do yourself a favour and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this sucking chest wound. It\'s a wonder that Noel Coward hasn\'t done an Aunt Nelly, jumped out of his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this tepid remake halfway down their throats.Italian Job? More like Italian Jobbie.', ""The 1969 film I don't revere as a classic but it was very entertaining, and I have to say this film is just as enjoyable. While inferior in some aspects I actually noticed one or two improvements. The plot does meander slightly in the second half, and I found Edward Norton's villain too sleazy and one-dimensional. The film is also a tad too long by about two or three minutes. But it is very fast paced, looks great, has a great soundtrack and has some wonderful set pieces, very like the 1969 film. Where the improvements come are in the direction and the script, here the direction is super-charged, in the 1969 film I found it too flashy, and the script was smarter and more consistent. And the acting wasn't bad either. Mark Wahlberg takes on the Michael Caine role with real enthusiasm and charm and Seth Green is very funny in a very different role. Not to mention Charlize Theron, who is very beguiling as the sassy safe cracker. Overall, entertaining and enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox"", 'With all the money that movie studios make, it\'s nice to know that there are still people out there who can take the time out of their busy schedule to thank the people who got them where they are. Paramount for example has been kind enough to shrink down their latest caper movie, ""The Italian Job"" in to a nice 45 second trailer. If one is fortunate enough to catch this on TV (which shouldn\'t be a problem), they should take the time to write Paramount and thank them for keeping $7-$10 in their wallet. This movie was THAT 45 SECOND TRAILER STRETCHED OUT OVER 90 MINUTES. I am sorry, but they put everything that would have been enjoyable about this movie in the trailer. From Seth Green\'s one liners to the (anti)climactic car chase, the movie seemed to drag if only because I was used to seeing it resolved in under a minute instead of two hours. Save your money for something else, just take it as a thank you from Paramount.', ""In crime films, protagonist's side breaks laws, steals money, and do all illegal crimes, so it is important that they win the sympathy of audience. They are usually intelligent and charming. The more important thing is that they do not cause damage to harmless people first. However, threatening pedestrians by taking car race into peaceful sidewalk and messing with public transport system filled with many citizens are all started by Charlie's gang as Steve puts it. Steve becomes the one who follows 'gang' into totally unrelated innocent people. Also Steve is the one who distances from the mass and the mess on the road.Story seems disconnected at the half of the movie. Preparation and planning part of the crime become totally different and useless after what's put into action hastily at the end. Finally, Wahlberg and Theron's performance is not charismatic enough to lead the movie, audience, or their team."", ""I'm not an authority when it comes to the Michael Caine movie this was based BUT I will say that I enjoyed this movie.  It was great seeing Edward Norton as a bad guy.  Seth Green was funny and Mark Wahlberg was on point as usual.This movie is nothing ground breaking as far as dramatic performances go, but it does follow in the tradition of fun caper movies like Soderbergh's remake of Ocean's Eleven.In a nutshell, it's just an easy to follow, fun action movie.

Receiving lukewarm reviews on its 1969 release, Peter Collinson\'s sensational crime caper has worn well, blessed with enough 60s swagger, swinging music and quotable lines to make it quaint while equal amounts of laughs, story spinning brio and cunning stuntwork keep it fresh.Add stunning Continental vistas and the kind of crowdpleasing antics that only really take flight in the cinema, this opportunity to catch it on a big screen is not to be missed.Penned by Z Cars writer Kennedy Martin, The Italian Job is a story of charmingly absurdist conceits";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Arnold Schwarzenegger is a spy trying to keep his profession a secret from his wife(Jamie Lee Curtis)and realizes that she is having an affair. The mild mannered salesman is really a double fisted devil may care secret agent. The beginning and final sequences are a movie in themselves. My favorite scenes are Curtis\' striptease in the hotel and her ""cat fight"" with the gorgeous Tia Carrere in the limo. Plenty of gun fights and big bangs to please everyone. The cast also features Bill Paxton, Art Malik and Tom Arnold in his funniest and greatest role as Schwarzenegger\'s sidekick. There is a small role for Charlton Heston as the stern single minded boss. Absolute entertainment.', 'This is unquestionably one of the best action films ever made, with phenomenal action scenes and 2 amazing performances from Arnie and Jamie Lee Curtis!. All the characters are wonderful, and the story is extremely gripping, plus Arnie and Jamie Lee Curtis are simply amazing in this!.The finale is simply incredible and is one of the most exciting ever, and i thought Arnie and Jamie Lee had amazing chemistry together, plus The ending was downright hilarious!. The chase scene with Arnie riding the horse, and Art Malik (the villain) riding the motorcycle, and i must say the famous dancing scene with Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic, Jamie Lee is incredibly sexy, plus the supporting cast was great, and even Tom Arnold made me chuckle, and i always find him annoying!. The film is extremely exciting throughout, and some of the stunts were absolutely incredible, plus Arnie had some fantastic one liners as usual! ("" Your Fired""!). 2 of my favorite scenes, include The fantastic Bridge sequence where Arnie drags Jamie Lee Curtis in an helicopter with 1 hand, and another one of my favorites includes Jamie, dropping the gun, and it starts firing while falling down the stairs that was great!.I can\'t believe this only has a 7.0 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion, and unlike a lot of of viewers i found the focus on the Arnie/Jamie Lee relationship/affair in the middle, extremely entertaining, plus Eliza Dishku is fantastic as Arnie\'s daughter!. There are plenty of awesome explosions and even at 141 minutes it left me wanting more, plus Bill Paxton is great as the slime ball, and played his part extremely well. The dialog is awesome, and the opening was excellent, plus Art Malik, and Tia Carrere are extremely menacing as the main villains!. The Bathroom scenes will give you a lot to laugh about, and the score was very good, plus i though Arnold\'s acting was fantastic!. This is unquestionably one of the best action films ever made in my opinion, with phenomenal action scenes, and 2 amazing performances from Arnie Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis, and if you haven\' seen it, drop what your doing immediately and do so!, you won\'t be disappointed.The Direction is simply incredible!. James Cameron does an incredible job here, with wonderful camera work, jaw dropping angles, great slow mo shots, some good POV shots, and keeping the film at an extremely fast pace!.There is a bit of blood and violence. We get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds, harsh beatings,scalpel in the eye,gunshot wound to the head, with blood and brains spurting, and other minor stuff.The Acting is amazing!. Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, kicks that ass, had some fantastic one liners, had amazing chemistry with Jamie Lee Curtis, , was hilarious, really seemed to be enjoying himself,had a great relationship with Tom Arnold, and just did an amazing job overall!. (Arnie Rules!!!!!). Jamie Lee Curtis is also AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, she is stunningly gorgeous, incredibly sexy, is fantastic in the acting department, had amazing chemistry with Arnie, had an awesome character, and managed to make her potential extremely boring business woman like character, extremely interesting just with her presence, i really hope her and Arnie make True Lies 2!. (Jamie Lee Rules!!!!!).Tom Arnold is surprisingly funny, and not once did he get on my nerves and was quite likable actually!, he also had a great relationship with Arnie!. Eliza Dushku is extremely cute as the daughter, and did fantastic here, she was especially awesome in the finale, wished she had more screen time though!. (Dushku Rules!!). Bill Paxtonis great as the slime ball, and did his job very well i liked him lots!. Art Malik is awesome as the main villain, he had some great lines, and was extremely menacing!.

Whilst it doesnt rate as high in action compared to the other Arnie movies.   This is definately arnies best comedy and with the above average action, it makes this movie Arnies best overall movie.  Heaps of good explosions, shooting and hand to hand combat and hilarious comedy from all cast members.  Art Malik and his men were hilarious especially when they were trying to be serious.  Tom Arnold is perfect for his role, hilarious without even trying.  But the funniest of all would have to be Bill Paxton especially while he is in the car with Arnie describing Jamie Lee Curtis to him and role playing a secret agent. Truely belly aching laughter!  Tia Carrera and Jamie Lee Curtis were absolutely gorgeous.  Who could ever forget that striptease by Jamie Lee Curtis? A 10/10 for me.  I havent felt so good after watching a movie for a long time."", ""I SHOULD love TRUE LIES. I mean, I love the track records of almost all those involved, and this was a hugely successful movie packed with explosive action. It's a film that mixes in ample comedy with the thrills and most people seem to love it. Yet it's a film that leaves me somewhat cold, and no amount of sophisticated special effects shots can change that.Sadly, what we have here starts out as a promising Bond-style spy thriller that gradually descends to the level of a lame comedy, padded out with sleaze and pee jokes masquerading as family cinema. Man, I don't know what Cameron was thinking when he wrote the screenplay, but he clearly didn't employ the services of an editor to take out a lot of endless padding. TRUE LIES is an example of a director at his self-indulgent worst.Don't get me wrong, I love the spy stuff in this film. Arnie is at the top of his game, throwing plenty of workable humour into the mix, and the action scenes look highly impressive";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Some mass dialogues dedicated to making the scenes more powerful are turned into a line drawn in the water. Prominent performers attempt to deliver humorous lines, but without acting, they lose their impact. For certain scenes, certain performers are superfluous. If the goal of this film was to amuse viewers, then it succeeded. But why should the audience be amused by shady acting and irrelevant background music? This film's plot is incredibly implausible and unfit for a great star. The movie was utterly destroyed by its primary elements, such as the twists at the end.

If you like that, you will love this.Personally though, after about 60 minutes I got a bit tired of the movie, As much as the actions scenes are great, they lacked unqiue elements later on in the movie.

And with it (roll eyes moment) rules, regulations, protocol etc which are all becoming too often and too much these days.What this means is, we get an all out action-packed opening of 20-odd minutes before the show becomes a platform for product placements and poorly choreographed fight scenes where you can see Keanu 'acting' more than fighting and in fact, struggling to keep up (and not because he is injured or has been thrown about). The fight scenes, many shot wide angle, do not have the energy and intensity of the opening sequences and there are many, many moments where you feel 'oh come on, John's whole body is open for attack'.

There has been much talk about the class system/hierarchy and how the assassins judicial system works. Well it doesn't make much more sense in this chapter either!

And I always advocate for the artists (directors) creating art without studio interference. But while the original Justice League is one end of the spectrum with studio interference up the butt, this seems like the other end, where the director is a bit overindulgent. Many of the scenes are completely unnecessary to the story and some even feel like deleted scenes from a DVD extra.Again, I was not bored, but rewatchability comes into play when I rate. I definitely want to watch this again, but the 4 hour runtime will significantly reduce repeat viewings. Somewhere in here, there is a 3 hour and 15 minute perfect cut which I would rate 8/10.EDIT: Watching this again, I'm so sad and angry at this studio. There are so many cool things foreshadowed as possible futures in this world. Even years later, I want to see them SO BAD. And it drives me crazy that we never will because they decided to reboot. They had something special here. They are idiots.(2 viewings, 3/21/2021, 6/14/2023)SPOILERSIn the original, the mother boxes were just a useless MacGuffin that I didn't care about. Now the mother boxes are actually a huge part of the story. In the original the villain was the most bland cookie cutter villain ever, now I actually know why he does what he does. In the original they took Superman to General Zod's ship to revive him with the mother box and none of that made sense to me but I just went with it and didn't ask questions. Now it makes way more sense.The scenes I imagine should be taken out are some of the scenes with Martha and Lois, the Martian Manhunter stuff, and some of the epilogue. I thought the epilogue was cool, but it was out of place here. And it makes it worse if they're not continuing this storyline, which as of now they are not."", ""Zack snyder's justice league is far better than theatrical cut, in every way you can think of, steppenwolf is an actual threat now, his cgi is great, he has a clear goal, but cyborg is the heart of the movie and one of the best characters, Snyder did each hero justice, and flash powers are incredible and mind-blowing, Wonder woman is nothing like what we've seen in ww84, she is a valiant warrior and badass character, I really liked how they portrayed darkseid and paved the way for a potential JL2, he is an absolute great villain, and junkie xl music is really epic and great, overall 9/10 for this movie, I just had one problem with it: too much slow-motions\nNOW, it's time to RESTORE THE SNYDERVERSE"", ""It was a fan service, period. Good on Snyder for doing it too, I can imagine what man had to go through these last few years. I enjoyed a lot of the extra back story, I treated the film like a short series, which I thought was the original idea. A lot of the original content was mildly interesting, but it felt like Amazing Spider-man 2, where there's a lot of story to tell, but it's never told. There's a lot of fans comparing this to the likes of Lord of the Rings, but even the extended filler content for middle-earth had character development and plot direction. You just don't get that in this film. There's A LOT of filler, for no reason. A lot of going somewhere, looking someplace, finding someone and action sequences that just made me yawn, or were totally cringe, and are great examples as to why certain scenes should be left on the cutting-room floor. As I mention, this film was a fan service, it was a 'take it as you will' movie that was almost finished, and still isn't. Which is why I give it the benefit of the doubt, it's not meant to be a theatrical release in the least, it's a 'what if' and for some that's satisfying, to others it can be a bit of a snooze fest. But, bravo regardless!"", ""It's way better than the original mess that was shown in cinemas a few years back. That doesn't make it a great film. Whilst motivations and characters get their chance to shine it's still a slow plodding exposition heavy cartoon. It seems some fans are bumping this up way higher than it deserves to be based purely on them being fans, or perhaps all they require is a coherent story to think a film is amazing? Who knows. It's an ok watch, just don't get caught up in the blind hype and you won't have your expectations ruined."", 'The film is better than the ""original"" in pretty much every way, but only so much to bump the rating from the absolute ""1"" to the current ""5"".\nA lot of pointless slow-motion scenes that serve no other purpose than to force some emotions and a forced dialogue that propagates the story without any reason to.

For the non-comics out there, this movie is a waste of time.', 'The story of ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman vs. Superman"" is continued in this movie in such an epic way. This is totally different than the theatrical version. The visual storyline and cinematography is so unique and it\'s perfect.

At first, I didn't understand what all the excitement and hype were about when it was announced that the Snyder version was being released, but now I understand. The originally released movie was pretty awful. The storyline was disjointed and the character development was almost nonexistent. The Snyder version provided us with full storylines and character development for Cyborg and The Flash as well as eliminating some extraneous material that didn't add to the movie. If you like DC comics and were disappointed with the 2017 version of Justice League, go and see this version. You will be pleasantly surprised at how much better it is than the original."", ""If this was the original one released would you enjoy it? My answer is nope. Ppl are rating it high to try and prove it was worth making I guess. That being said It's certainly better than it's predecessor but falls extremely short of a good movie. The script is choppy, the music choice at times is mind blowingly awful, and I don't know who approves Snyder's use of slomo but they need to put a limit on how many times he is allowed to use it. This thing would've been ridiculed like BvS if joss' version was never created. The length does allow for Snyder to flesh out some characters, mostly the villains and cyborg. Yet somehow the film diminishes Aquaman and bats as characters. Four hours long and it still doesn't explain why there are goggles on Batman and why he has a random tank haha! Outside of that the only reason it's four hours long is because there is an hour worth of slomo! It's worth checking out if you were one clamoring for this version but don't expect Snyder to break away from all the stuff that made BvS terrible."", 'Gonna keep this short.

I see the movie as more of a struggle with the guy keeping his sanity over his own kids rather than the alien creatures."", ""I love the book and overall theme of the movie but Tom Cruise acting is annoying which is probably because he had to work with 2 most annoying kid actors ever seen on the film.\nI mean almost every scene is ruined by hysterical yelling of the 3 main characters. Little girl is the worst but Tom and his movie son are not far behind.I mean it's watchable but by the middle of the movie I was hoping aliens will take them down so we don't have to suffer this atrocity of acting"", 'I would\'ve had more respect for this movie, if it had been a completely new adaptation of the original novel, but instead it\'s a re-tread of the 1953 original George Pal film. Spielberg blatantly rehashed several scenes, most notable is the alien camera looking through the farm house and someone hacking at the camera with an axe.Surprisingly, the 1953 original had far more scenes of massive destruction in the cities, and a much more complex script. The subplot of the scientists and the military trying to find a way to defeat the Martians was much more interesting than Spielberg\'s re-hash. Here\'s a few things that really bugged me about the remake. Why would the aliens bury the machines long before the cities were built? If they wanted to conquer the Earth, it would have been easier to do it before humans evolved and multiplied! If the aliens were invincible and needed us for our blood, then why did they disintegrate masses of people with their ray-guns? And the worst detail is, the aliens themselves being transported within the bolts of lightning, thru the ground and into the machines!?#@wtf! How absurd!Frankly, I found long stretches of the remake to be boring and unnecessary, like going through the box of condiments and throwing the peanut butter sandwiches against the wall. The bread and peanut butter was the only real food they had. They\'re in a life & death struggle, and he just threw the food away. They had to write this stuff. Again, absurd! The best scene in the original was the battle of the Martian machines against the American military forces. Some of the best special effects ever produced for a film of that era. The remake has such a battle hidden behind a hill, while Tom Cruise whines to his kids in an effort to get their cooperation. They saved a lot of money on f/x for that scene.They spent over 130 million dollars for a weak remake and the special effects are the only redeemable value. The original 1953 movie only cost 2 million to make and it was a far better film.""Rachel, shutup!""', 'James Cameron and Stephen Spielberg famously ushered forward the CGI revolution in the early 90\'s with films like ""Terminator 2"" and ""Jurassic Park"". They set a trend, and since the late 90\'s we\'ve been hit with one CGI adventure movie after the other.But Spielberg had his fun with his CGI dinosaurs, and soon moved on. While lesser directors scrambled onto the CGI bandwagon, churning out soulless nonsense like ""Resident Evil"" and ""Tomb Raider"", Spielberg changed gears and directed ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Minority Report"", ""The Terminal"", ""AI"" etc. Argue about the quality of those movies all you want, but what I\'m trying to get at is that this guy tries his best to stay ahead of the game. Ahead of the trends.""Saving Private Ryan"" broke new ground. I think it\'s a bad film, but nevertheless, it now serves as a template for all future war movies. Look at ""Black Hawk Down"". Can you imagine it shot with the static feel of, say, ""Platoon""?So here we have ""War of the Worlds"", and again we see Spielberg developing a new ""eye"". And that is what fascinates me most about this film. The camera stays fixed on Cruise and his family. We catch fleeting glimpses of the alien invaders and their war machines. The destruction and special effects whir by in the background, ominous and looming but never dominating the screen.Spielberg\'s camera is always running away, frantic, afraid to look at the destruction, panning away from the effects, terrified! And what\'s terrific is that this new eye suits the story.I suppose it was only a matter of time before a director decided to consciously play down special effects for dramatic purposes. Spielberg treats his CGI as though it isn\'t special. It doesn\'t hog the limelight. Instead we catch fleeting glimpses, too scared to look at the horror. Of course this filming style is not new. But like ""Ryan"", no other movie has ever used this technique from start to finish with such intensity. Aisde from this ""eye"", the movie is actually pretty standard. Instead of children hiding from Raptors in cupboards, we have Cruise hiding from invaders in basements. Spielberg handles the tension well, but its all stuff you\'ve seen him and others do before.Like ""Jurassic Park"", the human drama is slight and the characters are never believable, but this is a popcorn movie and so we don\'t demand such things. That Spielberg quickly sketches relatively three dimensional characters in such brisk time is admirable. And of course there are numerous iconic set pieces. The night sequences in particular have a nightmarish quality and the first hour is very engaging. The film\'s big flaw, however, is it\'s final act. Tom Cruise battles a Tripod in silly a 1 on 1 showdown, before the plot slowly fizzles into nothingness. Spielberg also misfires by choosing to show the alien invaders. His aliens are unimaginative and badly designed. But what do you expect? Here\'s the guy who couldn\'t resist showing us inside the UFO in ""Close Encounters"". Sometimes too much imagination denotes a lack of imagination.The choice to ""show"" so much during the last act also goes against the aesthetic rules of the film. Early in the film, Robby runs up a hill yelling that he ""wants to see!"" the battle on the other side. ""I need to see this!"" he screams. His father holds him down and says ""I know it seems like you have to see this, but you don\'t!"" Meanwhile all around them, extras run about chanting ""turn around!"". Spielberg acknowledges that his camera is always ""turned around"", running from the creatures. The irony is that Spielberg, like Robby, isn\'t strong enough to hold himself back. By the final act, he loses strength and undoes all the brilliance he set up.Still, the camera work here is worthy of De Palma. I suspect within the next few years, everybody will be copying the style of this film. It will be interesting to see how Spielberg chooses to shoot his next movie.8/10 - Worth multiple viewings. Despite it\'s flaws, this is excellent popcorn fun. In the wake of 9/11 the film can also be read as another propagandistic Spielberg movie, America under attack by technologically advanced ""sleeper cell terrorists"" buried within the homeland and waiting to strike. Thank God Spielberg didn\'t put beards on his aliens.Note: People complain that the ""red blood"" sets at the end of the film are fake, but this is a homage to Menzies\' expressionistic work on ""Invaders from Mars"". Those who hate the fact that Cruise\'s son lives, should see ""The Mist"", Frank Darabond\'s brilliant re-imagining of Spielberg\'s film.', ""I'm a young fan of Steven Spielberg, and all his movies are wonderful and phenomenal. War of the Worlds (2005) is no exception. I don't know why it only got a 6.5/10 on IMDb. In my humble opinion, considering how intense and dramatic it was, it should've got a 7.0 minimum.But hey, if I like a movie, then reviews don't matter to me. Anyway, Steven Spielberg did it again with this bone-chilling, suspenseful, and INTIMIDATING movie. When you watch if, you feel as if you're a victim yourself of the Martians and their Tripods. They sealed a plan many years ago to destroy humanity and make our planet theirs. With their high-tech technology they can disintegrate a human- being in one nanosecond. What made this film excellent was the acting. Tom Cruise plays a divorced man who, in the end, is the one who saves the day despite an estranged relationship with his children. You can tell he wants to protect his family at all costs, even if it means the end of the world, Dakota Fanning, being only 10-11 in the film, did a PHENOMENAL and convincing job as a terrified, anxious and innocent little girl. I could feel her shock and hysteria. I don't know any girl her age at the time who could've done a better job. Spielberg did a successful job at giving the atmosphere a claustrophobic, impacting-doom feeling. No one is safe";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Studio Ghibli is just nonstop in terms of their animated quality (leaving most animated studios in the dust) even in times like the 90s when this film was released. The action sequences are crafted with such care and such brutality that it's hard not to be remarkably energized by them. The characters surrounding the movie are so engaging and iconic which immensely supports a deeply fleshed-out and powerfully thought-provoking story. Princess Mononoke is a breathtakingly painted tale of a man on a quest to balance two opposite ends of a war filled with hatred, greed, and violence. The conflict of siding between two teams is quite apparent in the film, and it's resolutions are as beautiful as they are significantly important in the real world throughout human history and especially today. (Verdict: A)"", ""I saw Mononoke Hime on its USA release back in late December 1999 under its U.S. title Princess Mononoke.  I had read quite a bit about this film and its director but was still totally overwhelmed by the beauty and brutality of this movie.  The complexity of this movie is something never seen in the United States in an animated movie and even exceeds that of most live action movies as well.  It combines love and hate, war and romance, nobility and deception in ways rarely seen in movies today.  Lines of good and evil are anything but clear cut and in the end is hope but no guarantees, no promises.  This is truly an adult movie but my children, ages 12 to 15 all loved it and talked about it for days later.

I hoped that the character played by Anamaria vartolomei wouldn't be as shallow a personality as in the film. That she had a more multifaceted personality like that of the Egyptian river.It's very unlikely that Haydee would fall in love with the son of the man who killed her father. She would choose to have an affair and marry the count, not only for his charm and intelligence, but for the money and power to be able to regain her social position as Cleopatra did when she was Julius Caesar's lover.The two had common goals and this made it easier for both of them to develop closeness and become lovers.Jim Caviziel's film is another nonsense about Albert, the count's son. As if Albert, being the count's son, was automatically a happy family. And this is a guarantee that father and son will be friends. See the story of Alexander the Great and his father Philip. Both had a relationship full of conflicts.The use of a mask and turning Count into a DC and Marvel character was stupid.The Count is not a hero, he just wants revenge. Just like Caesar, who with a fleet went to take revenge on the pirates who kidnapped him. Caesar was not a hero who hunted bandits, he just wanted to take revenge for his kidnapping, just like the count wanted to take revenge for his imprisonment.They are distorting the character and leaving him as a one-dimensional comic book hero.Types of action scenes like wock Wick and Batman are unreal. When you are going to take revenge, you seek help. When Julius Caesar went to avenge his kidnapping by pirates, he had the support of a fleet. When Mark Antony went to avenge Caesar's death, he had an army. The count is not a one-man army.

There's an elaborate, and very threatening fight in a bathroom near the beginning. There's also an elaborate chase involving helicopters over the Himalayas as a climax, complicated by the fact that Cruise can't simply kill the villain since he has to take the detonator he's carrying. Also there is an interesting, somewhat over elaborate car chase in Paris for the middle which is OK if not brilliant.Once again, the plot involves Ethan Hunt being accused, or framed of involvement in a terrorist conspiracy, and the only way he can clear his name involves giving the terrorists what they want. This plan goes badly wrong, and Hunt has to find a way to solve it. I know variations of this happened in movies 1 and 4, and if I cared enough about the plots, it may have happened in 2, 3 and 5.

Well, not for a minute did I think anyone believed old Tommy was in danger, in spite of doing the most craptacular stunts.Problems:1. When a character criticizes Tommy and says ""no one will fall for that trick"" and everyone in the audience knows what\'s going to happen next.2. What happens when a double cross double crosses the double crosser who double crosses the double double crosser because it needs to be done in order to double the double cross? 3. When Tom needs help from Hollywood, he gets it. Time slows down, high elevation becomes nothing more than a hit the ground and roll fall, the bad guys simply take their sweet merry time so that Tom can arrive... you name it. Every laughable exaggeration from old films made it into this one.4. The obsession with getting even with Ethan Hunt will distract everyone from their master plan. Hmmm.... so let\'s see the choice.... get away or get even with Ethan Hunt and potentially screw up all my perfect master plans which would kill Hunt anyway? The obsession must go on and Ethan must always win.The audience was laughing at this lazy tripe. These reviews are fake.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
John Wick: Chapter 2;2017;Action, Crime, Thriller;7.4;R;75;Chad Stahelski;Keanu Reeves, Riccardo Scamarcio, Ian McShane, Ruby Rose, Common, Claudia Gerini, Lance Reddick, Laurence Fishburne, Tobias Segal, John Leguizamo, Bridget Moynahan, Thomas Sadoski, Eric Frandsen, David Patrick Kelly, Perry Yung, Franco Nero, Youma Diakite, Peter Serafinowicz;After returning to the criminal underworld to repay a debt, John Wick discovers that a large bounty has been put on his life.;"['No doubt about it, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is a slick action thriller, but man, oh man, how can any one person absorb that kind of punishment? John (Keanu Reeves) gets shot, stabbed and hit by cars multiple times and postures a limp now and then to indicate he might have gotten just a little bit hurt. Besides that, he almost never makes a wrong move when hunted by dozens of assassins all at the same time. Okay, I get it, Reeves is the star of the picture and has to come out on top, but I\'d like a little more credibility put into these kinds of stories. But I guess that\'s the whole point, suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with all of the over the top action the film makers can put together.I do have to say that the opening scene of the brightly lit downtown Manhattan cityscape was about the finest cinematography you can hope to come up with just about anywhere. The picture maintained that same high level of consistency with the sleek settings and the richly detailed environs of The Continental. I also like the entire idea of this particular mob having a code that\'s inviolate, even for someone like Wick who crossed the line by taking out Santino D\'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) on Continental grounds. Ian McShane\'s Winston had a nice way of putting things in perspective for Wick to show him that the repercussions weren\'t going to be personal. After all, rules are rules.My favorite scene was the hit on Gianna D\'Antonio (Claudia Gerini), not so much for the bullet to her head, but for the way she took control to demonstrate she would die on her own terms and not her brother\'s. That was really quite a remarkable and original scene that makes the film more memorable for me than it otherwise might have been. Anyway, for a film with a cast of thousands who are either hit men or getting killed themselves, this is quite the adrenaline rush. Again, I emphasize that if that\'s what you want when you come to a picture like this, then Wick Two delivers in spades. And with the unequivocal ending, Wick 3 ought to escalate the body count exponentially.', ""I mean. This literally is what is says on the tin. It's jam packed with action and I love it.The plot is easy to understand and the action shots are brilliant. So much bloodshed, guns, fighting, killing and more guns. Did I mention guns?\nIt's just a nice, easy and fun watch. I recommend watching the first if you haven't already, but yeah I'm impressed by the sequel.Usually with action sequels it can be a bit dull and repetitive, but this ramps up the action from the first film.But yeah, 8/10 from me today. Enjoyed my time watching this, I'm going to jump into the third one now."", ""Iosef's uncle still has John Wick's car. Wick comes after it and the uncle accepts his offer of peace. He hopes to return to his peaceful retirement but crime lord Santino D'Antonio calls in his Marker. He faces deadly assassins, numerous killers, and countless thugs as Santino uses him to gain power even offering a $7 million contract.Gun Fu is loads of fun and the addition of Pencil Fu is glorious. What makes the original great is the simple, powerful, and poetic motivation of John Wick. The sequel could not possibly repeat that. They can't kill off another dog. This one delivers what it could. Keanu Reeves remains the same and there is more fighting. The plot is almost meaningless. It is all action and all Wick."", ""Its like you have second date with a girl, you don't want to lose, so next you take her somewhere better, more expensive, but the girl wants to be comfy and not to feel, you want impress her with the money and place. Yes, chapter II is in the same waters like first part. But in this movie, there are some bit boring sequences like that with Fishburne and maybe more for some individuals. Actions sequences here are beautifully done, story is basic and finale is adequate. all of this is dona by the same formula. Only ONE BETTER thing for me is characters. Thanks to larger scale, there are new players and are pretty good to watch. Non-talking woman and Common - both are very very watchable and add new dimensions. They are more attractive than (still very good) Dafoe in first part. I am music man but i don't remember any catchy hook or loop in terms of soundtrack. Little bit sad from directing the end. SPOILER: When Wick is running away in very last shot, the angle of camera should have been closely to his face, not to take large scale. It would be much better and more dramatic if we could some expressions in his face, like for the first time - fear for example... END of SPOILER: Overall - funny to watch, classy, more expensive."", ""To put it simply, the movie is fascinating, exciting and fantastic. The dialog, the fight choreography, the way the story moves, the characters charisma, all and much more are combined together to deliver this masterpiece. Such an amazing flow, providing a fusion between the 90s and the new century, it's like the assassins are living in another world, with another mindset, without people understanding it. Just one advice for you though: Don't build an expectation of what you want to watch in this movie, if you do, then you will ruin it. This movie has it's own flow and movement, so watch it with a clear mind, and have fun."", 'I feel like the pacing of this Superhero (mythos) meets Gangster (generic noir) setting is way better than John Wick 1.The cinematography, the combat, everything, except the casting (although the performances are great) works for me.They shot this in some of the most notable, scenic places in western culture, and I feel like the world they create, and expand upon from the first, is the best part. It takes a lot of what works about cyberpunk and contemporizes it.', 'I have to say after seeing ""John Wick"" in the cinema almost 3 years ago I had high expectations on the sequel. I have watched the first part about three more times now and it never became boring. My fear for this sequel was that they couldn\'t get a good start into the new story. With a few similarities that chapter 2 shared with first one this could have been a huge let down. But god damn... this movie started strong and oddly enough it started in a way that I didn\'t even think about. I wouldn\'t say that the scenes were predictable just because they were so different from all the other action movies I have seen. This movie remains serious, whilst brilliantly combining dry humor with extreme graphic and violent images. If you have watched this movie you will remember this one scene... this one scene that you just can not get out of your head sheer to it\'s immense (and freaking awesome) brutality. ""John Wick Chapter 2"" is like a ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" that even though being funny, manages to stay serious throughout the entire 2 hours. It doesn\'t seem too long nor too short and strikes a good balance between action sequences and story telling. In comparison to the first one though Chapter 2 does not seem as realistic. John Wick was a killer I thought could actually exist in real life after watching the first movie. That was the reason I and I think many other loved that film so much. Chapter 2 does lose some of it\'s credibility due to a few action sequences. Remember, I am not talking about a Fast and Furious like action scene here. This is criticism on a whole new level. ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" went beyond my expectations and is in my opinion better than the first one. Go watch this movie in the cinema if you liked the part one. If you haven\'t seen the prequel I would recommend you to catch up just because it\'s so good. Though it is not actually necessary to follow and enjoy the story of Chapter 2. I hope this review was helpful to some of you who couldn\'t decide whether to watch this film in the cinema or wait for the Blu-Ray and DVD release. Go to the cinema your money will be spend wisely. 8/10', 'Adding to his earlier Wickipedia page with a significant increase in body count contribution, not including the injured and\\or maimed, although he was not as irked as on his previous visit because the rage was more professional than personal: I fancy he can go one, excuse me, considerably better, next time.', ""I am retired at 41 years old and watch movies all day and night. I take my action films very serious.. From Die Hard to District 13, from First Blood to Taken... John Wick 2 is one of the best action movies I've seen. Simply put.. on a scale of the good old 80's red blooded American action films, John Wick 1 will draw you in and make you a fan, John Wick 2 will satisfy your soul with the 2017 evolution of 80's action with a feeling of have hit the gritty lotto. This is a man's man film that should be enjoyed after a hearty steak dinner (as I did tonight). I may have to go see this again."", ""In this 2nd installment of John Wick, the stylish visual and hard core action returns twice the level of the first film. So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film. The ending of this film opened the possibility of many more franchise of this movie."", ""Keanu Reeves is reunited with his Matrix master, Laurence Fishburne in this sequel. It was nice to see them as allies.Meanwhile, there is endless murder and mayhem as all hell breaks loose when Wick is the target of revenge and a seven million dollar bounty on his head. There is a lot more action in this sequel, and less melancholy memories of Wick's dead wife. Now it is just Wick killing everyone that looks at him funny, and enjoying the bloodshed."", ""I really loved the first movie, although I feel that this one missed the mark slightly.Firstly, the storyline was less clear this time round, so I wasn't fully on board with John's motive and what was driving him. I felt less invested in him going out and beating everyone up (Whereas in the first movie I was really rooting for him).There were also a lot of parts that were illogical, and I often found myself questioning why someone did X when it would have been easier for them to do Y. It happened enough times for it to ruin the storyline for me.I think it was an okay movie, with some great scenes. But as a whole, it didn't come together for me and I was pretty bored."", ""This movie is pretty good, the action is good and the story is kind of engaging, but compared to the first one it severely lacks the character development, story and the intensity provided by the first one, and even knowing that the action in this one is good, nothing comes close to the brilliance from the club scene or the bunker fight, it's ok as a movie but compared to the first one, it severely lacks. Hopefully Parabellum will bring back the things that made John wick amazing"", ""John Wick 2 is a great sequel that wasn't underwhelming it produced great action scenes great performances and there wasn't a dull moment in sight, its more fast paced than the first but all in good favor, Keanu Reeves gives it his all and adds a lot to these movies I'm hopeful that this continues on to be a great franchise, we got are first peek into the mob underworld in the first movie and in this movie its more fleshed and we get to know more about wick as the story progresses as I said it adds more to the story in every aspect which is to be praised. I also believe that the action set pieces in this movie topped its predecessor with stunts where you tilt your head in amazement. Only negatives sometimes the movie doesn't take time to stop and let you have a breather but otherwise its a very impressive movie with great acting, story and action sequences. JOHN WICK YOUR NOT VERY GOOD AT RETIRING!!"", ""This movie got more money than the first one and it didn't got wasted. The movie looked gorgeously. John Wick was a badass again and he kicked some ass. I liked that John Wick had new cool memorable phrases and his stunts were incredible. I heard that he done about 90 % of them by himself and that really proves that he puts a lot of work in his job Keanu was really good in this movie. The movie shows more about assassins life and about their rules and that was awesome to see I am glad that director listened to the fans. Because of this deeper insight in assassins, better visual looking, awesome action sequences its safe to say that this was better than the first one of course the first one was good also I gave it 7 and this one gets 8.After all I really recommend you to watch this is one of the better movies this year so far."", ""Sin 1: Tossing out established canon.The coolest bit of lore about the first movie is completely lost in the sequel. That alone is a sin you cannot redeem yourself for. In the original, it was established canon that John Wick was not a man to mess with. Even the main villain, respected and feared his abilities.In John Wick 2, however, all of that is gone. Nobody fears John Wick. Nobody is afraid to take him on. His past deeds and reputation mean absolutely squat.The new villain, never thinks twice about double crossing Wick. Every hit-man on the planet, and according to this movie they are every where, has no qualms about trying to take Wick out.Sin 2: No main character growth In the first movie, we travel along with Wick as he avenges his dog and in the end moves forward with his grief. The video of his wife tells him to get up and move on. In John Wick 2, there is zero character growth. He is no different at the end of the movie as he is when it starts. Sure his circumstances have been altered, but as a character he has overcome nothing. That makes for a boring story.Sin 3: Weak plot The original movie had a simple, but strong plot. Revenge. The plot of the sequel is weak, even by action movie standards. Wick has been called into service to kill a criminal, if he refuses he dies... but wait if he accepts, he also dies. The whole movie could have started and ended with the original premise of refusing the contract. It would have made more sense to refuse the contract and fight off the baddies coming to enforce the blood oath.Sin 4: Video Game Bad Guys Wow. There is evidently a plethora of John Wick cannon fodder. They just keep coming, and there really is no logical reason why they do. The body count is so high that it becomes comical. The original had a big body count, but it was divided among 5 big action scenes and, for an action movie, seemed plausible. This one doubles the body count but there are so many, the coolness of each kill is lost in an over abundance of victims.Sin 5: Invincible Superhero Hit by two cars, stabbed and shot numerous times and he just keeps on going. Must be seeing the doctor and getting pain pills, right? Nope no doctors in this one. That kind of logical realism may interfere with the killing of cardboard bad guys. At one point a fellow assassin, holds a pistol point blank in Wick's abdomen and fires a couple shots through him. No biggie Wick has another 42 bad guys to kill.Sin 6: James Bond Gadgets I love the Continental, don't get me wrong, but the secret underground hit-man hosting hotel just goes too far in this one. Bulletproof suit coats that can be held up like Batman's cape to shield yourself from bullets? Silencers so quiet that two adversaries can have a shootout in a subway between bystanders and nobody knows even though bullet holes are being blasted into the walls around them? Sin 7: Shallow Villains Yes there are the 140 plus cardboard video game baddies, but in the first John Wick, the main villain had a moral dilemma: turn over his son to save his own butt. The bad guys in Wick 2 have no interesting character motivation or dilemmas. The closest you get is Common's desire for revenge after Wick kills his client. And that was the most interesting bad guy on the screen. It is hard to believe the two movies were written by the same folks.Sin 8: Soundtrack John Wick 1 had an unbelievable soundtrack that actually set the mood as he moved through the action scenes and the emotional scenes. This soundtrack just plain sucks. There is nothing memorable in it, and it does little to impart any emotion on a given scene.Sin 9: Pacing Even the big action scenes in this movie are too long. In their desire to up the body count they went with longer action sequences. It really messes with the pace of the film. The first movie did a great job of dividing the action and keeping the viewer engaged. The longer these scenes go, the less believable they became which pulls the audience out of the moment.Sin 10: Rehashing things that worked in the first movie There are some great scenes in the first Wick, and the director knew that so they tried to repeat them. This is a classic sequel mistake and unfortunately Wick 2 falls victim to this trope. You liked the interaction with Jimmy? We will get another one in there. Like the reload and kill? We will put a twist on that one also. It was great to see the pencil kills, that is how it should be done. Don't show us the same thing but different. Show us new, that may have been mentioned previously.Making the next sequel look better then this one. The end of this movie sets up a very interesting plot for a third movie and almost everyone that walked out was excited to see it. That is wonderful, except when that movie actually sounds more interesting then the one you just watched. You should have just made that movie instead.All in all Wick 2 falls short of the first one. Once again we are treated to an amazing movie whose sequel just doesn't capture the magic of the first one. I'm looking at you Red 2, Donnie Darko 2, Matrix 2, etc...""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Of course whats missing is some really good music but hey, we heard worse, right', 'Seven is the magic number. A ""seven"" rating for a somewhat underwhelming movie. The gun fights were well executed and the cast as good as advertised. It\'s the story that lagged. The team assembling so quickly and their rationales for doing so are near nonsensical and shallow. Also, PC Hollywood rearing its head was noticeable and irritating. Casting the lead as a black man was absolutely fine (especially given a superb talent like Denzel Washington) and actually added to the narrative but adding an Indian, Asian and Mexican to the team for good measure seemed tacked on and forced to a silly degree. Making sure ALL the white men suffer a bad fate before the end of the movie adds to the ""white man guilt"" Hollywood is so keen on promoting nowadays. At the end of the day, the movie is mostly unremarkable save for some intense gun battle scenes.', ""They walk pass a flag waving in the wind near the mining camp.. problem is it's a modern day 50 star flag and this is suppose to be the 19th century??"", 'I love Denzel Washington as an actor, and I enjoyed that they diversified the cast in this version. The character of hawke was quite interesting. But making the sharpshooter a guy that can no longer shoot, why? It was a fun movie , and I liked that they included a Native American and an Asian. But at the end, they killed all the white characters. That was not missed by me. These hidden messages really annoy me.', ""Good movie, but certainly not great. The cast are tremendous actors, but IMO Vincent D'Onofrio was the star of the show...fantastic acting on his part. Of course, Denzel Washington was a good main character, however, unbelievable given that historically, the west was populated largely by people of Caucasion and Mexican descent. I feel that the casting of mostly minorities was another pathetic attempt at re-writing history with a broad, multi-colored and politically correct brush that is all too common today. This movie largely lacked character development and I wished there was more substance to the film. What can I say? Like many other movies released in the last 10 years, it had plenty of action and fast-moving scenes, but fell short of becoming something memorable. In the end, the script reminded me of the classic A- Team episode, except this team sports cowboy hats and six- shooters."", 'The original is still considered a top 5 western of all time, so why mess with that? It\'s opening night of this movie in a half full theater, and from the number of one liners that only got a few laughs from the two elderly ladies a few rows back, to the cliché action sequences ripped off of other great westerns, my eyes are sore from how much they rolled over 140mins. The writing was as lousy as the directing in my opinion. The dialogue looked amateur compared to what was delivered in something like ""Tombstone"". Poor Vincent D\'Onofrio was using some ridiculous voice that he could hardly deliver the lines in, and *spoiler alert* his death was over dramatic and CHEESY!!! Good guys and bad guys dropping like flies from bullets, but Chris Pratt rides in o ten(?) men firing at him, sustains at least six bullets before falling... he has just enough strength to muster trying to light a smoke, and light some dynamite with a casual trouble free grin -- CHEESY! And then to top it all off, let\'s add in a few native Americans in nice clean clothes that look straight off the shelf from the local trading post - navy blue felt was it? What, did they run out of money on wardrobe? The lines, the Indian war cries, and the native vs native fight was insulting in my opinion.So, what did Hollywood accomplish with this? Antoine Fuqua\'s took a top western and destroyed it. When the current generation hears of ""The Magnificent Seven"", they will remember a garbage film and that\'s what people will remember -- well done.', ""My only critique is with the Emma character. She's supposedly a pioneering woman...tough no-nonsense. But her dress says otherwise. Off the shoulder, low cut? Not the reality of the day at that time. If y'all wanted sexy keep it authentic...not contrived out of Hollywood!"", 'The third American remake of Akira Kurosawa\'s Seven Samurai. It has a great deal of the same issues but they are exacerbated in this third iteration. This movie of the three has weakest storytelling but some of the best action, but it doesn\'t feel like a western. And it isn\'t quite an action movie instead it is this kind of middle ground that just makes the movie feel lost and out of place. And that is one of the over arching issues with this movie, it doesn\'t know what it wants to be.*LIGHT SPOILERS BELOW*Everyone besides Denzel Washington has no motivation. The big bad guy an evil corporate industrialist (who honestly gains nothing by destroying the town...he has the mine rights already and would greatly benefit from having a town nearby) decides to destroy the town, murder half the inhabitants and set the church on fire in the first 5 min...just so you know he is evil. Chris Pratt\'s character Faraday is motivated to get his horse back and an obscure promise of some payout. But he realizes early on that he has his horse back and the payout isn\'t that much, so he kind of stays and dies for no reason. Ethen Hawke\'s ""Goodnight"" and Byung-hun Lee\'s ""Billie"" show up because Denzel asked nicely (again no talk of a payout). And this repeats itself with the rest of the characters, (except for the good Comanche Indian Denzel ate a raw deer liver so they became be-sties). And it gets worse because all the magnificent seven are the same stereotypes you have seen in Hollywood since the 70\'s. Mountain Man into Jesus, Noble Indian Savage, Mexican Bandit, Confederate Soldier with PTSD, Gambling Cowboy, token woman that can shoot, Asain samurai with a pistol, and the only real character Denzel Washington as Chisolm. The action in this movie is however fast paced and over the top...Think of a western ""SHOOT EM UP"" and you have it. They do not use the traditional idea of western movies that build up the tension over the course of a movie. It is suddenly, Chris Pratt kills 8 bad guys in 15 seconds. Billie (the samurai gunslinger) runs in the open and stabs 4 cowboys with knives (despite having two pistols), and Mountain Man tackles a horse (despite having a pistol, rifle, tomahawk, knife etc). It is cool to watch but will have you at moments go WTF.If you think about the story you will have a bad time. If you want realistic western action you will have a bad time. If you want a mediocre action movie that takes place in a western town, this could be worth a shot but only if you watch during a matinée. It doesn\'t hold a candle to the original (1960). But it does have better action than the 1998 one...but the story is worse. So it is basically on the same level as the made to TV movie.', 'Maybe magnificent seven 2016 isnt close to be as good as original western but compared to many remakes and reboots of previous years,i must say that this film puts a dose of respect on its name and legacy,maybe that is becase fuqua give a very good direction and actors expecely denzel all give very enterteining performances ,cast and characters from 60s film is maybe more memorable and iconic but younger stars in this film proved that they can act,magnificent seven was a enterteining western and even if it is nothing new in genre it still took some old staff and put it in a modern world with a respect to source material and reminder that westerns arent dead yet']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Alita: Battle Angel is my type of movie. I love the science fiction and the great action throughout the entire movie. It also has a very substantive story as a solid foundation. The setting is very grim but Alita's character is uplifting and gives viewers hope. I liked how Alita's story also involves a quest of finding out who she truly is. She finds herself in a world where she can be seen as somewhat ordinary. But she comes to find out that she's far from ordinary. She's an angel from heaven. I really enjoyed this movie and the story itself can be explained further in other films. I hope there's a sequel as the ending laid the framework for more films.

Overall the movie started very promising and was progressing fine until the story got sloppy and fall into very cheap film flows, the kind of stuff you see in cheap karate movies. And the ending couldn't be less disappointing by leaving the obvious expectation for a sequel - really? A whole new movie for climbing up the pipe to get to the bad guy?

Like the boy says about her, she may be cgi, but she is the most human feeling in the entire movie. With that said, the same boy either had bad acting or bad lines, or both. I expected a much different story from the title ""Battle Angel"". By that I mean I did not expect the roller derby subplot, or the get to the prestigious sky city climax. I guess I was expecting a war story. I came into this movie unfamiliar with the anime so I really didn\'t know what to expect. I was told to see Alita instead of captain marvel because it\'s a much better character and story, and I must agree. I saw both. There wasn\'t much of a climax so it slightly fizzled at the end but it really left it open for sequels which is what they were obviously going for. I hate to say this, because I\'m against the transhumanist cyborg agenda being pushed on society (take notice all the robot commercials in the last super bowl) but I fell in love with Alita, and you will too.', ""I've always loved Anime, and it's always been frustrating watching Hollywood movies destroy it (Ghost in the shell). Alita however did an amazing job in fusing Hollywood and Anime. I believe it was a great story adaptation by James Cameron, breathtaking action scenes and directing by Rodriguez, and great casting. I saw this in 4DX 3D in Seoul and It was a roller coaster ride. I was afraid the movie might put me to sleep, but it kept me engaged and watching from beginning to end. I think the most important element for movies should be the ability to engage the audience and never let them go until the very end. This movie delivers. And also I am very proud of Director Rodriguez for taking on this enormous task. He put a lot on the line to make this film.\nAn interesting thing I found was for some reason I felt there were elements of John Carpenter here.\nOverall one of the best 3D films made so far. I believe the bar has been pushed higher for all filmmakers. A must watch in 3D exerpience!"", 'Marvelous effect with some great actions make this movie not to be missed seeing it in the big screen. But the thing I love the most is Alita herself. There were a few times I had a smile on myself watching Alita as she was so loveable and badass.\nReally really hope it will goes beyond just this one movie as the world building in Alita was so fascinating and of course, need to see more Alita.', ""I went to Flame Tower's cinema to watch this movie. It was the only cinema in Baku that showed films in English (in the original language). I didn't have much expectation from the movie. But I enjoyed the movie a lot. It was a good and fun movie."", ""But the romance threw us off a bit. But this is way much better than Ghost in the Shell and Ready player one.\nThe story was amazing, made sense, didn't jump from one element to another and the pasting was perfect. The visuals are stunning! Absolutely 10/10. But the romance...everyone in the cinema giggled when Hugo died, it just didn't work, nobody cared about the character anyway. He was simply there to have a love interest for Alita.\nSumming it up, definitely worth watching, looking forward for the next one!"", ""Alita battle angel is pretty amazing, visually, the movie is a marvel to watch, the special effects are some of the best ever, the set design, art direction is all on par, to make this world fill alive, and it does.\nThe acting is pretty amazing by Rosa Salazar part, giving alita a really great personality, Christopher waltz, mahershalla Ali, and Jennifer Connolly are pretty good in the fim also, just the actor whom played Hugo, didn't convince me enough\nThe script is really good and tight, giving everyone a good backstory, and reasons for their actions, sometimes the exposition is kind of heavy, but it makes us understand the races and classes present in this alternate universe.\nI was exited for this film, but spectical at the same time, but I did not left disappointed. It did not surpassed my expectations, but it was an amazing time at the cinema."", ""My biggest issue is that there is no clear plot and nothing actually happens. One minute it's about becoming a bounty hunter, then we're trying to go to a city in the sky and the next thing everyone's enjoying roller derby.

The New Mutants is 20th Century Fox\'s final nail in the coffin for it\'s X-men related films. Everything to follow The New Mutants will be directly produced by Disney/Marvel and incorporated into the MCU over time. This is good as it will allow Marvel to finally correct all the issues with the X-men\'s fractured timelines and convoluted films. For those who don\'t know, The New Mutants was Marvel\'s precursor to X-Force which is originally led by Cable, the anti-hero introduced in Deadpool 2.However, instead of a standard superhero origin story like Spiderman or X-Men, The New Mutants began it\'s story in a world where mutants already exist, and apparently have existed for some time. While it\'s not directly linked to the X-men or Deadpool films, atleast not on the surface, it does mention the fact that the X-men and Professor X do exist in this world and are an active superhero team. All the characters are canon original members of what would later become X-Force, except for Magik, Illyana Rasputin. According to Marvel lore, she\'s the sister of Colossus, the large metal X-man featured in Deadpool and Deadpool 2, though she never even mentions that he exists. These kids....the ""new mutants""......Magik, Cannonball,Wolfsbane, Sunspot, and Mirage, find themselves trapped in high security institution, which is so high security that it let\'s them walk around freely as long as they don\'t leave the premises. Each day they attend sessions with their handler, a mysterious woman named Dr. Cecilia Reyes, who\'s job is to help them learn to harness and control their powers. Throughout the film there is a foreboding sense that things aren\'t what they seem. Little by little the teens discover evidence that make them question why they\'re there and draw questions about the motives of their handler. Initially they believe that they\'re being prepared to join the X-men but is that why they\'re really there? Things come to a head when they begin to ask questions and seek answers on their own leading to an action-packed battle between good and evil.In terms of the greater X-men films, this is a nice change from all of the time travel, multiple versions of multiple characters thing that has so deeply destroyed the X-men series. However, among the X-films, it\'s not one of the good ones. It\'s not one of the worst either. I saved that place for Apocalypse until Dark Phoenix beat it.Nevertheless, I appreciate it\'s choice to step away from traditional costumed superhero action and attempt to tell a much darker story in the same film universe. I just wish it was executed better. The honest truth is that if you never read any of the comicbooks like I have, and have only seen the other X-men films, you would have no idea who these people are or why you should care about them. Their characters are unfortunately not developed well at all. Viewers won\'t know anything about them";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

At the hands of Dr. No, he doesn't play the pia, pia, piano."", 'In honor of the upcoming 25th James Bond film, ""No time to Die"", I\'ve decided to rewatch and review all the films from the official canon. The first film, ""Dr. No"" (1962) has been relatively low on my list of favorite Bond films because it\'s not as big and fun as the later installments. Rewatching it today, I enjoyed it very much-it was just as exhilarating as any of the Bond films. While there are many dated elements and flaws that are visible from a contemporary viewer-in particular the use of the rear screen projection and dubbing, there are many subtle moments which are brilliant. One example is the briefing scene in M\'s office. When M takes out his pipe, Bond offers his lighter to light it. However, M stands up and moves away, lighting it himself. I felt that this established M\'s stern nature against Bond. Another motif that was prominent but not overtly portrayed was the British-American rivalry. In this film, Felix Leiter (played by Jack Lord) is introduced as a foil rather than the ally we see in the later films. He and Quarrel (played by John Kitzmiller) are portrayed as relatively incompetent compared to Bond, the British agent. Leiter even uses the term ""Limey"" in one of the earlier scenes. When Bond and Quarrel are sailing to Crab Key, Leiter offers to go but the British agent claims that this is ""his beat"" and that the Americans can come later. This sentiment was more prominent in the novels, and obviously due to it\'s subsequent success in the US it completely disappeared. Sean Connery is spectacular as always. I thought his verbal confrontation with Dr. No was his best acting. Scenes involving Bond escaping from his prison cell in Dr. No\'s lair, using his wits still holds up very well today. The score, while overusing the title theme a little too much, was good especially in the climatic scenes of the film. Overall, it\'s definitely one of the best in the series for a good reason.', 'Though countless have taken on the role, James Bond will always be Sean Connery.', ""The first movie of James bond cannon... What a start!The movie is very good in terms of visuals,acting,cinematography and musical score.The plot might be a little feeble but its execution is quite good.The film maintains its pace nicely.The runtime is also OK.The climax is a little doddering.The plot also contains some minor flaws but they are quickly overcome by its fast pace and the amazing storytelling ability of Terence Young. Sean looks amazing.He must have been a heartthrob during his age.His charismatic look and flamboyant personality mixed with his amazing panache is impeccable.He is a perfect choice for the role and no one other than him could have played this act so admirably.Ursula never looked so attractive.Joseph Wiseman's role was a little puny.I expected him to be more stronger.Yet him calm and wise voice was fit for his role of a evil genius. Cinematogrphy is awesome.The camera captures the vibrant and picturesque surrounding brilliantly.The visuals are good.The light hearted tone and good one liners are another positive points for the film. A nice movie and a must watch for the Bond lovers.The start of this brilliant Spy saga is not to be missed. 6.8 out of 10 is my final rating."", ""I have trouble enjoying most of the James Bond films because I also read the books. The original Ian Fleming books generally had nothing to do with the films other than the title and the books also differed in many ways concerning Bond--his style, his personality and mission. Bond was NOT a love 'em and leave 'em guy in the books. Sure, he slept with some women, but he was far less randy and was more of a cold-blooded character. While Bond is too suave and nice in this film, he was closer to the real Bond than any of the subsequent Sean Connery movies. As far as the plot goes, this film was also much closer to the original source material--though Dr. No was NOT operating a nuclear base and his ending was far less exciting in the book (believe it or not, he was crushed to death by a load of guano in the Fleming story).In addition to being more faithful, I also liked this Bond because this is the only time I can remember Bond actually killing someone in cold-blood. In the wonderful bedroom scene, he COULD have let the would-be murderer go, but instead took pleasure in playing with his victim like a cat playing with a mouse. It may just be one of the best Bond scenes ever.Something else that really stood out for the better in this film was Jack Lord as the first of many Felix Leiters. Oddly, in each film, a different guy played this CIA man. I don't know why they didn't try to keep a consistent actor for the role, but I bet they didn't use Lord again because I am sure many ladies in the audience thought he was better looking than Connery--something that might distract from his movie image. If you don't believe me, look at the later Leiters--all rather homely or non-distinctive. Oddly, one, from THUNDERBALL, looked a bit like Danno from Hawaii 5-0--but he was given so little screen time that there wasn't a chance to steal any of Connery's glory.All in all, there was very little not to like in this action-packed but more believable Bond film. Sure, it was different from the book, but this is one case where I think this actually wasn't a problem--the way the book ended was pretty anticlimactic. See this and you've seen the best Sean Connery Bond film, as it's intelligently written and rather free of the usual silly gadgetry."", ""The year was 1962 and the world's longest running movie franchise was kickstarted with this great Bond movie. It provided a formula which future Bond movies were to follow, even to this day. Beautful Women,great action and a super villain. Adapted from the famous Ian Flemming novel of the same name it tells the story of a famous spy who goes to investigate the disappearance of a fellow spy. Sean Connery was perfect as the suave spy James Bond. Ursula Andress was rather good too, in fact being a guy she provided the biggest highlight for me. That famous bikini sequence(later copied in DAD) still does not disappoint, even after 47 years. Joseph Wiseman was great as super villain Dr No. After not having seen it for years, a couple of weeks I watched it again when a TV channel was showing it. After watching it I can safely say it still provides great entertainment and packs a almighty punch. Though not quite as FRWL or even Goldfinger(my personal favourite Bond movie)it is still a pretty good movie and it is fun for fans to sit down and watch the Bond movie franchise in it's prime.

It's like they kept the budget for the big finale but there isn't a lot of Dinosaurs in this, so if you're going with tye expectations of seeing a lot of Dinosaurs you won't get it.

From the early part of the movie, you feel like something powerful and dangerous is lurking around and is going to jump out on you at any moment. Ever-multiplying questions tease your brain and a suspense is building up at the back of your mind right up to the end of the story. The acting was very convincing and drawing although the movie suffers from its mediocre ending. A few times I felt that the logic and the flow of the plot were a bit unrealistic and artificial. I wish that the story was focused more on the mystery and the children's reactions without all the insignificant distractions and one-dimensional minor characters. After being disappointed by a series of recent movies, this one was refreshing and heart-fluttering. It flings us back to the adventure-seeking and truth-chasing time of our childhood.

I am simply someone who loves going to the movies and have seen more than I can count. I was waiting for Super 8 for about 6 months. I saw the early trailers, was involved in the viral campaigns. I was amped to go and experience another great JJ Abrams film.Like many reviewers I started on a high then at about half way my opinion of the movie had gone down a lot.I watch a lot of movies and like to think I know a good movie when I see one. For me it's simple. Was it interesting? Was it entertaining? Was it original? This is what makes a great movie to me. Super 8 was not a great movie.The best way to describe Super 8 is take ET and put it in a blender with Cloverfield. But it just doesn't feel like it blended how it should have.The are too main stories...little kids having adventures, growing up and falling in love. Other the other side a monster attacks the city cloverfield style. The kid parts are filmed in a very ET 80's cinemas style. The alien parts are modern with CGI and at times it honestly doesn't feel like you are watching the same film.Don't even get me started on inconsistencies of this movie... like a man driving into a speeding train derailing it and SURVIVING? Lol... seriously?Super 8 feels very much like a fan made dedication to Spielberg but it just didn't quite work.I will say the kids were excellent actors and I would have been more entertained just watching a movie about them with no alien. Elle Fanning out acted every one, even the adult cast. She proved to be an amazing young actress portraying a maturity far beyond her age. But with the other characters I had no real emotional attachment to them. I didn't feel sorry for the alien, was I supposed to?Like I said I am simply a movie buff and to me this was not anything special. I'm surprised by all these 10/10 reviews, because this movie had nothing new that you haven't seen in 50 other films. I think it would have made 2 great separate films, where they could have taken their time to build the story. Combined though I would say wait for DVD."", ""As an homage to the Spielberg films of the 80's, this movie succeeds. As a piece of original entertainment? Nothing happening, folks. Now, if you're a kid and have never seen The Goonies, Jaws, ET, War of the Worlds, and Cloverfield, you may think this film is absolutely wonderful. And judged through the lens of cinema history, it may well be looked upon as a culmination of all that came before.Let's just hope that the future is filled with something in rare supply: originality.It's not that I wasn't entertained, it's just that I expected something more.And I suppose that's another problem with getting older. There aren't as many surprises left in the world."", ""Look, I'm biased. When I first saw the movie in 2011 while I was still just in middle school, I was enamored. Now, 8 years later, as a film student inspired by this movie, I can honestly say that it still holds up. A lot of the love I have for this movie is purely fueled by nostalgia, but even aside from that, the thrills and heartstring tugs this movie delivers still stand up to the test of time so far. This movie is always going to mean the world to me, and I hope someone out there sees this and gives it a shot. It's so criminally underrated and under-appreciated."", ""I really wanted to love this movie. Having grown up in the 80's blessed with so many classic Spielberg movies the thought him making one with JJ Abrahams was tantalizing. Unfortunately, it seems that by working together they have simply produced a compilation of all there best ideas which when put together into an entire movie simply don't wash. There were so many ideas taken from past Spielberg movies, Jaws, Close encounters, ET just to name a few. Then into to the mix comes JJ with his Lost / Cloverfield (which I love) mystery monster adult story. The result is a continued battle between a touching, funny, kids Spielberg movie with a confusing, alien monster that kills soldiers and has unbelievable power which as the story unfolds becomes absurd as to how the Army ever had control of it in the first place. This simply did not at up at all! To keep it simple these two movie styles should be kept separate. When they are combined together there is not enough of either to satisfy. Through the majority of the movie I just sat there thinking I've seen this before, I know what's going to happen next, it was better in the eighties. Cloverfield was far better, The Goonies was a classic, ET was a classic, Close Encounters was a classic, Jaws was a classic. This unfortunately was not!"", ""Super 8 is J.J. Abrams' ultimate tribute to the films that defined executive producer Steven Spielberg's career around the same time in which the movie is set, back in 1979. It contains elements of Jaws, The Goonies, E.T and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, while also working in later favourites like Jurassic Park. But you know this already, mostly because everyone in the media discussing this film seems to be falling over themselves to remind you of how good Spielberg is. While I don't dispute this, Super 8 is Abrams' child, so without further ado, let's see what he can bring to the table.When young Joel and his friends meet at a railway station one night to film a scene for their amateur zombie movie, they're shocked to see a car drive onto the train tracks, causing the spectacular derailment of an oncoming train we later learn was transporting top secret exhibits from Area 51. A creature not of this world manages to escape from its holding carriage, and over the next few weeks the residents of Lillian can't understand why their dogs have all fled the county, and why so many electrical appliances have gone missing.The film is shot in a unique fashion, using a semi-sepia tone that, at times, is reminiscent of Gordon Willis' cinematography in the Godfather trilogy. Abrams includes the deliberate use of lens flare (the shining lines you sometimes get when pointing a camera at a bright light), which serves a self-reflexive purpose but can get a little irritating. The setting has been recreated beautifully, with everything from the clothes to the cars to the music contributing to the cultural landscape that was late '70s rural America.Given the subject matter, this film certainly could have been a lot worse. What it ends up being is a slightly above-average monster movie that, for the most part, seems to ignore the fact that a monster is on the loose. How does that even make sense? Well, a big part of it is the interplay between the talented cast of completely unknown child actors, who play off a good script and show maturity in their ability to portray interpersonal hardship that one wouldn't normally associate with this genre.The film deals with themes such as family, jealousy and friendship, and it is truly a breath of fresh air to see a mainstream movie apply some well-structured character development in a genre that has recently been plagued with nothing but cardboard cut-outs of protagonists (see: Cloverfield, Skyline and Battle LA). Let me put it this way: if you get rid of the monster, and put a touch more thought into each character's persona, Super 8 could easily pass off as an Oscar-baiting, coming-of-age drama about a boy learning to let loved ones back into his life following the traumatic death of his mother. It is ironic, then, that the movie slips into mundane and predictable territory as soon as the monster becomes the focal point in the Final Act. All these complex and engaging relationships we've seen build between the kids take a back seat in the final half-hour, in place of a climax that lacks originality and, quite frankly, tries to be too emotional for its own good, to the point of becoming sappy. Without giving too much away, Abrams tries to humanise the creature by comparing its plight to that of Joel, and the comparison is hammered home with such ferocity (using both imagery and dialogue) as if to imply we didn't get it the first three times. Finally, I could have gone without the delayed reveal of the monster. I find that film technique rather dated and didn't really build up as much suspense as expected. That, and the fact that when the monster is shown in its entirety, it isn't exactly the biggest payoff in movie history. As with every movie that surpasses the halfway point of my ratings system, I will recommend it, just not with the same gusto that I hoped I'd have.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"", 'Super 8, derivative and disappointing at its best, can be summarized using elements from the other sci-fi/thrillers that Spielberg either directed, produced, or exec-produced.Some annoying kids find a map (Goonies) – including a fat kid who likes to eat (Goonies) – and they come up against the military which is trying to track down an alien on the loose (E.T.).The creature has created issues for the townsfolk who express concern at a meeting with the sheriff (Jaws) and they eventually have to evacuate because of a made-up disaster (Close Encounters).The alien, who is a really a spider (Arachnaphobia) that has been collecting items so that he can get home (E.T.), has the ability to make a psychic connection with humans (Close Encounters). One of the kids has a seemingly useless obsession that winds up helping to save the day in a climactic sequence (fireworks here and inventions in the Goonies) however the creature is much too smart to fall for such a trick (Jaws - ""he\'s either very smart or very stupid""). An old guy, who is an expert on this creature (Jaws) winds up dying while the army shoots through the town and tanks roll (War of the Worlds).Then the characters put the story together in one long expositional scene and we are not really sure how they figured it all out (Minority Report). It seems the monster is really a misunderstood good guy (Goonies) who makes a connection with our hero (ET, Close Encounters) and then flies home (E.T), but not before a lot of missing people are returned (Close Encounters) and lots of appliances fly around (Poltergeist).The End.', ""Steven Spielberg and J.J Abrams working on a project together. That idea alone is great however the finished project is a masterpiece. I was expecting a lot when I walked into the theater, when I walked out, not only were my expectations met but it was much better than i thought it would be. Let's start off with the actors, they all did a great job, but I was really impressed with Elle Fanning's acting, she added lots to the movie. I know it won't happen for this movie but I think she deserves an Oscar for her performance. Next, let's talk about the overall movie, it was great, it had, action, comedy, Mystery, romance, and suspense. The special effects were amazing, best this year. Now, the ending, i'm not going to say what happens, but many people hated it but I thought it was perfect, great way to end the film. Overall, suspense, action packed movie with great special effects and great acting from underrated stars makes the best movie of 2011, and one of the best movies ever. 10/10"", 'First half hour is great, feels like Stranger Things, then progressively all the clichè for these kind of films starts kickin in (like mad scientist that in the basement of the school hides precious secret tapes where he explained Area 51-like stuff) and in the last 30 minutes what could have been a great movie turns in a sort of sad ""ET. Phone. Home"".The last ten minutes are the worst, and made me take away another star from the rating.A missed opportunity. What a shame, the kids were great, for sure the best part of the movie.', ""Set in the early 80s some kids are making a short film in their small town and witness a train crash then weird stuff starts happening around the town. The first time I watched this movie I was the same age as the kids, I didn't like it with nothing driving forward the plot apart from the film. Now I understand that it's just the filmmakers remaking their childhoods, not for their earlier selves but for the present day versions. It's a mix of the iron giant and Steven Kings group of kids movie, it doesn't advance much further than that. The ending needed to be small focussed around the kids but it decided to end like the Iron Giant rather than It or Stand by me."", 'Growing up, I was in the generation of a lot of great kid\'s films like The Goonies, The Sandlot, Monster Squad and Stand by Me. But sadly my generation seemed to be the last one where we had great kid films that not only insulted it\'s demographic, but also had the great adventure that we needed. Watching those movies were just a great time and they\'ve remained classics ever since I think because we haven\'t had a movie for a couple of decades. Steven Spielberg was the man who brought a lot of these classics alive, who better to collaborate with J.J. Abrams who knows great action and obviously has a love of the movies I just mentioned. They bring us Super 8, the trailers remained so mysterious and made you want to see the movie, because all it was, was a car crashing into a train and you had to guess what just jumped out of it. Sadly I had to wait until the rental, however what a great movie that I feel people are being just a little bit rough on.Joe, a 13-year-old boy living in a small town in Ohio, has lost his mother in a factory accident. His friend Charles Kaznyk convinces schoolmate Alice to be the protagonist\'s wife in his low-budget zombie movie on Super 8 film. Alice steals her father\'s car and takes Joe, Charles, Preston, Martin, and Cary to an old train depot where the group plans to film a scene. During the shoot, Charles sees a train coming towards the depot and sets up the cameras, hoping that the passing train will add authenticity to the scene. As they are filming Joe watches a pick-up truck drive onto the tracks and place itself in the path of an oncoming train, causing a massive explosion. Something breaks open one of the train car\'s doors and escapes. They discover that their teacher caused the ""accident"" and that there is something invading their town. Together they try to find out what it is and help each other when the times get more rough.The weird thing is I really did enjoy this movie, not just because of the nostalgic feeling but I honestly felt this was a good movie. I loved the chemistry between the kids, they all clicked so well and their friendships seemed very real. I loved the special effects, they didn\'t seem over the top with the CGI. The only complaint I would have with the film is the ending, where the kid is talking to the alien and saying how he could relate to him that bad things happen, which I though was very cheesy, but that\'s the Spielberg effect. I don\'t know why there are any negative reviews on the film, I know that you can\'t win them all but I loved that this traveled back in time for the adults and a great new way to introduce an excellent genre to the younger generation. Who knows if we will have any more classics down the line, but this was a fun trip down nostalgic lane. Super 8 has laughs, action, suspense and reminds you why you loved being a kid before technology hit so hard.9/10', 'In the late 70\'s, in the small town Lillian, the boy Joseph ""Joe"" Lamb (Joel Courtney) misses his mother, who died in an accident in the local mills. His father and local deputy Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) wants to send Joe to a summer camp to spend vacation but he wants to stay in Lillian to help his friend Charles Kaznyk (Riley Griffiths) to make a super 8 movie.Joe has a crush on Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) but Jackson hates her father and does not want Joe to be close to Alice. However, Joe\'s friends invite Alice to be the lead actress of their zombie movie and they head to a train station to shoot a scene during the night. Out of the blue, they witness a train crash provoked by their teacher Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman) with his pickup and Joe takes a small object that he finds in the wreckage. Sooner the location is surrounded by the Air Force militaries under the command of Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich) that evacuate the town. When Joe and his friends watch the footage of the accident, they discover what the military are seeking in Lillian.""Super 8"" is a film that combines ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" with ""Predator"". The result is unoriginal but highly entertaining, with all the clichés of the genre. The film made by the Charles is entwined in the credits and is hilarious. The soundtrack with classics from the 70\'s is another plus in this film. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Super 8""', 'J.J. Abrams and the legendary Steven Spielberg join forces in this coming-of-age, science fiction film, Super 8. In the small town of Lilian, Ohio, a group of teenagers are making a zombie movie with their Super 8 mm camera, but fall witness to a catastrophic train crash. What follows are a series of mysterious events that include people missing, local dogs being discovered in neighboring counties, and the appearance of the military. I showed up to the movie\'s midnight premiere with very high expectations. A year ago, seeing the teaser trailer that implied that a mysterious alien creature would run amok just left me anticipating for June 10th to come. I was a huge fan of Cloverfield for its originality and non- stop action (as well as the monster himself), so I expected J.J. to create a masterpiece of its own. The way I can describe this movie is that it\'s like a recipe for a chocolate cake. The cake surely tastes delicious, but looking in the recipe book, you expected a little more. For example, many have complained about the ending, and this I can agree on. It\'s so rushed and abrupt right when you\'re in the middle of the awe and action that it\'s almost a bit of a turnoff. There were also points where the movie seemed so unrealistic (i.e. the Biology teacher surviving the train crash with half of his truck left unharmed), but they\'re things to be overlooked. What Abrams does perform though is an excellent set-up of the plot and production design. Yes, the plot does get messy by becoming various different types of movies, but it does it in a way that just manages to work out in the end. The design of the film was also well done, whether it be the beautiful train collision scene, the 80s feel, or the creature itself.The film itself pays a solid homage to classic Spielberg, giving off a ""Close Encounters With The Third Kind""/""E.T.""-esque vibe. However, this doesn\'t quite live up to either of those films. It turns out the reasons behind the alien\'s attacks is *SPOILERS* the usual ""creature kept in captivity and tortured, and now hates all of mankind"" cliché. It doesn\'t ruin the film, but it leaves a small tarnish on it. What separates this from most other summer flicks though is that it has a heart. The relationship between this young group of friends is flawless, and brings me back to when I was just a kid. Like most have said, it\'s like ""The Goonies"" or ""The Sandlot"" all over again. Acting-wise, the young and unknown (minus one face) cast is absolutely top-notch. Elle Fanning has proved herself to grow up into a strong and emotional actress, possibly better than her older sibling Dakota. Joel Courtney does an especially phenomenal job as Joe Lamb, who just can\'t let go of the recent death of his mother, and proves himself an especially powerful character in a scene where him and his Dad have a tear-jerking argument. Kyle Chandler does a great job as Joe\'s overburdened father, who not only has to juggle with the death of his wife, but the mysteries and troubles occurring in this town. Ron Eldard as Elle\'s character\'s father is truly an underrated and troubled character. Overall, outstanding cast.Overall, Super 8 is truly a unique summer flick in its own, but it just misses at certain points that make you feel like you expected some more from it.', 'Although I could create an extensive list of cliché one-liners, obvious inconsistencies, and totally unrealistic occurrences (even for a PG-13 sc-fi movie), the underlying reason that I will influence friends to not see this movie is because the plot was weak and shallow.First of all, there are actually 4 subplots that a viewer has to juggle between!1) A budding romantic relationship between the two main (middle school) characters 2) Mending a tense father-child relationship(s) (also with both main characters) 3) A group of early teens helping the alien return home and... 4) A son finding a way to cope with the loss of his mother *I might not have deemed 4) as a plot line if it wasn\'t for the intentionally-dramatic ""letting the alien take mom\'s locket"" scene as the last scene in the movie*These plots were all given fairly even amounts of attention and while they did have some connecting, because there is not much screen-time or time dedicated to deepen dialogue within the individual plots, they all come off as unimportant.While it does have a fair amount of suspense, the action sequences are typical at best.Overall, just a flat-out poor showing by high profile names (and a $45m budget).Like I mentioned in the beginning sentence, there are so many things that just don\'t make any sense. But the biggest question I had walking away is why did the Air Force end up killing Dr. Woodward??? There was no reason for his murder whatsoever! (Not considering the fact that he was still alive after a head-on collision with a speeding freight train). It\'s almost funny how drastic that decision was by the ""evil Air Force Sargent,"" Nelec.', ""It is nostalgia ridden like many other films have been this past decade, the only difference is it's not of the cynical kind.The film's narrative FELT all over the place (probably more the plot than the narrative) - there was a certain tightness missing from this that was present in J.J. Abrams' previous film but, other than that, everything else did exactly what it's supposed to. The kids are both engaging and entertaining, the monster turns out to be quite frightening, the dialogue's great, the acting's great, visual effects, cinematography- everything's on point.It felt like I was watching a proper film! I mean it seems too much to ask for from our blockbusters these days.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Jordan, Isaach De Bankolé, Danny Sapani, Dorothy Steel, Zainab Jah;The people of Wakanda fight to protect their home from intervening world powers as they mourn the death of King T'Challa.;"[""I am conflicted with this film and with Marvel.Let's review the good first. There is a heartfelt tribute to T'Challa and obviously to the actor who played him. The emotions shown feel real and manage to move. The performances are good in this regard. Angela Bassett stands out above the rest.I'm not one to oppose the replacement of Atlantis by Talokan, as this gives another excellent excuse to show some content that derives from universal culture in gigantic products like the MCU movies. Namor is an excellent addition to the ranks of Marvel superheroes immediately showing how powerful he is and what he is capable of.The action sequences are entertaining, as Marvel has already accustomed us.The wardrobe is also something to value in this film. There is a great effort and meaning behind each of the suits, which successfully try to mix the different cultures with the new times full of technology. This makes an excellent contribution to character design.Now what I didn't like about the movie. The entire story feels too light and if you think about it, pretty ridiculous. Namor's motivations don't match his plans or his actions throughout the film. Marvel Studios again falls flat when writing and developing their villains. It all feels like a mere excuse for the characters to clash. There is nothing really of weight in the story, except for the death of T'Challa, which is also not well used, abusing the drama whenever they can.I liked Riri Williams' introduction, but not Ironheart's introduction. The story devoured her as a secondary character and was relegated to the background when in fact the beginning of the film gives her much more importance.The pacing of the movie is inconsistent. It's pretty monotonous until the action scenes, which are good, but short. Sometimes, there is too much information happening too fast without giving the opportunity to fully appreciate each sequence and each character involved.Finally, the effects are good, as expected, but something is wrong with the composition of the cities. Both Wakanda and Talokan have a contrast and color problem that prevents them from being fully appreciated.The final battle scenario also seems pretty bad to me.Overall, the movie is entertaining if you just want to have fun with fights and visuals, but I think it's about time Marvel got serious about their movies and realized that adults are also consuming superhero movies."", 'Let\'s start with the good points - this film doesn\'t try to be all comedy and spectacle, like the recent Dr Strange 2 and Thor 4. In fact, there is almost zero comedy at all.It does try to bring some drama, and to make some points about the responsibility of nations to use their wealth, resources and technology for global benefit, rather than national advancement.Namor is different to the comics, but once I got past the initial differences, I think the portrayal was a good one. He isn\'t a one-dimensional villain, his people are descended from the Mayans, and he has proper motivation.But the film has a lot of problems. Firstly, the pacing is all over the place - it should be at least half an hour shorter. The comic-book science is paper thin (Shuri extracts DNA from plant fibres on a bracelet that has been underwater for 400 years, but cannot do the same from the recently dead plant in her lab). Shuri takes a spear right through her stomach and out of her back, but gets over it after a short breather. The Wakandan ship is breached from undersea, tilts over by 45 degrees and then the next scene it is upright and apparently seaworthy again. The fact that Namor\'s people take mortal wounds but get up again is never explained.And then there is still my biggest problem with Wakanda. Both Black Panther films promote the idea that Wakanda is a Utopian society, both technology and socially. Yet they still choose their leader by who is best at beating up other challengers.I think there was a missed opportunity here. Namor would be more likely to say ""join us, or if not, don\'t get in our way"", as he plans to attack the rest of the surface world. This would present Wakanda with a far more interesting moral dilemma - standby by and watch untold millions die, or utilise their resources and technology to aid the nations who have been trying to rob them.', ""I never thought the original Black Panther was anywhere near being the best solo Marvel movie, but I did enjoy it and T'Challa's character throughout his appearances. With that being said, when Chadwick Boseman sadly passed, I accepted that this franchise was doomed. I always believed that recasting T'Challa was the only way to go. It would've been incredibly hard to find a good replacement, but the character is very important to the Marvel universe. It is also simply too soon to pass the mantle of Black Panther on. When they confirmed he wouldn't be recast, I felt like it was a big mistake narratively.Now does Wakanda Forever handle the death of T'Challa/Boseman well? Absolutely! Being able to respect the legacy of the actor while also metatextually connecting the event to an in-universe tragedy is definitely one of the movie's standout features. Regardless, I feel like the movie is a little too reliant on the audience being impacted by Boseman's passing.Don't get me wrong, the fully silent opening gave me chills. They incorporated the death beautifully and honorably, but the result is what feels like two movies in one. You can clearly tell the original script was written before Chadwick's death. I really respect Coogler's decision to not recast, but I still wish T'Challa and Namor got to cross paths.My issues spring not from the T'Challa-related parts of the film, but from how the rest feels lacking without his presence. I don't think Shuri works as the protagonist. She was a fun (yet underdeveloped) carefree tech nerd in the original movie and here she takes a 180 to being reserved and bitter. The changes to her character were perhaps necessary for this story, but it doesn't make them good changes for her. Some don't match her at all and her vengeful arc is just T'Challa's from Civil War with a less fitting character. She never struck me as someone who would willingly become the Black Panther and there isn't much impact when she does anyway.Ramonda is a pleasant surprise in this movie. Her monologues are insane. Angela Bassett deserves all the credit she's been receiving. However, Okoye is the only character I felt really connected to and she is stupidly sidelined a third into the movie. She would've enhanced the film a lot if given more screen time. So would've M'Baku, who is completely wasted. Between them and W'Kabi, who is fully absent, we have three characters connected to T'Challa and it isn't explored how his death affected any of them personally. This is one of many missed opportunities that came with trying to focus the movie on both Talokan and T'Challa's death.Some of the action scenes are awesome and some drag. As to be expected from Danai Gurira, Okoye's fight scenes are the tensest we've gotten from Marvel all year.Namor himself is a pretty good villain. In a similar fashion to Killmonger, his actor sells the character for me despite his viewpoints being completely ridiculous. They somehow managed to adapt his crazy mutant powers to live-action in a cool way. Changing his kingdom from Atlantis to Talokan ended up being a really cool idea, even though the place and its people needed more elaboration. There are many more cool concepts they could've explored with the Aztec roots. Hopefully they are saving more about the civilization, the people's powers, and their technology for a Namor project.Ironheart is an even more underdeveloped part of the movie, undoubtedly to save content for her upcoming show. Her character is just as dumb and not relatable as I expected her to be and her suit looks awful. A Black Panther movie didn't feel like the right place to introduce an Iron Man ripoff.Also, Ross's entire storyline felt weird and unneeded. It's only included to add awkward colonizer jokes and set up future MCU films. If he and Ironheart were removed, there would definitely be enough room to have included more from the aforementioned underutilized characters.By the latter half of this movie, the pacing really starts to drag. I've complained recently about Marvel movies like Multiverse of Madness and Love and Thunder being way too short, but this film had no reason to be 2 hours and 40 minutes and feel like it's over 3 hours. There's so much downtime between the action that when the final battle starts, the movie has already overstayed its welcome.The things I'm disappointed they didn't include or flesh out have no excuse to not be here or be better implemented considering how aggressively long and slow the film is.So this definitely isn't a bad movie per se, but it's not fantastic either. It's very bold but very flawed with iffy decisions on what to prioritize and how to structure this challenging project. I was pretty disappointed when I first saw it, but there's some great stuff sprinkled throughout. The lack of T'Challa, awkward pacing, and wasted opportunities easily made it worse than the first movie to me."", ""If there is one thing BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER gets right is the reverence and respect it gives to the memory of Chadwick Boseman, taken from us way too soon after making the role of T'Challa, the Black Panther, totally and uniquely his own. From the opening montage, where he is the only Marvel superhero whose visage we see, onward throughout the film, his shadow looms over the characters, story, and action. We feel his missing presence in every scene. It is clear that director Ryan Coogler, the returning members of the cast from the first film, and the producers where dealt a very difficult hand when crafting a sequel and finding a way forward. Perhaps it was an impossible chore, perhaps there was no way they could have succeeded under these conditions, but the resulting film was just a disappointment as far as I'm concerned. In the absence Boseman, WAKANDA FOREVER fills the void by elevating the principle female characters to center stage, and having them face off against a threat from Prince Namor, the leader of an undersea race heretofore unknown to the MCU over the issue of vibranium, an all purpose element found in abundance in Wakanda (and the source of its technological superiority), and now for the first time, discovered outside the African nation on the ocean's floor. Coveted by other nations, this sets off a conflict when Namor demands that Wakanda do his dirty work for him, and eliminate the threat from the surface world. I don't fault the actresses-Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and the indomitable Angela Bassett-who totally give it their all, and clearly bring it. But the script goes heavy on the themes of female empowerment, anti-colonialism, and Afro-futurism that earn praise from mainstream film critics and pop culture commentators at the expense of the tension and conflict, and even humor that made the first film something special. A cameo by Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger in a dream sequence only served as a further reminder of what WAKANDA FOREVER was missing. At a running time of more than two and half hours, WAKANDA FOREVER works way too hard to generate some heat with its thin plot. Namor is played by Tenoch Huerta as another antagonist motivated by past injustice, so he never really feels like a Big Bad. And those wings on his heels look silly. Tweaking Namor's origin to make him and his undersea kingdom have a connection to the ancient Mayans, who escape Spanish oppression by ingesting vibranium, works, but giving all of them but Namor blue skin invokes unflattering comparisons to AVATAR (it didn't help that the trailer for James Cameron's latest epic played in the theater before WAKANDA FOREVER). There are some great action set pieces, something the MCU does well, but the resolution of the final battle between Princess Shuri and Namor is underwhelming. There are a few cameos, and I liked the interplay between Martin Freeman and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss. And was I the only one who thought Richard Schiff was just playing an older version of his character from THE WEST WING when he shows up as the Secretary of State?There is a single mid-credits scene that reveals that the legacy of T'Challa is more than what it first appeared, something I thought the movie was leading toward all along. It opens up a host of possibilities for future BLACK PANTHER films, but I was further disappointed that there is no hint as to where Phase IV of the MCU is heading. That was one of my complaints with THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER and I think the loyal fans are getting restless. Namor is a character with a lot of history with The Fantastic Four, and this would have been an opportunity to give us some idea of how and when they might be introduced into the main MCU. Namor also mentions that he is a mutant, one of the first ones ever in the Marvel universe, raising the possibility of the X-Men showing up-how great would it have been if he'd been approached by Magneto in another after credits scene seeing how their back stories have similarities. Will just have to wait and see what the next Ant-Man movie shows us."", 'First of all, RIP to Chadwick Boseman. They really did do a good tribute to him in this movie through various devices. Performances when reflecting his death felt real and convincing, probably because there was little ""acting"" involved. Losing a franchise star is really a tough blow. While I felt Boseman\'s absence, I don\'t think not all of the movie\'s downfalls are linked to his absence.Biggest head-scratching moments were for me was poor writing mainly from some of the tactical choices. The whole conflict stems from the existence of Riri (soon to be Ironheart), who built a Vibranium detector for a school project. Apparently, she\'s the only one in the world who can do that. Aside from that ridiculous premise, I thought Ironheart\'s introduction to the MCU was not bad (I still think the suit is ugly). She was likable enough and I think she has potential. I do worry about the overlap between her and Shuri because while they do have good chemistry, they are such similar characters. Anyways, this detector triggers a cascade of events where Shuri and Riri are taken to Talokan. First of all, getting rid of Riri will not do anything because the technology is no longer in her hands alone. Also, Wakandans have very little reason to protect her other than the fact she\'s a great scientist. I was also baffled that key hostages like Shuri and Riri could escape Taloka with the help of one person DURING an ongoing negotiation. A rookie foreign affairs mistake. It was not even a hostage situation. It was closer to an aggressive invitation. This was literally the cause of the all-out war and I thought it was just poorly written how they started that conflict. And at that point, the entire war felt so meaningless and stakeless because it wasn\'t clear why they were fighting. It still isn\'t clear why Talokans wanted to go to war with Wakanda. So whatever came after that became difficult to love. Ramonda\'s death was also quite preventable in my opinion. The queen with no protection and left to drown. Like why does Riri matter so much to Ramonda that she sacrificed herself to save her? It almost felt like an artificial plot device to pump up Ironheart\'s value as a a character. And Shuri does not blame Riri once or show any animosity toward her even though she was an indirect cause of her mother\'s death? Seemed a little strange unless she didn\'t know what happened.There were positive things too. I thought Taloka\'s story was interesting and was well introduced. Loved Namor as a character and his action scenes were powerful enough. The performances were solid across the board, especially Ramonda and Namor shined. I thought some of the battle sequences were interesting despite being imperfect (really bad CG moments here and there). Overall, it was rather inconsistent with really cool spear fighting scenes and just generic scenes. The whales really did surprise me. I thought the locations were well chosen. I really like their portrayal of Wakanda and Taloka in general so that\'s a plus. I enjoyed how they incorporated the idea of the oppressed (the Mayans) versus oppressor like they did in Black Panther 1. But again, this should only unite Taloka and Wakanda together rather than fight against each other.I\'d also like to comment on Shuri. She has now become the official franchise star with the death of Ramonda and T\'challa. My overall impression that while she has the potential to be the franchise but it\'s a tough transition. She\'s been known as the geek scientist sister but now she\'s the black panther and the sole protector of Wakanda. That\'s a big jump for both the audience and the character. That type of transition, fueled mostly by grief and revenge, should usually take multiple movies or a series to hash out but that was not an option for the production team. So while I still am not used to the transition, I think they were handled as well as they could be. Her characterization was complex and meaningful enough. A far better experience than the most recent MCU movie.In the end, phase 4 has been a let-down for most fans with a notable exception. I was disappointed that this movie was not able to be part of that exception.', ""This movie had so many slow parts. I kept falling asleep. This is very unusual for me. Unfortunately, it just could not keep my attention. It was nowhere near as good as the first Black Panther movie. I appreciate that they were trying to be respectful toward Chadwick Boseman, but I think they overdid it. Also, Martin Freeman's role in this movie was... odd. It felt shoehorned in as a touchstone to the previous Black Panther movie. Finally, I'm not sure how they are going to redeem Namor. He came off as a true villain and wasn't redeemed at all. Is the plan to have him continue to be a villain going forward?"", ""Wakanda Forever tells the story of how Wakanda got a new Black Panther in a war with the Atlantis (or whoever they were). The film's best parts are the underwater beings who attack Wakanda. Prince Namor is really cool and the actor who plays him has great screen presence. His underwater people are a lot of fun to see in action.The film's big problem is that the lead is insufferable and annoying. She doesn't have a lot of screen charisma, makes a much better sidekick than a main protagonist, and overall it's not that interesting that she ever becomes Black Panther. You never really root for her I this film.Also, this film is mostly boring acting and writing repeating information we already know and everyone being depressed all the time. It's hard to get into a movie that is two hours and forty minutes of this.Probably, it should have just been called Namor and have Wakanda be the side characters."", ""I didn't think it was possible to make a black panther 2 after our beloved hero passed away. But this has exceeded my expectations.For me It got 8 stars for the following:The intro of the film made us fear the new water tribe.Namor's presence and outstanding performance. Also the way he was flying was brilliant.Shuri's character growth was sad but overwhelming. It's not easy for a girl to lose her care and security providers (mother and brother) therefore she will expierence grief and anger then the urge to become responsible will become a life or death matter. The actress did well.Namor and Shuri's fight was brilliant this scene alone is worth 5 stars, I mean it's a marvel movie combat is supposed to be the main focus, right?Namor was alot stronger but Shuri still won because of her brain, such weakening Namor by draning and burnning him, it made sense because she is the creative genuis and she isn't supposed to win it as a power house like her brother.2 minus was for:\nNakia saving Shuri didn't make sense, it was whole kingdom and Nakia just popped up in the exact jail chamber? She was supposed to face death sharks and fight ships before that.I wasn't a fan of the young scientist, her scenes were the most boring ones, it's not the actress she is good but her character didn't add meaning I understand that she was supposed to be the trigger for Namor's tyranny but they could have found million other triggers or a more interesting character to add? Such as the woman who was attempting to runaway with the helicopter since she shot his men idk."", ""At this point, Marvel is getting too saturated for its own good. The movie's beginning and the end is good, but the middle is too slow and crammed with corporate-mandated plot requirements, so much so that the writers didn't know what to do.I really feel that this is the product of unrealistic corporate deadlines, leading to incohesive and plot-hole ridden story, subpar CGI, and morally problematic characters that we are supposed to think are heroes. I don't think Marvel is really taking the time to quality check.To start, the villain is not really likeable or unlikeable. The villain just sort of exists. At least the first Black Panther movie had a villain that was likeable, carried by the performance of Michael B. Jordan. Another point of weakness is how Ironheart was crammed into the plot as required by Disney. As they tried to cram her in, plot points began to crack (which will not be mentioned here due to spoilers). The story is not cohesive. The third, and perhaps the biggest, point of weakness is the action scenes.Action scenes, you would think, would be the centerpieces of superhero movies, right? But Marvel's sweat-shop CGI studios seem to lack the motivation or at least the time to render quality products, not to mention how the choreography is sub-par as well. At the end, Black Panther 2's action scenes are forgettable.It is mildly entertaining enough to be an airplane or a steam-at-home movie, but this is by no means a great movie."", ""I enjoyed the Black Panther even though it was not all that great in the first place. This sequel was a hot mess. Wakanda is no longer even a semblance of a secret African country, just a location where black people are playing dress up in a movie. A lot of the storylines just fell flat. Some characters just appeared for 2 minutes and never heard of again.At times there was so much dialogue which did nothing to further the plot, where was the editing team? There are very few actors who can captivate the audience with their words none of those actors happened to be in this movie.The CGI was good and the action was pretty good. Its a Marvel superhero movie so I didn't expect much more than this. Black Panther was always a favorite comic book hero of mine and I am saddened that they could not do better for that legacy."", ""Disney/Marvel please give us more of this! It was a return to form and better! The characters were real and grounded. There was actual emotion from the actors/actresses/characters and throughout the movie as a whole. A laugh here or there, PERFECTLY BALANCED (as all things should be). As someone who recently lost a loved one, the movie hit me in the feels hard, something I've come to not expect from a Disney/Marvel production. I mean seriously loved this movie. I also find it admirable how respectful the production was towards Mr. Boseman. I'm also glad they did not over play Ironman through Riri Williams. Of course there's always something to nitpick but they were completely overshadowed in my opinion. Someone please give Ms. Bassett a damn crown, she was a jewel in this film! I will 100% see this again!"", 'I was let down with this one. Action was sub par. Tried to hard to be ""emotionally relevant"". I understand the tribute to Chadwick, but this whole movie was kind of a downer. Way too goodie two shoes. This was almost... almost, as bad as Wonder Woman 2. I don\'t understand why they had to drag this out for almost three hours. The underwater city was completely non visible because it was so dark. It was also like they were a primitive people. Playing with rocks? No machines? And really can\'t live out of water. One well placed nuke and the whole civilization is gone. Obviously not a lot of thought went into this one but at least we got some more female lead characters out of it.', ""Depsite there being a few interesting aspects to this film, like a number of elements that seemed to have been borrowed from Ancient Greek mythology (namely the sirens and the winged feet), I have to admit that I found that this film was rather dull and boring. I guess one of the reasons was that Boseman's death seemed to be hanging over the entire film. Sure, one should pay tribute to him, but the problem is that I felt that it went just a little bit too far at times, and thus it really wasn't all that enjoyable.The film is basically about how the rest of the world have become rather annoyed at Wakunda because they aren't willing to share Vibranium with them, but they then discover some at the bottom of the ocean, using a machine that has been designed to detect vibranium. However, the rig is attacked and everybody on the rig is killed, and of course the people who are first accused is Wakunda. It turns out that they aren't the only ones who have access to vibranium, as the leader of a nation of undersea peoples approaches them and instructs them to find the scientist who invented the detector.Okay, ignoring the fact that a country who's economy is based on a single resource (and a resource that they don't even trade) is unlikely to become a world superpower (and of course they clearly don't want to interact with the rest of the world either), it does put things into perspective, particularly with regards to the United States. Unlike the previous film, there is more going on in the United States, and there is clearly some animosity towards Wakanda, namely because they aren't willing to play fair, at least play fair as far as the developed world is concerned.However, the main focus of the film seems to involve two empires who have vibranium coming into contact with each other, and the question iswho would win in the battle. This, mind you, results in there being a number of other plots that seem to not get resolved, or get resolved a bit too quickly, particularly the one involving the CIA agent who is eventually arrested because, well, he has got a bit too close to the Wakundans. Of course, we also have the ending, which is interesting, namely due to the suggestion that Wakunda may not actually be able to effectively integrate into the world at large.Still, in the end, I really found that this film was quite lacking, and rather boring. Some have suggested that Marvel can't do sequels, but I don't think that is the case because they have released some pretty good sequels. However, as for this one, I can't really place my finger on it, but it really didn't grab me all that much, and in part I really couldn't wait for it to end.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

America-centrism (the government blame the French for everything), professional sports, pro wrestling (the drivers are badly acted ""theme"" types), Big Brother, and just about everything else you could name.  At the same time it panders to the blood lust of the audience with cartoon violence.  Sylvester Stallone is hilarious as a driver with the mannerisms of a 30\'s gangster, practicing on his accent for the Rocky movies.  A must -see.', 'WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERSDeath Race 2000 opens with a cartoon title sequence that looks like a child\'s crayon drawing on polystyrene. It\'s backed up with a theme tune that sounds as if the tape\'s chewed, and cuts to a poorly superimposed ""futuristic"" setting.The rest of the film is like this. Cheap, somewhat curiously directed, poorly acted and shouldn\'t work. Yet somehow it does. Is this the most subversive American movie ever made? There\'s occasional digs at other races (The Nazi driver ""Herman the German"" for one), but in the main it\'s U.S. culture that is being constantly lambasted. A future America where the Stars and Stripes are red and gold, and the President (Sandy McCallum) says things like ""I have made the United Provinces of America the greatest power in the known universe."" Even when slating other races, the finger points back to gung-ho xenophobia, as when the President hilariously states ""It is no coincidence, my dear children, that the word \'sabotage\' was invented by the French.""Not only is this open season on it\'s country of origin\'s own culture, it also has some of the sickest humour ever seen in a mainstream movie. The central concept is of a car race where killing pedestrians gains the drivers points in the contest. ""And toddlers, under twelve, now rate a big 70 points"", explains a TV announcer. There\'s also a specially arranged ""Euthanasia Day"" at the local geriatrics\' hospital, and the supreme sickness of the title quote.What adds to the film is its sense of unmitigated cheese. David Carradine is lame in the lead role, while many of the other \x96 equally lacklustre \x96 performers struggle with a third-rate script. Sample line? ""You know Myra, some people might think you\'re cute. But me I think you\'re just one large baked potato."" This combines with ""pit stop"" scenes which involve little else other than gratuitous nudity. Violence in the movie is shot and edited as if it thinks it matches the gore of Cronenberg or Tom Savini. However, it\'s merely tame and almost comical as badly staged red paint explodes everywhere. Some of the car racing is also sped up, which resembles less fast cars, more Keystone Kops. However, as much of this is overlaid with incongruous classical music there\'s every possibility that this is intentional. It\'s also fun seeing Sylvester Stallone beaten senseless by a skinny Carradine in a poorly choreographed fight. Imagine Mad Max involved in a fight between Wacky Races and Benny Hill and you\'re part way there to imagining what this unique film is like.Stallone is ""Machine Gun Joe"", described as being ""loved by thousands, hated by millions"", which is quite apt. While I\'m a Stallone fan (apologist?) it\'s worth noting that this is less a Stallone acting appearance (Rocky, Copland...), more a Stallone by-the-numbers performance (Rocky IV, Judge Dredd...)Of course, while all this is thrown together at such a force and with such a delightfully hammy velocity that it makes it great amusement, there is evidence that it\'s one-joke satire isn\'t enough to fill it\'s paltry 78 minutes running time. Like the cars that are supposedly driving fast but are really puttering along at a snail\'s pace, the final quarter of the movie runs the risk of grinding to a halt. A final satirical barb by a racing commentator (""The race is the symbol of everything we hold dear, our American way of life. Sure it\'s violent, but that\'s the way we love it... violent, violent, violent!"") seems to overstate the matter and falls flat.The ending is resolved with yet more poorly animated titles and a narration that talks about man\'s need for violence. One of the best bad movies I\'ve ever seen, Death Race 2000 is within reach of absolute greatness, though doesn\'t - quite - manage it. 6/10.', ""Wonderful B movie shot in the style and acting of cheap porn of that era. Then again some of this cast have history there. That said, this has some great humour and does play the 1984 political thread well. As for storyline think of this combined with Escape From New York another golden oldie. What's new in 2018, Death Race, Beyond Anarchy ???. They're so out of ideas they're digging up stories almost half a century old or copying comics.

Lots of transformer screen time surprisingly, a definite upgrade from the 4th movie. No more pixelated transformations like the 4th movie.

Honestly, I felt as though I'd been sat in the cinema for years, never mind the already far too long two-and-a-half hours I actually had to endure this for. Not a single frame provided even a morsel of entertainment - which is weird because, for all intents and purposes, the admittedly impressive visual effects should've at least granted me some brief form of passive enjoyment during one of the over-blown action set-pieces. Yet, the takeaway I have from the picture is this: only Michael Bay (and his team, of course) could make something as inherently exciting as giant robots battling one another so painfully and utterly dull. 3/10."", ""So far, the Transformers movie series has come to the fifth. The Last Knight isn't very convinced to the critics, they complained the story,too many bombs and I have to admit that the plot does exist some loopholes.

The actors'performance is great, especially Anthony Hopkins.He helps to push the development of the story and his performance was tremendous good. I love the interaction between Cade and Vivian.The robot butler(sorry i cant remember his name) also created many funny and hilarious scenes for the audience. Everyone was enjoyed the film when I watched in the cinema last night. The fight scenes in the movie are very great and epic. Especially how Bumblebee clashed on Optimus Prime and Bumblebee's debut was also very amazing。 I believe people come to watch Transformers movie all because they just want to see how the autobots and decepticons fight to each other.To fulfill audience's expectation, you have to put more bombings , buildings collapse in the movie and obviously Michael Bay is the perfect choice for this kind of ordinary commercial popcorn movie. It never runs out of steam, and the blasts in the movie really light up your tense."", ""We've got to the point where no one expects anything good from any of these Transformer movies, and this one is no different.

Sherlock Holmes;2009;Action, Adventure, Mystery;7.6;PG-13;57;Guy Ritchie;Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong, Eddie Marsan, Robert Maillet, Geraldine James, Kelly Reilly, William Houston, Hans Matheson, James Fox, William Hope, Clive Russell, Oran Gurel, David Garrick, Ky Discala, Andrew Brooke, Tom Watt;Detective Sherlock Holmes and his stalwart partner Watson engage in a battle of wits and brawn with a nemesis whose plot is a threat to all of England.;"['Nearly hundreds of actors have played Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick Dr. Watson, and it may seem rash to call Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law the best Holmes-and-Watson-duo so far. But I\'ve been a Sherlock Holmes fan my whole life, and most of the portrayals I\'ve seen of the character only focus on an aspect or two of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s character. In Guy Ritchie\'s film, as in Doyle\'s ""canon"", Sherlock Holmes is an avid boxer, a martial artist, a dabbler in many sciences, and a master of disguise. Most importantly, he\'s an expert in logic and deduction. He playfully torments his housekeeper Ms. Hudson (Geraldine James) and shares an antagonistic but symbiotic relationship with police Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan).The movie opens with Holmes and Watson apprehending serial killing Satanist Lord Blackwood (played broodingly by Mark Strong). Blackwood is executed, but when he seemingly rises from the dead, the deductive duo must determine whether it\'s a supernatural occurrence or if there\'s a logical explanation. It\'s exactly the type of mystery Doyle would have devised, with plenty of twists and opportunities for Holmes to show off his genius as he races to stop a plot to take over England and (gasp!) America. Everything from the experiments Holmes performs in his Baker Street flat to his climatic revelation of the mystery on the Tower Bridge seems perfectly in line with Doyle\'s writing.One of the only departures from the canon that bothered me was Sherlock\'s introduction to Dr. Watson\'s fiancée, Mary Morstan, played as a delicate English rose by Kelly Reilly. In the stories, Mary was Holmes\' client in ""The Sign of Four"" before Holmes first encountered Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) in ""A Scandal in Bohemia."" Then again, the continuity of the stories was rarely important to filmmakers, or even to Sir Arthur, so I\'m just nitpicking.As a film on its own merits, ""Sherlock Holmes"" is almost perfect. The movie\'s opening shot grabs you, and Guy Ritchie\'s directing stays gripping all the way through the end titles. His version of Victorian London is moody and atmospheric. Hans Zimmer\'s quirky score blends well with the film\'s tone and Downey Jr.\'s off-kilter Holmes. Meanwhile, Jude Law transforms Dr. Watson from the bumbling comic relief of most movies into a cool, competent sidekick. Perhaps owing to his own considerable acting chops, he\'s the rare Watson who manages to be as interesting and watchable as Holmes. When he leaps into action, he relies on a sword-cane and a trusty revolver, while Sherlock favors a riding crop (which die-hard fans will recall was his preferred method of self-defense in the canon). Rachel McAdams manages to tweak Sherlock\'s classic adversary into a feisty action heroine. All the while, another familiar adversary skulks in the shadows.Even when Sherlock Holmes feels a little bit more like James Bond, he doesn\'t feel any less like Sherlock Holmes. Ritchie finds a way to depict Sherlock\'s fighting as a mental exercise as much as it\'s a physical feat. In the same way, though ""Sherlock Holmes"" is grander and more commercial than Guy Ritchie\'s usual films, it doesn\'t feel any less like Guy Ritchie.', ""Sherlock Holmes - Based on the books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the popular detective is portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. His loyal companion Watson (played superbly by Jude Law) is getting married and Holmes is none too happy. Their antics are put on the shelf because Lord Blackwood (ice cold Mark Strong), a powerful man of the occult world, has committed a series of murders. When he is hung, he rises from the grave and promises to drastically change the world with himself as master. With the future of several countries at stake, it is up to Holmes to stop Blackwood. Downey Jr. disappears into the role like the character does with various disguises. He is completely believable as a detective whose deductive skills are so powerful that, without focus, mundane situations are overwhelming to his psyche. The film and role are his.Holmes is portrayed as a borderline manic depressive eccentric who cannot function unless he has a goal to accomplish. In other words: Robert Downey Jr. The film has fun exploring the part of Holmes left untouched by the films done by varying Television productions for many years. Namely: the physical side of Holmes. Yes, Holmes is a boxer, stick/sword fighter, and a martial artist. It was in the books, and it is done in this film as well. He flung Moriarty down a chasm with jujitsu in one of the stories for God's sake! It always bothered me that Holmes's eccentricities and drug-use seemed to be shelved on the screen in favor of a more well-put together stern man who would never deign to get his hands dirty. Holmes was never meant to be a symbol of stiff-upper lip Britain, yet that's what he became. The obvious reasons behind these choices were probably finances (or lack thereof concerning fight co-ordination) and censorship. It's funny how interpretations work. Icons are taken down such a strange path that, when someone decides to bring them to where they started, the old looks new. Batman was always noir. Bond was a quipless suave killer. Holmes could fight. A down and dirty Holmes is more interesting (surprise!) to a 21st century audience than an omniscient uppercrust man eternally in a bathrobe. This Holmes is fairly true to the original character. It may not be true to the Holmes some people have in their heads, but that version cherry picks elements of Doyle's original creation. Actually this Watson is not as close to the original version (younger with no limp), but this Watson ties Holmes to reality, is less of an audience fill-in (read: a dumb shmoe) and kicks some major ass.The film is riveting with only a few parts that actually lag. Huge explanations are saved until the end. We realize we have seem more or less all that Holmes has seen, and yet he gleaned far far more with his powerful intellect. Guy Ritchie's directing is vast and yet detail oriented. It's fairly comprehensible yet there is enough in the dialogue and character relationships to warrant future viewings.Sherlock Holmes is smart and entertaining, a combination which always works better than either adjective by itself. This is an invigorating re-boot that reminds us why the detective is such an icon. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law have perfect chemistry like an old married couple. Mark Strong plays a chilling villain and one lament is that, as part of the film is spent trying to find him, his performance is surprisingly brief. Rachel McAdams is the one part of casting that feels disingenuous. She's not quite devilish or sensuous enough to be the one woman that outsmarted Sherlock Holmes. Still, a thoroughly entertaining film for the head and heart. I look forward to the inevitable sequel. A-"", 'I am so very tired of people reviewing movies, which are subjective by nature, as blanketly ""best ever"" this and ""best ever"" that. That\'s simply a case of small minds and big egos at work. There are so many great Holmes films and portrayals out there, that it\'s asinine to declare any one film or one actor as ""the best"". Most reviewers who rave about this film claim how it finally got ""it"" right. Got what right? Your personal interpretation of Sherlock Holmes in your mind? What about Jack\'s mind? What about Sally\'s? Some go so far as to claim this film merits something extra because it debunks the very debatable myth that Holmes never wore the famous deerstalker cap. For the record, Holmes was described as wearing a hat made of ""cloth"" that was an ""ear-flapped traveling cap"" in the story Silver Blaze. Original illustrator Sidney Paget saw that as meaning a deerstalker in his mind and an image even more famous than the writing on the page was born. Sounds like Paget made a pretty sound deduction too if you ask me. Regardless, if you personally don\'t think Holmes ever wore a deerstalker in the stories would facts like that alone or in combo boost a film so much as to make its interpretation ""the best"". Equally valid claims can be made that Basil Rathbone, Jeremy Brett, Arthur Wontner, Douglas Wilmer, Peter Cushing, Clive Merrison, and others depending on your taste are the best. The question is, was the movie any good on its own and were the performances fun. I don\'t give a hoot if it was exactly how you pictured Holmes in your mind or if you thought it was better/worse than other Holmes\' films or that it somehow isn\'t as authentic because it wasn\'t a verbatim dramatization of a Conan Doyle tale, etc (Jeremy Brett fans, you know what I\'m talking about). If you liked the movie, great. If you like other Holmes\' a lot better, more power to you. I personally think the new Sherlock Holmes film took a lot of hinted at bits of Holmes\' personality and skills from the canon and gave those characteristics the spotlight. That\'s fine. Those aren\'t the qualities that took reign when I read the stories, but who cares? Why would I want to see the exact same thing I saw when I read the books? That would make for a monotonous world. Hurray for everybody\'s various interpretations and subjective and wonderfully different tastes! There are no gospel truths about movies or books or art, so please just say you ""liked it a lot"" instead of it was ""the best"". That\'s so unhelpful. Just tell me what you liked about it as a film on its own without comparing it to any books, or other versions/interpretations. That\'s like saying one food item is ""the best"". It\'s ridiculous. On a final note, this new interpretation is a welcome addition to the world of Sherlock Holmes. It doesn\'t diminish any of the older films or television series. It stands on its own as another fun ride for fans of mystery, action, and those who love many things Sherlock.', 'Many people complains about the plot being confusing, but I found it very simple: Two ninjas, Sherlock and Watson (the former said to be very clever) have a fight each five minutes of the film. In-between fights they try to solve a very difficult case about a bad guy (Lord Blackwood) that, as Count Dracula, has the power to get into the minds of the people and make them cause riots and protests everywhere in Victorian London. Although the bad guy’s ambitions are merely political, he also murders women as a hobby and that’s why he is captured by the two ninjas, then prosecuted and finally hanged.Many people go to see the execution, but nobody (not even the clever ninja) notes that the rope from which the bad guy hangs stays loose around his neck. The other ninja, said to be a physician, takes the pulse of the corpse directly on the neck, and realizes that the rope didn’t leave any mark whatsoever in the dead guy’s neck. Admired by how soft these new ropes are, he says nothing and declares him dead.The bad guy wasn’t dead, but he was buried the same under big blocks of granite. This was a very hard task because these blocks were actually very small pieces glued together lightly so that the bad guy could break them from the inside of his grave and it must have required quite a lot of people to put these fragile blocks in place so delicately as not to unglue them. Fortunately for the bad guy no one working at the cemetery noticed this.The film goes on very slowly after that. Anything they investigate is immediately followed by a long fight.Very often Conan Doyle writes about cases that although they look supernatural at the beginning, a sound and rational explanation is provided at the end.Guy Ritchie decides to change this tedious scheme, so that a crescendo is built till the last frame. To achieve this Guy Ritchie applies the rule that if a case looks supernatural, the explanation should be more supernatural than the case itself.So, at the end, we are faced with magical substances (that couldn’t be found till now even in the Pandora moon) like a kind of clear, odorless liquid, that people take as water, which ignites readily and violently with just a spark, distilled cyanhydric acid that kills much better than the relatively pure counterpart so easy to obtain, an antidote thanks to which you can breathe hydrogen cyanide with no ill effects, small sized remote controls made in 1880, and many, many more. No ridicule is spared in explaining what has happened and how.Such a display of fantasy for nothing";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Depp, Rush and McShane did a fantastic job at carrying the franchise to its fourth installment. There's plenty of laughs, some well choreographed action sequences, and it's a nice little tale of the search for the Fountain of Youth. This one is definitely up there with the first three films for me."", ""I had previously enjoyed the first and third of the Johnny Depp pirate movies though I was confused by some of the sequences. This one that I just watched with my movie theatre-working friend, I understood a bit more and, as a result, I enjoyed a little more especially with the addition of the beautiful Penelope Cruz as a former paramour who may or may not be on his side. There's also some good sequences with some mermaids that positively floored me with how they operate here. And the return of Geoffrey Rush as the one-legged crew member was also a treat here. Plenty of witty lines from Depp and some good swashbuckling sequences here and there were also good under new director Rob Marshall. So on that note, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is highly recommended."", ""I saw an advanced screening of this movie last night at the El Capitan theatre in Hollywood. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so all I'll say is that it was pretty darn good. By not having Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom in it, the film didn't feel like just a rehash of all the other PotC films. Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane really added a lot to the film, and I loved Sam Claflin's performance. But of course you have to have Johnny Depp, because it wouldn't be PotC without him, and Geoffrey Rush was spectacular as always. All in all, this has everything you'd expect from PotC: swashbuckling, sea creatures, sword-fighting, and lots of great comedy";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The reactions by the Prime Minister, defense minister, etc etc during Godzilla's initial appearance perfectly recreate the indecision that lead to more people being killed in that country than necessary during the real life disaster. In short, this movie uses Godzilla to satirize the Japanese government. A new, more decisive body of government forms in the aftermath and one end of it wants to evacuate Tokyo to Nuke him and the other wants to make a more experimental approach by analyzing Godzilla's body chemistry (the science is actually pretty good and leads to a surprisingly tense climax that involves construction cranes pumping hoses down Godzillas throat). The scenes with the humans are also shot in a very dynamic and fast paced way. Characterization suffers (Japanese films do this thing where they just add an odd quirk to a characters personality and call it a day) but its all for the purpose on finding out how to take care of the giant monster rampaging through the city while minimizing human casualties. Believably too, like how the government would actually react would it have happened.As for the big guy himself, Toho definitely plays around with him a lot. He's still a big green iconic monster, but they change his design more than I've ever seen before. When he first appears in the movie, he's more like a tadpole and over the film evolves into the monster we know. But even then he does things like opens his lower jaw when breathing fire like the predator, shooting beams from his dorsal fin and tail, and there's even a VERY chilling shot at the end involving Godzillas tail with some imagery with broader implications on what Godzilla is able to do. But for all these new things that happen, there's a bunch of stylistic choices that keep it rooted in its history. There's music being used from the original 50's score than ever before (they use more than just that classic brass theme), Godzilla still has his trademark roar, and when he breathes fire in a way we've never seen before (it starts as gas, lights up into a jetstream of flame, and then concentrates into a beam) there's a classic sound effect played that we haven't heard in ages. In short, there's a bunch of new and classic stylistic choices in equal measure. Plus the scene where he destroys Tokyo is, in a weird way, gorgeous to look at.In short, this is the smartest giant monster movie I've ever seen. It's not for everybody but it's certainly for people who understand what that means."", '""Shin Godzilla"" is a far departure from the usual Godzilla movie. With a darker tone and vastly different design of the titular monster, this movie isn\'t afraid to set itself aside from the more traditional monster movie, focusing more on the political side of things. While I at first thought this was unnecessary, it\'s important to note that this film was a representation of Japanese tragedies. Similar to how the original film was representative of the nuclear bombings of Japan, this film is representative of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, events heavily involved in political controversy. This isn\'t a perfect movie in any way, but I admire that bold steps it took to change. Honestly, probably one of the best Godzilla movies.', 'In 2004, after 28 films spanning 50 years, Toho Studios put the juggernaut Godzilla franchise on mothballs indefinitely, leaving lifelong fans such as myself in limbo as to whether we\'d ever see our favorite lizard king rise again. So when word about ""Shin Godzilla"" began to circulate, I was well stoked. Twelve years is a long time to wait for a resurfacing of my favorite monster, and the good news is that ""Shin Godzilla"" delivers the goods.I was fortunate to take in a screening of Toho\'s rebooted Godzilla last night. The film held more than a few surprises and is something of a fresh take on the execution of a Godzilla film, yet it honors its ancestors, to the point that much of the original ""Gojira"" music and sound effects are present and unmolested. On the surface, ""Shin Godzilla"" is a fairly standard entry into the franchise: Godzilla rises from the depths";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Muscle guys, muscle cars, hot chicks, and incredible action sequences. Not much has changed in the four films other than who the muscle guys wind up being played by but nonetheless, if you\'re going to the movies strictly to continually watch these things, then not only will this series run forever, but you should have no problem sitting through this fourth flick. Of course the other thing to look at here is the resurrection of Vin Diesel\'s action star persona, and considering he\'s been doing movies like ""Babylon AD"" and ""The Pacifier"" for the past couple years, you can basically say this is one of his better performances in a real long time.The plot is pretty thin but I\'m sure for fans of the first movie it will be nice to see the two leads back playing their roles. Diesel reprises wanted felon Dom Toretto, who after escaping at the end of the first movie seems to have started a new life in the Dominican Republic knocking over trucks. What brings him back to Los Angeles is revenge for the death of his girlfriend (Michelle Rodriguez) at the hands of brutal drug dealers led by Braga. This brings him face to face with the man who infiltrated his gang in the first flick, Brian O\'Connor (Paul Walker), now an FBI agent going after the same drug dealers. And wouldn\'t you know that driving plays a big part in Braga\'s whole smuggling operation so both Brian and Dom team up, amidst some trust issues, to bring down the drug cartel.Hopefully director Justin Lin (""Tokyo Drift"") gets the credit he deserves this time around. He\'s fantastic with these action sequences, not only making them pulse-pounding thrill rides but also letting you feel like you\'re in the car with these characters. The movie starts out brilliantly with a propane truck hi-jacking that turns life or death when things get out of control and the truck barrels down on the hi-jackers, and then just continues to go full throttle, staging a race on a crowded Los Angeles street and then chases in an underground tunnel shaft. Once these characters get in their cars you won\'t be bored for a moment.Outside the car is a different matter though. Both actors do what they can. Diesel is adrenaline personified. With his gravelly voice, bulging biceps, and cool, playful way around a line of dialogue, he\'s a lot of fun to watch. And while still pretty wooden, I admit that Walker has a pretty-boy face and an athletic physicality that makes him a good hero. This pairing worked well in the first movie, sort of like an amateur, yet entertaining, version of the adrenaline-seeking- cop and criminal formula a la ""Point Break."" Just after four movies it\'s all gotten stale and it\'s easy to see that the cars are the real stars here. The Dom-Brian conflict and Dom\'s vendetta against the cartel is mostly overshadowed and there isn\'t much for either character to do when away from their vehicles. Diesel and Walker try but they always seem to be a couple wheels short of competing with the four-wheel drive.""Fast and Furious"" deserves credit for doing the key things well. If your expecting much from anything other than the cars then it\'s a disappointment, but thanks to Justin Lin this has all the makings of a really thrilling action movie, making this fourth flick in the series a little bit better than its predecessors and a lot of fun.', ""Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) have escaped to the Dominican Republic and resume their criminal ways. However when the cops close in on Dom, he decides to leave everything behind including Letty. Later he finds that Letty has been killed while working for drug baron Braga who is using street racers to drive his drugs across the border. Only he doesn't know that Letty was working for Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) as an informant. Now Dom and Brian are both trying to get Braga by infiltrating his group as drivers.The family is back and the movie is so much the better for it. Director Justin Lin returns after Tokyo Drift. The franchise really missed the presence of Vin Diesel. The only minor disappointment are the car chases. They're good but just not great. They can be better. It's also sad to lose Letty so early on in the movie. It misses her energy."", 'I loved ""The Fast and The Furious."" Cars, ladies, cheesy lines and acting, crazy action = a groovy mix! Fast forward a few years and we finally have ""Fast & Furious""- the first true sequel! So much nostalgia! Seeing Vin, Paul, Michelle, and Jordana together again was fantastic! You can tell that these characters have grown since the first film. Brian is working on a case with the FBI that brings him in collision with Dom, who is back in the states seeking revenge for the murder of his gal Letty. This entry is definitely a bit heavy compared to the first few but that doesn\'t mean there isn\'t fun to be had! The opening sequence and the race at the middle of the film are two highlights! The tunnel sequences were not as good though, CGI being one of the reasons- still enjoyed it though! The F&F franchise isn\'t really known for stellar acting or writing or even realistic action sequences so it\'s no surprise that this sequel plays the same way. I think that\'s part of the charm of these movies, at least for me. Don Omar and Tego were hilarious, John Ortiz was good as the villain though not at all threatening, Fenix was just asking to get owned by that car in the end (what a way to go), and seeing Han from Tokyo Drift was a nice little treat. I had hoped we would see more of Gisele and we do in the sequels! That\'s a good thing!""Fast & Furious"" is a fun, dramatic, action-packed continuation of the franchise with some nice nods to the original that fans will appreciate. The ending got me so pumped for the next one!', ""I just got back from the midnight screening of 'Fast & Furious' and I have to admit the movie very much exceeded my fairly low expectations for the film. While the original film was entertaining, it was never a good movie by any means. Let's not even get started on the two that followed. The fourth installment however, is another story. Most of the original cast has come back and seeing them back in action together really makes you realize the F&F franchise isn't the same without them. The chemistry between the three leads (Diesel, Walker and Brewster) is the strongest it's been yet, and I would dare to call several of the scenes 'moving' as a result. Who would have ever expected that from Fast & Furious.The movie does an excellent job of keeping you on the edge of your seat, there's no shortage of action and a story that keeps your attention. The movie starts out in the DR with Vin Diesel pulling off a fairly implausible heist of hijacking a fuel tanker with his new crew. Minutes later, we learn of Letty's murder which in turn basically sets the tone for the rest of the movie as Diesel sets off on an all out rampage to even the score. Like the previous three, you certainly need to suspend your disbelief for the duration of the movie, however I was glad to see they didn't go overboard and kept the special effects and CIG to what seemed like a happy minimum.Anyone who's ever been a fan of the Fast and the Furious series will absolutely need to go see this on the big screen. Even if you weren't so hot for the originals, the movie is still worth a look. In my opinion it's acting, story, plot, special effects are the best of the series so far and almost makes it stand out as a respectable movie. Better yet, they've left the door wide open for 'Fast & Furious 5'. To be continued..."", ""with these movies coming out to the theatre every other year now, and now I just looked on this site fast n furious 7 2014. I need to catch up with the series. Paul Walker returns with Vin Diesel along with Michelle rodriguez for #4. there are a lot more bad guys in this film I thought the idea of the Mexican drug cartel presented a few new ideas. there is lot's of action to be had here, the gasoline tanker's explosion,, the chases with all of the cars in the Mexican tunnels, with the chopper in pursuit of all of the vehicles. I like the idea of using the border as a character in the movie. because apparently you can only be tracked for so long either before or after you get across the border, I forget how that works. but there is lot's of good one liners in here for our characters to chew up, love all of the fast cars and the faster women,, although I wonder how many of these movies can they keep making,, don't get me wrong I like them very much, but at some point you have to sit back and say , I think we need something else."", ""i thought this prequel to Tokyo Drift was actually not bad.it starts off with a real adrenaline rush.the racing scenes are pretty good,as are the chase scenes.the story was good,and flowed well.there are quite a few dramatic moments in this film and they all work well.most of the original actors form the first film in the series are back,including Vin Diesel,Jordana Brewster Michele Rodriguez,and Paul Walker.i don't think it was as good as the first film,but it was a close second.i added it to my collection,and don't regret it.if you're a fan of the series,you should like this one.for me,Fast & Furious is a well deserved 7/10"", ""Fast and Furious is certainly everything it promises, but that isn't a whole lot. We get all kinds of suped up cars that will give any sixteen year old the hots and the babes to make the illegal car racing all the more glamorous.Now when I say it's all babes and cars I mean it, there isn't any new character development in any of the characters and the action, while good, is extremely basic, but at least it isn't terrible.Entertaining for a viewing but it doesn't give us anything new to a franchise that has been extremely one note from the get go. Enjoy it and watch the racers act like rock stars! a very modest 6 out of 10"", ""Fast and Furious was a very good movie that had a darker and more serious tone than any of the prior films in the franchise. I loved seeing almost the entire original cast return and the amazing cars and impressive special effects that are a staple of the series return once again... granted, with a reduced emphasis on the cars themselves. The only real problem I had was that the continuity was broken a bit. *SPOILERS* Why, for example, is Paul Walker back in LA after the ending of 2 Fast 2 Furious? What happened to Tyrese's character? What happened to the rest of the crew from the original movie? These are not huge complaints but they did take away from the experience a bit. It's also evident that this film is a prequel to Tokyo Drift which was a little weird. Nonetheless, great film that is probably better than any of the prior ones other than the first of course."", ""Ridiculous opening sequence where they unhook the tankers on a 4-tanker gas transport rig in the Dominican Republic. Letty is running along the top of the tankers without falling off. Cars and pickup trucks going 70 mph in reverse and hooking up the tankers. Nicely shot, but completely ludicrous.The rest of the film was dumb, too. If Dom loved Letty, he wouldn't have left her in he middle of the night and not contacted her in 5 years. Brian is as awkward as a 15 year old throughout. The premise of driving through abandoned Mexican mine shafts at 80 mph was bizarrely dumb. At one point, Dom opened the door to his Charger and jumped into another car, commandeering it. All the while driving 80 mph in a mine shaft! I am not kidding!!! The ending was equally idiotic. Suffice it to say that prison buses have armed guards and police radios."", ""Once again, it follows the same plot points as some of the previous installments but Fast and Furious is still fun and its beginning to embrace the ridiculousness. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker give great performances and it's nice to see them back in the same film. John Ortiz is a really good villain. The action and car chases are also really good as usual."", ""So what is Fast and Furious? It's not a remake, or a reboot, and although it would appear to be a sequel it really is ultimately a recap to the very first film...or the second I forget. It has been so long since I've seen the original two films which this one is a direct follow up to. I kind of wish I had watched the first two before seeing this because it may have helped with the overall characters and plot. They do still try to link together not just the first two films but all the movies which I give them kudos for because I actually thoroughly enjoyed Tokyo Drift. So here comes Fast and Furious, barely changing the title from the first one but bringing back the original cast that defined the series. The thing that caught me the most about this film is it is not about car racing anymore. Really the film is about drug trafficking and despite a huge car/truck stunt in the first scene Fast and Furious lacks much of anything fast at all. All the other installments of the series have focused on the cars and the sexy sleek speed of everything but Fast and Furious tries to turn that around by giving it a different edge.Vin Diesel thrives in a Fast and Furious movie like this one or it's predecessors. It even brings out a little bit of actor in him. This is part of the reason I think he has trouble staying afloat in other films because he is Dominic Toretto. They really try to give him some depth in this installment which works okay but you really just want to see him race. I'm not sure he can do much else outside these movies. Paul Walker...remember when he was the IT boy? He returns to his role as tainted Federal Agent Brian O'Connor. Diesel and Walker still have oddly good chemistry together and they work better together as a crime fighting team then racing adversaries. Walker is not much different than he is ever been and just kind of looks pretty and does the bare minimum to stay afloat. Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez return to their roles in the film very briefly, enough to say they were there but give very little extra to the plot or their characters other than a little bit of sexual tension between Brewster and Walker who are like the power couple of the series. The villain of the film is played by John Ortiz and does a very solid job. If only the heroes of the film had the same depth this movie could have been as good as it's previous installments.Some people feel that the entire Fast and The Furious franchise is simply about cars and hot stars and if that is the only thing that holds this together and makes you want to see it than I suppose you won't be remotely disappointed in this one. The hot faces and cars are still there but without the same level of the street racing that the earlier one focused on. The only issue with this film is that they don't work on the existing characters at all. It's like they take the exact same characters from the first movie and port them into this movie with no continuation of them or growth to them. Diesel and Walker just feel very empty and you keep waiting for more of them. Fortunately the action and the work of director Justin Lin who has previously proved with mainstream films like Tokyo Drift and Annapolis that he can tell a great story without a lot of fluff or frills. There is nothing wrong with Fast and Furious except that it feels rushed and slapped together. It is very impressive that they were able to bring back everyone from the original film for the most part. Fans of the series will likely still be impressed. 7/10"", ""This movie isn't the best movie of all time it isn't great cinema it is not citizen kane or the godfather and not die hard, or ocean 11 for action crime movies but is is a very entertaining movie with a badass vin diesel\nthe acting is cheesy but the action and the cinematography is great in my opinion it is one of the best popcorn flicks it has explosions, car chases, racing, and a drug lord."", ""I just saw this and to be honest I was hesitant in buying the $8 matinée ticket but wanted to see a movie and figured what the heck. First of all the 1st film was good, IMO the sequel and then Tokyo Drift were pretty bad but the 4th installment gave a ray of hope when I first saw the trailer. I liked the fact that it had a large part of the original cast.I enjoyed this film and was surprised. They actually wrote a good story and it flowed very well, the action and driving scene's were shot and edited superbly, you did get the feeling that you were in the car at times which adds to the intensity of the driving scenes. I also like the fact that they incorporated American muscle cars instead of just imports this way the movie will appeal to people of all tastes. Overall I was pleasantly surprised of how good the film was. Also the final scene of Phoenix's demise was different than the norm. Bottom line Go see it."", ""A couple of nights ago I just got done watching F&F Tokyo Drift.....I wish they would've left that one out of this magnificent series. It made ZERO sense that they would do a sequel without any of the main people from the previous movie. I gave that one a rating 6 out of 10 and I was probably being too nice.But this one one, on the other hand.....brilliant. 9 out of 10!!!! The old characters are back, better story, better cars, better action.....awesome. The beginning had me clutching my chair and moving my head and body like I was actually there. Paul Walker (RIP)and Vin Diesel were amazing in this one as usual. It just gets me excited to watch the next one in the series.Show me a classic Dodge/Plymouth, and I will be a fan forever."", ""Every time there is a fight scene, car chase or action sequence the camera shakes around all over the place and you can't see what's happening. What's the point of that? I gave up trying to watch it because I got a damn headache... Grrr"", ""I was honestly so happy when this movie happened. I am a huge fan of The Fast And The Furious, and sadly, 2 Fast 2 Furious and The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift, did not meet my expectations. I just thought they changed too much. This movie brings everyone back, and the story goes back to where it was born and where it made fans love the sport of drag racing even more. This movie is pretty much about Dominic Toretto. He's a street racer and a thief, who is still wanted by the law and other criminals. He decides it's safer to cut himself off from everyone in his life, including his sister, Mia and his girlfriend, Letty. But after Letty is killed, things need to change. Brian O'Conner, Dominic's old friend, turned rival, turned friend, is still working at the FBI and decides that he'll help Dom get answers about Letty's death. They go undercover to uncover a drug-smuggler, who just happens to be connected to Letty.Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous."", 'When Dominic Toretto is informed that Letty was assassinated, he returns to Los Angeles to find her killer. His former friend and FBI agent Brian Conner is assigned to capture mysterious drug lord Braga that is looking for replacement drivers, working undercover as his courier, driving from Mexico to USA through the desert. Dominic discovers that Letty was working as a courier for Braga when she was killed and he decides to join his gang to find the killer......After the awful third movie, and the waning careers of the two leads, it was inevitable that this was eventually going to happen, and even though its lots and lots of fun, its bonkers beyond belief.Films like this are critic proof, they are all about fast cars, explosions, hot women and cool locations. Pretty much like a Michael Bay movie, but with taste.Diesel and Walker are not the best actors around, but their chemistry is undeniable, and they make a great pair. As with all sequels, they try to be bigger and better than the last one, and here it succeeds, because Lin knows these movies are ridiculous, so makes every set piece ridiculous also.So all in all, its a fine movie, totally off its rockers, but it knows it, and embraces it.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I really thought you were onto something different from your smash-em-up, shaky cam, action flick. The first hour of this film was excellent, but why did it have to become an action film with the moral fiber of Commando? In the beginning, we get the message that life, any life, is precious, then all the bad guys (even the not-so-bad guys) just start dropping like bricks, and we\'re supposed to feel happy when THAT happens. The initial chase scenes were great, but as time went by, they started to drag and then just became pointless.The final ""showdown,"" as it were, was not necessary at all. Whatever happened to the ""going to the media"" plan? He could have still got Johanson with him and made a pretty good case, considering her famous host was dying at the hospital at same that time. Then he would have had enough evidence to get people to actually listen to him, and enough support to return to that place of doom with a small army at the very least.But no, this is an action movie, so they must do this on their own, with a plan that required at least 95% dumb luck. And another thing, though we have improved on how we deal with the bad guy\'s demise in films since the 80\'s, many of us still think that the only way to deal with the bad guy is to kill him in a gruesome fashion, but really, wouldn\'t public exposure and shame have been better? Sean Bean had no time to even realize he had lost. Trust me, all he was thinking was ""I\'m in a lot of pain."" The Shawshank Redemption, though a different kind of film, dealt with its villain in a way that I think could have worked very well for this film too.As for the last scene (okay, second to last scene excluding the two of them on that stupid boat), ""Yay, they\'ve all escaped!"" Now what? They\'re in the middle of the desert, and nothing has been explained to them, so they\'re all completely confused. Great finish, Michael Bay. At the very least, let us see that the government allowed them all to live the rest of their days out on a real island. Sappy ending, I know, but much more rewarding than what we got. That wasn\'t even a finish to the right movie! It was the ending from the bloody Lion King! I hear you all on some of the plot holes, and most of them I could overlook and still enjoy the movie. But this ending killed it for me.', 'The Island is about the possibility, in the not too distant future, of a clone farm, for lack of a better term. When dealing with clones, especially in the movies, problems usually arise due to the lack of knowledge in the area. In this particular movie, it does not give away that they are clones too soon (unless you saw the preview). We are eased into their predicament slowly, although something is quite different and not right. At the beginning, I got sort of a Truman Show kind of feel to the movie, as they are always being watched, either by computers or cameras, and their lives are controlled in just about every detail.The clones are told that the outer world is contaminated and that the only safe place left is ""the island"". The only way to get to the island is through random lotteries where the lucky winner is whisked away to their new paradise.Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) is the first of the ""harvested beings"", as they put it, to start asking questions and even has distinct memories that were not embedded by the corporation. While wandering around, he soon discovers they have all been lied to. Meanwhile, one of his closest friends, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), has just won the lottery! Just as she is getting ready to leave, Lincoln grabs her away and starts running.The rest of the movie is pretty much a chase scene. One scene in particular closely resembles the one from Bad Boys II. That is not a bad thing, as it was still unique and fun watching the mass destruction.Both Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson did a fine job in their roles. Somehow, I do not remember Scarlett being as hot as she was in this film but maybe that is just the movie magic. Either way, she has a new fan. Also, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi and Sean Bean did fine jobs with their roles. Duncan\'s role was pretty small but his performance was very strong and relevant to the story.I was reminded of many movies while watching this one. One scene, while showing the harvesting, was closely resembling The Matrix. Also, one of the reasons I liked this movie so much was the ingenuity involved with inventions of the future. From innovated trains to literal desktop computers (that was awesome) to cars and even to an X-Box, those little things sprinkled all through the movie kept my eyes on the screen. Similar to I, Robot.Although I would not have considered myself a fan of Michael Bay, after seeing this movie and realizing what other movies he is also responsible for (minus Pearl Harbor), I can say that I like his work and am looking forward to his upcoming Transformers project. 8.5/10', ""I have every movies of Michael Bay, and I got to say \x96 this is probably his best. Though the story is nothing new and it has a lots (loads) of resemblances of his previous work";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It has some intense action sequences. Actually, a lot of intense action sequences. The shooting never stops and the explosions keep on coming. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are hysterical, again. And Joe Pantoliano makes every movie better. The two funniest scenes are when Burnett and Lowery are scaring the hell out of Burnett's daughter's date and after the chase scene with the dead bodies and Captain Howard goes off on the two. Absolutely hilarious! My only gripe is that it seemed that the writers were running low on material and resorted to gross-out humor like rats having sex and corpses losing their heads. Not funny. Otherwise it was very funny, due to the amazing chemistry between the two leads. I still prefer the original Bad Boys, but this is still a great time at the movies. 7/10"", ""Bad Boys II doesn't reinvent the wheel, it just makes it bigger, faster, and more attractive. The film is little more than a collection of high intensity action scenes with a tons of irreverent humor and mild characterization tossed in between. It's slick, high energy fun and a huge success for what it is and wants to be, which is, essentially, the quintessential Michael Bay experience."", ""Bad Boys II takes everything the last film did and ups it to the next level. The action is fast paced and a lot of fun without being too ridiculous. The comedic pairing of Smith and Lawrence is even better here because of the time that's past to make their relationship feel more authentic. Unfortunately, the film's runtime is also increased by nearly 30 minutes from the previous film and its mostly unnecessary filler moments that feel like they don't have much bearing on the actual plot. Granted a couple of these scenes are fun (we all love that Reggie scene) but most just bring the film to a crawl."", ""Bad Boys 2 is basically what you'd expect. Everything from the original gets amped up. The story is more ridiculous and less contained. There's no restraint here just pure Bay indulgence. This movie is bonkers but it knows exactly what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. I can respect that and I appreciate this movie more than the original for that very reason."", ""Like it's prequel, 'Bad Boys II' is not the sort of film you should watch if you like deep-thinking, philosophical dramas. But if you're just wanting to be entertained by plenty of action, sarcastic jokes and wisecracks then this is a perfect blockbuster for you.It doesn't pretend to have some deep plot-- the storyline is the very simple premise of catching the drug dealers and getting the girl-- but it is pure popcorn entertainment complete with car chases and gun fights. The interplay between Will Smith and Matthew Lawrence is hilarious (the 'Bad Boy' films are the only time I can tolerate Lawrence)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To the point of 80's clunkers where cheese was heavily spread throughout many films. As title of review suggests, this seems like a project that Nic Cage missed out on. With Nic amped up to 11, it may have proven to be a fun film. Unfortunately, those involved seemed to be seriously thinking the loose writing, poorly chosen film score and bad acting were what audiences were hoping for. Here's hoping Ben washes the grime off and gets back to delivering some decent entertainment. For now, this film certainly won't be added to my blu-ray collection."", ""This is a B movie all the way. It has Ben Affleck, but it's still a B movie. The budget was $70M but it's still a B movie. They really tried to create something creative, so I give them credit. That being said, it just didn't work. That's why the studio buried the investment.Nolan likes to create extremely complex plots, with wild ideas that can alter time, space, perception, reality, memory and in this case the ability to control others thoughts thorough ESP.It's just way to complex given the cast, locations and the overall premise. It's similar to SCANNERS from 1981. The idea is, but it lacks that 80s vibe, practical special effects and it's just confusing and too short given all there is to unpack. 5.2/10 for the idea and some clever scenes."", ""Danny Rourke is a police detective whose daughter was abducted. A bank robbery has an unusual element: an individual is able to exert incredible hypnotic control over strangers. These people are known as hypnotics, and it turns out that there may be a connection with his daughter's disappearance.This film, starring Ben Affleck and directed and co-written by Robert Rodriguez, poses mysteries right from the start and, throughout its length, answers them and raises more questions. In short, it's a decent sci-fi tinted thriller, with loads of twists and turns, many of them very satisfying. Affleck seems like he's having great fun and William Fichtner, as usual, is a great villain.Or is he?Hmm...."", 'I\'m not really sure why everybody hates this so much. I read a few reviews that said there were huge plot holes, I didn\'t find that at all. There was only unanswered question for me and that is simply...were they born with it or are lots of people and it just an untapped brain function, that under the right circumstances can be honed? But everything from the opening scene after was answered! And it was answered very clearly. So either they didn\'t finish it or they weren\'t really watching, as they were watching. As far as the acting goes, I mean I\'ve seen worse and I\'ve seen better. But it was it wasn\'t such pitiful acting that I\'d give a one star review for it. It really just centers around a several main characters and they all do a decent job. It\'s not an Emmy winner by any means but it\'s still a watchable movie. And if you are among the groups who believe the ""government"" tells us what they are doing, through channeling entertainment to program us, then I would say you\'d like it even more. Because who\'s to say things like this aren\'t happening right now. Programming subjects for mass shootings comes to mind haha.', ""If this movie had been made when Rodriguez first thought of it, Nobody would be crapping on it. It is a very good movie, it's just not wholly original. Despite that, I thought it was executed very well. I didn't see the ending coming and was very shocked/impressed. I liked that it's an amalgamation of movies that have come before it. I also think affleck and Braga played their roles well of playing innocent before the twist comes. I have a learning disorder so I appreciated the exposition but I can see how others felt dumbed down. I think people under appreciate affleck's subtle acting but I'm also one that prefers scarecrow as a Batman villain to joker."", 'I don\'t ever write reviews, but goodness.I went to see this as one of the Regal Monday Mystery Movie promotions so I had no idea I was going to see this, and when I say it was bad believe me. It was bad.The writing is so lackluster, acting is awful, you can tell Ben Affleck is zoned out the entire movie due to poor script, and the frequent ""plot twists"" had every viewer in that theater confused because none of them made any sense to the story or would just retcon the previous one which made no sense to anyone.Almost every viewer was laughing about thirty minutes in due to how bad it was.', ""Robert Rodriquez has been making a mix of films since From Dusk Till Dawn some are gold like The Faculty, Sin City is a dark masterpiece, Planet Terror is another awesome one, I even grew up loving Spy Kids trilogy even though those might not be appreciated and Alita:Battle Angel is great. I might be a big fan of his films and enjoyed Hypnotic a fair bit sure it's got some bits that can be hated easily but the mind-bending nature and Illusions are enough to me enjoy quite a lot! Ben Affleck is solid, I would say he's done better like his recent film Air is a gem. I was surprised a couple teenagers saw this and they hated the movie maybe it's to complex for some or something else it's defiantly great entertainment!"", '**SPOILER ALERT**I\'ve never been a big Affleck fan. However, his performance in, ""The Tender Bar,"" impressed me enough to give him another chance. So without reading a synopsis or review or even watching a trailer, off I went, to see ""Hypnotic.""\nNo more than 15 mins in, I was wriggling in my seat. Affleck had returned to the stilted, one-dimensional and boring actor that I remembered all too well. His 1 1/2 kinds of facial expressions got old, fast. His partner had way more energy thank God.I guess about an hour in, I realized that I was watching a poorly stitched together amalgam of ""Inception,"" ""Shutter Island,"" ""The Truman Show,"" ""Memento"" and another film whose name now escapes me. Even with borrowing material and concepts from these other better movies, ""Hypnotic"" still couldn\'t find its footing as a credible or serious film. Note, I like Alice Braga a lot. She definitely injected some life but not enough to counter Affleck\'s smug,\nlifeless performance.I was not alone. The audience around me was laughing in disbelief right along with me. I could hear sighs and audible comments like, ""Oh c\'mon"" and ""This is so stupid."" I could not disagree.Hoping for the end, it came eventually. Even that was long and drawn out. What were they doing?I got outta there as soon as the word ""Hypnotic"" appeared on the screen, signaling the END.I couldn\'t help but think of Affleck\'s best friend Matt Damon, seen in the ""Oppenheimer"" trailer preceding this film. He is so far ahead of Ben as a performer. That\'s why he\'s starring in what will surely be one of the biggest summer movies that actually has substance and grit, to come along in quite awhile. Even in ""Air,"" Affleck is once again playing a smug character. No stretch there. And Damon is well, so much better.', ""After telling his therapist of his horror at the apparent snatching of his daughter, cop Ben Affleck returns to duty. Picked up by his partner he attends a bank robbery which seems to involve a man instructing many innocent people to carry out actions in support of the robbery.Frankly, if you've seen Inception and Total Recall you'll have enough experience to understand roughly where this might be going. As with similar films it starts out shrouded in mystery and I guess in many respects, this element is the most fun. However at a 90 minute running time very quickly the mind bending type mystery clears up and the climax is largely as expected. Fun enough, but unremarkable."", 'So about 20 minutes into this movie I thought it was terrible. Affleck\'s acting is particularly bad, and there\'s plot holes big enough to drive a bus through, and it just kind of felt like a bad movie that I\'d suffer through till the end, but then something happened.... the ""reveal"" around the hour mark. Suddenly all those plot ""holes"" weren\'t actually plot holes, and Affleck\'s ""bad"" acting wasn\'t actually bad at all. That\'s the point. It\'s SUPPOSED to watch like a terrible movie because that sets up the reveal. I hate to say it, but that nuance once u know the reveal is kinda brilliant. Affleck in particular is acting badly... ON PURPOSE! And you\'re supposed to notice those plot holes and be like ""Wait, how is that possible?"". Those are the clues to the reveal.So yeah, is it the best movie ever? No. But anyone writing a bad review (in particular criticizing Affleck\'s acting) just doesn\'t understand that that was the assignment.', ""We find out why later, but it did the movie no favors and the movie never recovers.Mr. Rodriquez is no Christopher Nolan. I really wanted to like this movie, but what appeared, rightly or wrongly, to be weird direction and/or acting at the beginning set the tone for the audience's perception, so when the movie picks up some it never really picks up completely or feels realistic...Other realism problems - Everyone gets blasted away. But no blood or blood splatter? Oh come on! The mixmatched agents in their red jackets making no effort to get cover? Oh come on! That's supposed to be the realistic part!Ben Affleck couldn't decide to play it straight or like a superhero. They left it open for part 2, but that ain't gonna happen. Too bad, because it really could have been good. I get it now as to why the acting seemed so...off, but then it really didn't get any better. A 1.5 half movie that felt like 3 hours.I give in a 7 although it really didn't deserve it."", ""So again I put this off a while but I found myself guessing so I fired it on and I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it especially after seeing the SHOCKING reviews.So it's about a detective who wants to find his daughter, he encounters a man who can do hypnosis and seems to have information on her whereabouts, he must follow this thread which leads him down a spiral of mystery.The movie is grand, nothing amazing but it's a decent and easy watch, there were times when it lost me a little and I found parts a bit cheesy but that's okay, it's not a bad movie, don't be expecting Prisoners level of story and drama.It is around a 6.5 for me as it was pretty good, I probably wouldn't watch again but it's an enjoyable 1 watch for something to throw on. 6.5/10."", ""I hope this isn't the beginning of another all time great actor ruining his career and reputation signing up for incredibly bad scripts. Nic Cage, Bruce Willis... Ben Affleck? I don't know what would possess him to read this script and think this is anything but corny. Everybody .......talks.....so......slow...... with so many slow dramatic monolgues over-explaing it's concept on everything. It's just bad. People are 'hypnotized' into becoming killers. It's like a zombie movie without the ugly. Or the zombie appeal.The movie jumps from one inconsistent plot twist after another that are inane and predictable. The ending is nonsensical, he hides his daughter away so that she can't be trained to be a hypnotic, yet she turns out to still be the most powerful hypnotic with no training, forcing all the bad guys to have the ultimate show down and gun each other down. And she's only about 11 years old. Yay good wins! Wait nope- then there's a completely different ending AFTER the credits roll (I only know this because I was preoccupied during the entire movie so when the movie was over I didn't turn it off right away). Evil wins! Did I just watch 2 movies in 1? Even the music is hackneyed and annoying.I watched the movie through because I like Ben Affleck and William Fichter. But I didn't like it. At all. 1 star for Ben. 1 for William= 2 stars.Don't fall in the trap Ben!""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I mean, it's crap, but it's good crap, and that's worth a lot. The premise is basically Speed meets D.O.A. (the 1950 movie starring Edward O'Brien). Jason Statham (of the Transporter movies) is a hit-man who has a lethal Chinese poison coursing through his veins. If he slows down, if his adrenaline level drops, he drops dead. In his last moments, he rushes to find his killer and others responsible, snatching as many energy drinks and drugs as he can get his hands on along the way. This is some fun stuff, and hilarious, too. The editing is the MTV-style of many modern action movies, so avoid it if you can't stand that. I hope the directors, who also wrote the script, succeed even more so in the future."", 'This movie really is fully packed with action and humor. it has  everything that can keep your heart pumping for the whole movie.  A hit-man chasing and killing bad guys with guns knives and everything  he can find. there is a lot of gunfight and explosives. But the movie  really is funny too. the whole crowd in the theater were laughing out  loud here at the ""avant-première"" in Montreal.  during the opening sequence, some dizziness begin to overwhelm you  because of a shaky and blurred camera but i guess this is exactly what  the director was expecting. This ""shaky hand"" camera effect is reused  throughout the movie adding to the perspective and helps one get  plunged in the movie.  The special effects are mainly car crashes and explosions, but are  really well executed and very inventive. And the story, well, the story  isn\'t really what you seek when choosing to go see this kind of movies,  but in crank, the storyline is actually pretty good. It could probably  be resumed in half a page though :)  I would say that it is one of the most balanced humor/action movie i\'ve  seen in the past years.', 'Fast. Hyper. Action-packed. Drug-induced. Insane. Crank is all these things, and extremely entertaining too. No doubt a movie made just for the guys, it\'s filled with guns, car chases, sex, random humor, nudity, Amy Smart, Pedro from Napolean Dynamite, sex, nudity, etc. The only thing missing were some hand-to-hand fight scenes that would have made this movie complete. Instead, we do get a nice confrontation where one person is armed with a butcher\'s knife... but I shan\'t spoil that one.But yes, this is a live-action video game on the big-screen. Google Maps zooms into the next location Chev visits and on screen text gives you its name ala a video game\'s ""next level"" sequence. Chev\'s girlfriend thinks he is a video game programmer. The opening titles for ""CRANK"" are shown in the blocky, pixellated style of a 1980\'s Atari game. Chev is just trying to get to the boss at the end of the game.And a tip for those of you yet to see it- STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS. It reinforces everything I just said.', ""If Crank were to take itself seriously, it would be the most unpleasant movie ever. Thankfully, it's so over-the-top and so stylized that any chances of taking it seriously get immediately thrown out the window.What you're left with is an insane action movie that overloads your senses and keeps you watching for two reasons: One is because it's legitimately entertaining, and the other is out of curiosity of just what new GTA-level insanity will it do next."", ""If you like brainless action flicks with insane set-pieces, great one-liners and zero character development so you don't give a rat's-ass about them, then Crank is probably the film for you. It is done originally, like a computer game where the action supersedes the plot. It keeps the film moving and the viewer entertained at the same time at the ridiculous and extreme scenarios and this is all the directors want Crank to do. Everything, including generic realism, convincing plot and background characters plays second-fiddle to the stylised action and I couldn't help but be entertained, especially at the completely unsubtle contemporary culture-clash comedy references!6/10"", 'Back in the 1990s British action star Gary Daniels was at the height of his fame. Headlining a string of bland, stunt filled features for PM Entertainment (the B Simpson/Bruckheimer). In 1996 he starred in RAGE, a non-stop action movie with a very ""high concept"" premise. Injected with a deadly drug an ordinary man becomes a one man army. Hunting down the bad guys, on the run from the cops and trying to get his normal life back - the film was stunt filled madness. 10 years later we have CRANK which is essentially a rehash. Albeit a big budget, MTV-style version. Our hero is still a Brit, the location is once again Los Angeles, but there are gangster movie connotations, wild visuals and a tongue-in-cheek tone (you cannot take the name Chev Chelios seriously and I don\'t think you\'re supposed to) which makes this a lively, engaging ride which knocks Daniels\' effort for six. The similarities between the two cannot be ignored but this is clearly the superior of the two. RAGE was the prototype, but CRANK takes it to the limit with set-pieces and jokes as silly as they are inventive. In addition there are connotations to films such as Tony Scott\'s MAN ON FIRE and DOMINO and Brit gangster movies such as Mike Hodges\' GET CARTER and Guy Ritchie\'s LOCK, STOCK and TWO SMOKING BARRELS which add to the thrills and keep us entertained. Much more restrained than CGI-filled, action pantomime that was TRANSPORTER 2, CRANK is Statham\'s best star vehicle yet. He\'s a pure physical presence with a maniacal glint in his eyes. There are no Corey Yeun-style martial arts scenes but it doesn\'t matter. The film is OTT but somehow grounded. The action is rough, fierce. Statham\'s character is a relentless one man army in classic tradition. Young guys and longtime action movie fans are going to love this for its sheer vigour. With creativity in the genre previously limited to new twists on chases and fight scenes, it\'s a real pleasure to see films such as CRANK, ONG-BAK and BANLIEUE 13 (District 13) emerging. Not to be taken too seriously, Crank is one of the best popcorn movies of 2006.', 'The movie had my attention from the first moment, how it started and how the movie continued having my attention and forcing me to focus without passing a scene, a great acting from Jason Statham.Such good work at all.', 'Did see Crank. And I loved it. Fun, crazy, unexpected, twisted, action, sad, happy and totally weird. The story is so tight and adrenalin packed that it is a unbelievable sight indeed. I did sit in my couch with eyes peeled every minute. Have to say that I really did not believe I would get such a nice movie for the evening. Compared to many other action movies this one really stick out from the rest.And Jason Statham did a fantastic role in Crank. I loved him in The Transporter and The Transporter 2.I highly recommend it. Though have in mind that it is some heavy action with some strong scenes in it.', ""What a disappointment. I really look forward to Jason Statham movies as he has all the tools to be a major action star. He is fit, projects a great screen charisma and knows enough martial arts to allow for nicely choreographed fight scenes. But his movies continue to be weak. Well, his previous movies seemed weak at the time but, compared to this stinker, they rocked.He may have jumped at this movie based on the script. I can imagine getting excited just reading the screenplay. The premise is not original by any means, but still nifty: he wakes up with a video love note from enemy gangsters letting him know that he has one hour to live due to a designer poison in his system. A nice touch was the video showing them administering the drug while he was asleep. There is apparently no cure but the death can be delayed by keeping his adrenaline up. The script then lends itself to what could have been nicely over-the-top moments involving him starting fights he cannot hope to win, having sex with his girlfriend in front of a cheering crowd of Chinatown onlookers, mutilating himself with a waffle iron, starting police chases and generally embarking on what the news station in the movie called a city-wide spree of destruction.All of these scenes with so much potential were wasted in the unimaginative hands of director Mark Neveldine. He goes through every clichéd tool available: fast edits, fast pans, odd tilts, slow-mo, etc., all supported by a fast, generic soundtrack. Okay, granted, pretty much all action movies use these tools but, in the good ones, the directors use them imaginatively and well. Neveldine did neither. If the Cardinal Sin of any movie is to boring, how much worse is it for an action movie to suffer that? The movie is barely workable. I don't believe it even lends itself to the enjoyment of picking it apart with friends. Statham does maintain his favorable screen presence, but very little else. Amy Smart is not terribly attractive here. That's got to be the movie as she looks charming in other venues (see: The Best Man and Just Friends, though she was out-shined by Anna Faris in the latter). Efren Ramirez is always enjoyable, including his violently brief role here. For much better examples of his talent see Napolean Dynamite and Employee of the Month.I'd really recommend a pass on this movie."", ""One of the funniest and coolest film I've ever seen, story was simple and short, the jokes were sickly humorous";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Just take it like this: It\'s a movie of Bruce Willis and his team of misfits attempting to save the world by going to outer-space and blowing up a giant asteroid that\'s hurtling towards earth. PS. Liv Tyler at 21 y/o was unbelievably beautiful... she\'s distractingly gorgeous in the movie.', 'After discovering that an asteroid the size of Texas is going to impact Earth in less than a month, NASA recruits a misfit team of deep core drillers to save the planet.The real mystery surrounding this film is how it got released by the Criterion Collection. Both this film and Michael Bay\'s ""The Rock"" received the Criterion treatment at one time. And while both are very enjoyable films, do they really belong with Criterion? I feel that by merely being released by them, there is an added importance stamped on the film.But as far as guilty pleasures go, this is a fun and entertaining film. I could do without the romance angle, but the idea of blowing up an asteroid before it hits earth (which assumes a lot of questionable science) is just classic science fiction, here given more legitimacy and budget than ever before.', ""Typical Michael Bay movie, lots of action and things explode really for no reason. It's still a fun flick. So many actors in it."", '*minor spoilers* This film follows the basic asteroid going to hit earth plot. They find out about the asteroid, some brave souls are sent to destroy it, they get into problems, and one has to die to save the planet. With one major twist. Does NASA send a group of highly trained astronauts to save the earth from destruction? No. instead they call on Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his gang of oil drilling misfits. This happy gang are rounded up from a strip club, casino and various other hideouts, to save the world.This makes from a many laughs and eventually a ""happy ending"". If you want a serious film about saving the planet, don\'t watch this. Its way to far fetched, and has far too many funny moments to be taken seriously. This is great entertainment. For example when the mad Russian astronaut hits the space shuttles engine with a spanner to get it started! Hilarious. Steve Buscemi\'s character provides some of the films funniest moments. The acting\'s OK and the special effects are great.If you want a far fetched, over the top, voyage into space with the strangest bunch of astronauts around, watch this film. Don\'t take it seriously, don\'t expect it to be realistic, just sit back and watch it.', ""This movie seems to be a movie that many people love to hate.  I don't see why it has such a bad reputation.  It is meant to be an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie, and it definitely lives up to this.  It is what it is. Many people have tried to compare it to Apollo 13, but that's like comparing apples and oranges.  They are entirely different fruit. Apollo 13 is based on a true historical event (Docu-drama), while Armageddon is an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie.  It has plenty of action and adventure, a lot of humor, and a bit of romance.  Is the story realistic? Not hardly, but name ANY Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie that is.  That's why they call it Science FICTION... For those who criticize this movie, nothing will change their minds. However, if you HAVEN'T seen Armageddon, take a chance, watch with an open mind and try not to let all these negative reviews spoil your enjoyment of a really fun movie.  Remember, a movie is meant to ENTERTAIN, and Armageddon does just that, if you let it!"", ""This film is unashamedly corny. Unrealistic with a cheesy end but it's entertaining. And when the people giving this 2's, 3's & 4's should politely remove their heads from their asses if their problem was lack of realism. It's pure cheesy entertainment so just enjoy it and don't over think it."", 'Even though my father treated me to Armageddon I felt as if I\'d wasted my own money. I felt so bad, I apologized to him as we walked out. This movie was so bad I wouldn\'t recommend anyone to watch it if the could see it for FREE. It was long, stupid, non-entertaining, and horrible. This and GODZILLA were two of the worst movies made in recent years. Why cant more of these ""blockbusters"" have the same thrills, heart, and wit as the STAR WARS series. Hollywood should realize that there\'s a reason these movies are so popular.DO NOT GO SEE ARMAGEDDON!!!!!', ""I'll say it straight out, this movie let me down quite a lot. I wanted an epic badass of a film that would revolutionize the way I see movies. I got an epic behemoth of a film with more then ample doses of goofy monkeying around inserted sometimes at the most inappropriate of scenes. Bruce Willis stars in this movie along with Ben Afleck and Liv Tyler as two young lovers, and it's safe to say that there aren't too many complaints with the acting (although admittedly there were some weak spots there, too).No, my main problem with this movie is the comedy. Now, I'm all for comedy, but the directors of Armageddon didn't seem to be taking their own plot too seriously at some point. I was in awe at the utter stupidity of the characters in this movie, especially toward the second half of it, and specifically Rockhound (Steve Buscemi, who does do a very good job acting here anyway). We all need some lighthearted fun in our movies, but what we don't need is for the comedy to interfere with the dramatic parts of the movie, which it almost does a few times here. Rockhound's foolishness and monkeying around almost ruins several scenes and it doesn't fit with the whole theme of saving the Earth. Why did they even put the parts involving the stripper and then later the machine gun on the asteroid into the movie? It's safe to tell who we can all throw rocks at for ruining the movie. Why on earth is he so lenient about it? It makes no sense. I can say the same thing for most of the crew at the beginning, too, they seem awfully laid back for a bunch of guys about to go save the world. Bear was falling asleep and making comments about a hot girl during the teaching sessions. What? Like I said, I like comedy fine, but here it just hinders what would otherwise be a phenomenal movie.This movie is full of explosions (big explosions, too, we're not talking about little buildings. We're talking entire cities all at once here. That's epic.), romantic love scenes, and other action clichés. They're actually done quite well, until we get Rockhound or Bear making more dumbass jokes. The whole mishmash makes Armageddon look like a PARODY of the action genre at some points, and it hurts the score. A lot. If I were to see this movie without any prior knowledge of action movies, and having never seen one before this, I would get a flawed first impression of the genre. It's not quite to the level of Scary Movie and Date Movie, of course, but it's not an upstanding example of how to incorporate comedy into an action movie. See Die Hard 3 or The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly for that. Sorry, but Armageddon just goes too far overboard sometimes.No, I don't hate this movie though. I do like it quite a lot. It's great fun for a Saturday night with friends or if you've been drinking (lol). The ending scenes with Willis and Afleck are very touching, as are most of the scenes involving Liv Tyler. It's also got some extremely triumphant moments, and the explosions and special effects are amazingly done. Check out those skies toward the end! The scenes with Chick (Will Patton) and his ex-wife and son are extremely touching, and are the saving grace of the quieter parts of the movie. Beautiful. And like I mentioned before, it's EPIC. In all caps, too. There aren't many other movies like this that can touch it in epic-ness. Not even Die Hard or it's sequels are more epic than this monster of a film.Recommended to action fans who can stand stupidity in their movie-viewing. I'll be watching this one again, too."", ""Beastly movie on so many different levels. action, intensity, suspense, creativity, acting (mostly), likable characters, comedy, music, emotional parts, love story, getting you emotionally invested. never once bored on a 2.5 hour movie. you definitely have to turn your brain off, but if you do, you'll have a great time. and this movie gives me the feels. hard core. numerous times.

A fast paced masterpiece by Michael Bay, the music is top notch, and there are many great moments. I've seen it countless times and I just LOVE it!"", ""There are things wrong with Armageddon, but I don't think it is a bad movie. In fact I think it more as a guilty pleasure. It is shallow in the character development, the film is much too long by twenty minutes not helped by the sappy love-story subplot and Ben Affleck got on my nerves. With its faults it is entertaining, and I do think it is better than Pearl Harbor, which had amazing spectacle but was bloated and had an awful script. So what makes Armageddon entertaining? Well, the visuals are incredible, and the music is great. I liked the script, clichéd it may be but there was enough tongue-in-cheek for me to be entertained by, and the film realises it's a parody and that it is politically incorrect something those talentless hacks Friedberg and Seltzer should have already learnt by now. The direction is decent, and the acting was good, Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton and Steve Buschemi coming off best. Overall, no masterpiece by all means, but it is not Michael Bay's worst movie and definitely not the worst movie ever. 7/10 for the entertainment value and the visuals alone.

The main point of a movie is to entertain the audience. Admittedly, on the surface it is about as schmaltzy, bubble gum, and simplistic as can be. Maybe that was Michael Bay's whole point. The movie had great special effects. The audience was entertained for the whole movie. No time for boredom. The best part were the silly quips and one liners that the actors said. They were not real astronauts. They were oil workers, and they were not afraid to whine and express their frustrations about their lot trying to save the Planet. The message was to never give up, and to trust yourself and your team. It was a bad cliched movie, but maybe it was really poking fun and having fin satirizing all disaster movies. So, I will not say it is Academy Award material, but the movie entertained."", 'I saw this film last night.And I\'m worried I\'m turning into one of those left-wing liberals they rightly make fun of in South Park. Because I found it hugely offensive. Am I being ridiculously sensitive? Firstly, there\'s the old staple that is America being the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything, ever.Secondly, and chillingly, there is the early meteor strike hitting some (unnamed \x96 why do they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to this is to look at it as a warning. As in ""my god, imagine the tragedy that *could* happen"". Because, you know, it happened to Asians. It might happen to white Americans, and *that* would be tragic.Then, later on, a bigger meteor hits Paris. Our cast on the ground are irritated, because this might mean our boys have less time than they thought. Not much upset in America. No mention that a lot of people have died.Then there\'s Michael Clarke Duncan. A wonderful actor, wasted. Never has a black man been so token. Among a team of hardcore drillers, his job seems to consist of standing in the back, occasionally saying ""Hey, you da man."" Really. Why did they even bring him? It\'s not like he\'s petite - he weighed down that shuttle for nothing! Not once does he lift a tool, steer a space ship or even help fix anything that blows up.Even if you ignore the Russian Cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great actor wasted in a pointless role), who seems drunk most of the time and hits things with spanners instead of fixing them because ""Dat\'s how we do dese dings in Russia"", it\'s pretty horrific.All cemented of course by the site of blond, blue-eyed American children all celebrating in corn fields at being saved and everything being all right. Because all the death and destruction to the rest of the world is irrelevant.You expect the bad script, the dodgy acting, the implausible plot (fat, middle aged men being trained in 12 days to be astronauts? Including one who appears to be retarded?). But I couldn\'t believe the racism and xenophobia implied in the film, and the callous disregard for the lives of anyone not corn-fed American.It\'s a chilling indictment of the attitude of a section of Western Society to the world.And it\'s a crappy film too.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The visuals are a wonderful evolution from Tron and the story of a father and son who have to make up for lost time is very touching. The CGI face they developed for Jeff Bridges is not perfect, but it works very well with just a few exceptions and I feel, for my own tastes, that they have actually bridged the uncanny valley with this one. Still a bit of work to get it perfect, but this one works as it is. Oh, and the score by Daft Punk is beautiful. The first thing my brother and I did after leaving the theater was buy the sound track on the way home. It's very suggestive of the original but with plenty of today's newer sensibilities mixed in."", ""Great great movie always get chills from the music and when he first uses the bike. Love the atmosphere of Sam Flynn's life and how much love he has for his father at the end of the movie. Fantastic message in the movie where we as people think things are important in our life such as work or possessions but nothing is more important then family 👍."", 'The original movie was generic. While it\'s far from bad, it\'s plot was simplistic in terms of the overall focus being on the good vs evil side and less on the thematic element it established of Flynn and all users being gods. It serves as a mythology, however, to a much more insightful legend which unfolds in this movie. But the problem is, due to the somewhat simplistic nature of the predecessor, people failed to give attention to the themes of this film, preferring to focus on the generic side as that\'s what they\'d expect from a Tron movie. But the movie doesn\'t stay generic, so when viewers find nothing simple to see they assume the movie is empty. It\'s not, they\'re minds are just preset to look for simple ""turn off your brain and be entertained"" values, which simply aren\'t present in this film.The whole movie, just like the original, is similar to the idea of a religious mythology. The original featured programs as disciples of the users, enslaved for their belief. But that plays a small role overall. Here, when the Grid is reprogrammed to the image of Kevin Flynn, Flynn is established to the status of ""the one true god"" at least of this version of the grid, and all the other users who contribute new programs are just angels. But the maker of this world is Flynn, regardless of whether or not he writes the fates of these people. So, much like the original Hebrew form of god, he is not so much a ruler who demands worship or enforce any rules but just a wise and experienced being here to help when he\'s needed.And it\'s not so much an analogy to call Flynn god as it is TRUE. He has successfully created a world, not a platform. A world that\'s self sustaining and requires no more intervention of the users, as displayed by the ISOs which created themselves and were programmed by no-one.And this demands many questions! If they\'d been allowed to live, would the ISOs have made this world like our own in thousands of years? Does this mean that\'s how our own god could have created our own world and how we came to be? Questions of such layered nature can\'t simply be ignored as style over substance.And then there comes CLU, the best friend of Flynn who he trusted. But as god, I dare say it, may have been somewhat confused in his image he had for the world in his early form, so did Flynn suffer from this same confusion of image for his world. This causes CLU to suffer a similar fate of uncertainty, making him only able to understand that his god is incapable of creating a perfect world since he can\'t imagine one. Thus, taking matters into his own hands, he abandons his god and does what he sees to be right. But the problem is he expects to get a different result with the same thinking as his flawed god, the only thinking he has been exposed to, and makes even worse mistakes than his god, making Flynn see the errors of his ways. Thus, a most appropriate analogy, CLU becomes the Satan to Flynn\'s god.But the ultimate piece of symbolism that outmatches anything else in the movie, is the final attempt of CLU to get Flynn\'s disc. He realizes Flynn has tricked him, by giving the disc he sought to his son. He discovered that the son of Flynn, and thus the son of a god, has obtained the disc and power he seeks, and thus he must obtain it. There is so much symbolism that flies past viewers in what happens next. When CLU realizes he has been tricked, he raises his disc to derez Flynn and then go get the right one, but only violently places the disc beside Flynn, subtly showing in the end he still considered Flynn his friend and could not bring himself to kill him. CLU runs to obtain this disc from the obstacle stopping him from having the ultimate power, showing the rivalry between the Satan and savior of this world.Such themes like this show the filmmakers truly put a lot of thought into their creation, not a lack of it, so people need to stop discrediting them and their work.', 'This film is the best example of ""style over substance"", but wow, what substance. It has some of the best production design and soundtrack I have ever witnessed. Visually and aurally speaking, I would even call it a masterpiece. It is like no other techno-futuristic cyberspace I have ever seen depicted. However, it is let down by a dull main actor and an unpolished story that didn\'t fully convince me.', 'Everything about this film works. The visuals, writing, acting, everything. There are very few wrong things I can find with Tron, especially the soundtrack which is timeless even almost a decade later. I still remember watching this film in theaters and not regretting it at all. I highly recommend this film for fans of anything quality.From the pacing to the cinematography this film is astoundingly well made, and truly deserves more recognition. It is timeless in every meaning of the word.', 'TRON: Legacy is a literal misunderstood masterpiece & is one of the most intellectual, deepest science-fiction movies I\'ve seen Disney produce - EVER! Let me explain:\nImmediately, CLU has strong, deliberate similarities with Hitler - they both wanted to create ""the perfect system"" & viewed those in their society who were similar to themselves as superior, where individuals are only deemed valuable if they can be used to further implement & reassert the oppressive structures in place.In TRON, any program deemed useless or unfit for work is sent into ""the games"", where they\'re to be slaughtered for the amusement of less ""disposable"" citizens - disabled / programs unable to be ""rectified"" are lesser & have no place in this system CLU has created. It\'s as if those who cannot contribute, may rebel or show resistance cannot be allowed to exist & so only the obedient, functioning rectified ones remain.This is a symbolic representation of a fascist regime where those ruled under it are controlled by fear & intimidation - ""rectified"" programs are representative depictions of people who are brainwashed by a system & further explains why those who can\'t be are sent to their deaths. Any imperfection is prohibited & made an example of - uniformity is essential & total, unquestioning loyalty to the cause is expected. Again, noticeable connotations are made in order to reflect Nazi Germany";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Intimidated by his arrest record, his cameo-appearance superior officers (Martin Freeman, Steven Coogan, and Bill Nighy) transfer him from the busy streets of London to the sleepy village of Sandford to keep him out of the way and balance the books, because, to be honest, he\'s making the rest of them look bad. A big cop in a small town, Angel sees murders and conspiracies where the cameo cast of cops and locals see accidents, but, with the help of his partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), it\'s not long before he discovers that not everything in Sandford is quite what it seems.Sound clichéd? Good. That\'s the point. Once settled in Sandford, Hot Fuzz becomes a vehicle designed to send up every action film that has ever taken itself even slightly seriously from Police Story to Point Break, and it does this brilliantly by simply taking everything from these films and pushing them that bit further, making them appear both ridiculous and awesome at the same time. The characters are massively exaggerated (especially Pegg\'s super-cop and Timothy Dalton\'s fantastically over-the-top super-villain). The action sequences are outrageous, exciting, and feature a surprising degree of rough justice, perhaps most notably in the form of an old woman getting karate-kicked in the face (or maybe a pub landlord getting his head bear-trapped\x85). The dialogue ranges from obvious parody (""Did you tell him to cool off?"") to clever Pegg-Frost exchanges, and even the music is perfectly balanced between action-scene rock songs and mock-epic slow guitar pieces.However, that\'s not to say that Hot Fuzz is non-stop comic action. The first half an hour or so seems a little slow, but there\'s no reason to worry";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

No, I'm not referring to Michael Bay. I have no issues with him. He was nothing but a co-producer. What I can't take is how lovers of this movie can't see what was wrong with it. I'm a long time turtles fan. Born in the 80s, grew up on the TV show, seen all movies and series, and had many action-figures. This movie was disappointing. I'm not saying it's terrible and normally I don't really agree with critics, but this time, I'm inclined to. It simply wasn't that great. Here are the reasons why: 1 - This is the biggest mistake of the movie of which I still can't understand how they didn't realize it. The back-story/history between Yamato Yoshi and Shredder. There was no mention of Yoshi. Splinter was nothing but a NYC rat, experimented on with the 4 turtles. They escaped a fire and found themselves in the sewer. Why does Splinter have a Japanese style moustache and know everything about the shredder? Sacks mentioned a bit about Shredders rival clan back in Japan never went into details nor gave any indication that the rat was there or would've known anything about it. This rivalry is one of the main plot points in the history of TMNT and they took it out.2 - The Ninja turtles are the main characters in TMNT, not Megan Fox. She had way more face time than any of the turtles. I can't even think if Leo of Donnie had more than 10 lines.3 - Yes 3D is neat, but it's been years since we've developed it. Watching the massive overuse of close-ups and slow motion 3D was almost as painful as the slow motion action scenes in the last resident evil movies. I read one critic review mention around 800 close-up shots of Megan fox's lips. He could be right.4 - The plot was completely generic and unoriginal. Evil man wants to release Bio chemical weapon so he can be the hero by selling the cure, making billions of dollars. Yeah, that's never been done before.5 - Mutagen is the cure for everything? Let's pretend I buy that. Why does Donnie require eye glasses? Along with Donnie's glasses, a list of other things that made little sense. Splinter teaching himself Ninjutsu from some dirty book he finds in the sewer, somehow becomes some ninja master capable of fighting the Shredder, because remember, he's not Yamato Yoshi like he's supposed to be, nor did he have him train him as a pet rat, like the old 1990 movie did. The amount of times Shredder threatens to kill them, the amount of chances he had, yet he does not. Shooting blades from his X-men style silver samurai armour(that fly back and reattach by the way) while fighting splinter. Then just punch-stabs him once and tosses him down. Later fighting Raf, threatening to kill him. Just cracks his shell and walks away. The ridiculous fight scene, consisting of a semi being drive down an extremely steep, snowy mountain side. Not once coming close to losing its balance or crashing. With the turtles sliding down the mountain on their shells, keeping up with the speeding vehicles and staying ahead of the avalanche they cause. April trying to convince her boss of these human-sized ninja turtle teenagers. She actually has a decent photograph but doesn't show her and gets fired. Tracking Aprils GPS deep into the sewer. Normally many cell phones lose service just by being in a basement, let alone 50 feet below the surface. Wireless signals don't go through solid objects so well, especially the ground and dozens of feet of concrete. The ninja turtles are invincible now too. Bullets don't even penetrate.6 - The sexual objectification of Megan Fox. The many close ups, although nice to some, not really ideal for a PG13 audience.7 - The time-line. The movie was rushed, short intro, abrupt ending, with the simple and generic plot.8 - Choice of actors. Arnett was the best choice for his role compared to others. He gave the little bit of comic-relief that was believable of an April O'Neil camera man. The turtles voices were okay, although I don't know how they came up with Knoxville as Leo. Megan Fox, I gave the benefit of the doubt, but didn't seem like an April to me. I found out that Anna Kendrick and Jane Levy had tried out for the role. Either one would've been a better choice.9 - My last point is Hollywood in general. They seem more concerned about finding ways to maximize profit as opposed actually making really decent or epic movies. It just seems like they chose to do TMNT knowing how popular it already was anyways, then not really care how good of a job they did. In the end, it will likely make half a billion over a year anyways. Many movies lately are nothing but big names, product placement, and the mention of famous producers/directors. My dislike of this movie had nothing to do with BAY as the lovers of the movie seem to think. There's 5 other producers and 4 executive producers. People should realize that someone can like/ dislike movies for simply being what they are and have nothing to do with who's in it or who made it. I gave a 6 because it's still slightly entertaining but I couldn't bring myself to giving it a 7. That would require at least a good solid movie with nowhere near as many mistakes."", ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles isn't all that bad. This movie does a lot of good, good origin story, good acting, and fun scenes. This movie does have it's fair share of bad elements. 1. Splinter's teaching. Splinter is a good guy proved by the TV shows and comics, but in this movie he comes off as weird with his motives. He wants his sons to protect the city of New York by stopping crime, but prevents them from going to the surface, so how are they supposed to save the day. He also is weird in how he teaches his sons ninjutsu perfectly from a how to book. 2. The Shredder. This guy is the main Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles villain, who is scary for his actions and personality. In this movie however, the real Shredder is seen like twice and never again, unless in his armor. The only thing that is scary about him is his armor, and this shouldn't be the case. This movie gets a Worst movie ever for the fact being Splinter forbids his sons going up top, bur yet he can get Domino's pizza in the sewer."", 'Seriously, Michael Bay & Co. should pay me for sitting through this ridiculous pile of tripe.Grew up with the comics and cartoon show, loved the 1990 movie. Every sense I possess was repeatedly violated with this poor excuse of a greedy cash grab and pizza hut endorsement.I knew not to expect, well, anything really that has Michael Bay\'s name attached to it, but somehow still managed to be surprised at the sheer badness.The turtles themselves look strange, and act strange. Michaleangelo is like some weird semi-gangsta who is downright creepy in a continuing reference obsession with April O\'Neil. Raphael is aloof, but exists little beyond that. That\'s as far as they went trying to define either one of them. Leonardo, the brave leader, was completely robbed of his personality, characteristics, leadership and anything that would define him, and has always in the past. He is instead a dissolved Bouillon cube in a large pot of water....bland, bland, bland. His voice (Johnny Knoxville) is miscast, and would\'ve been better befitting either Mikey or Raph...that is if they\'d bothered to give them any personality.The biggest violations however, lay with Donatello and Splinter, as it seems they thought that hyper-charging the characters would somehow make them interesting, endearing or watchable. ""Donatello does machines"" translates into exploiting him as a constant, textbook, super nerd. And he does absolutely nothing beyond that. Also, he looks like a Ghostbuster. Say hi to Dr. Donatello Stantz. Instead of making Splinter the wise, insightful, deep, sensei he always has been, he\'s instead to a cardboard cutout that does a lot of ""action stuff"". Don\'t get me wrong, the Splinter of the cartoon and comics could certainly hold his own, but violence was always the last resort, and had a rationale. (reminds me of what they did to Yoda in the Star Wars prequels.) And he learns Ninjitsu from a book in the sewer, gone is any mysticism or any pivotal, emotional, or vital connection to important characters in the story.Shredder is lame. There\'s no other way to put it. He is also a hyper charged extension ""more blades piled on the suit will make him better!"" He is unrecognizable beyond the pile of CGI blades, has no depth, no real motivation, and feels needlessly shoe horned into the ""story"" Especially since they terminated any connection with Splinter, or the long important history between them. (by the way, welcome to ""plot convenience playhouse"" when you find out that the turtles and Splinter were pets of April\'s when she was a girl. How convenient. The biggest human violation is no doubt Megan Fox, who continues to show she\'s a vapid, terrible actress, incapable of emotion, facial expressions, or the ability to close her mouth. She\'s absolutely terrible and is no April O\'Neil. Michael Bay continues to have an obsession with Megan Fox like you would not believe. She also has no class, instead of choosing to take criticism constructively and look to improving herself and growing into a mature, capable lady, she instead publicly insults any who bashes this movie";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The two big criticisms I see people making about it are that the Mandarin wasn't the same as in the comics, and that Tony didn't use the armor much. I consider the Mandarin to be a boring villain in the first place. The comedy was worth not having an iconic super villain. As far as not using the armor enough, I did want to see more of Iron Man tearing stuff apart. But again, I liked what we got in place of it so much, it was an agreeable trade off. Seeing how resourceful Tony can be with none of his technology was just as fun, and the stuff with the kid was full of great humor. Guy Pearce's sleazy bad guy in a suit wasn't nearly as much fun as Justin Hammer from #2--I would have rather had him back. The after-credits scene legitimately had me worried--I want to imagine Tony and Banner are hanging out. I don't like the idea that they might not be getting along! Even all the other problems people point out about plot holes and character inconsistencies don't really diminish how much I enjoyed IM3. I thought the script was incredible and I was constantly surprised at how inventive it was. RD jr. created a character for the ages with his take on Tony, but with this installment, I now feel this character and this movie series may be among my personal favorites. This movie is just too smart to be a big summer action kids movie, but it had its cake and ate it too: well made and impossibly successful. Good for them. I want more.2019 Update: Oh well.."", 'Not in the case of Iron man III in the Iron man trilogy.', 'Iron Man 3 (2013) is A Marvel pure, fun, popcorn, Action Film and the third entry of the Iron Man trilogy. It is an awesome superhero Action flick a huge improvement over Iron Man 2 (2010) and million ways better than the new Marvel comic book film Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)!!!!!!!! This film is very criticized and bashed from it is fans. I admit it the first time I watched this film, I hated it, with the Mandarian joke the twist and Guy Pearce been the bad guy and so on. But now after I watch it I was highly impressed and Entertained, this film wasn\'t boring it had less humor in it and was the most serious with action scenes. Shure there is less Iron Man and more Tony in it, but doesn\'t ruined my loving for Iron man trilogy! The most what I love of this film is. There wasn\'t any Avengers in it trough the whole film. Only Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk made a cameo scene on the end of the credits but that was it and it did not bother me or annoyed. The story centers around Tony Stark not Avengers, that is why I just love this movie! Thank god Jon Favreau step down as the Director and Shane Black replaced him! I was surprised by the fact that Disney allowed Shane Black making an Action film flick in Lethal Weapon and Die Hard With a Vengeance style! Yes Action style!I am defending this film against haters. I know a lot of people who will see my review will put it down, just like 30 people put down my review Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)! First off this film isn\'t Die Hard With A Vengeance or Lethal Weapon film even tough Tony and Rhodes are fighting with guns without their armors. I love the film because it is serious it has Action. Gwyneth Paltrow did a wonderful performance as Pepper un like she did in Iron Man 2. And yes fans I am saying it. She was so damn annoying in Iron Man 2, I disliked watching her in that movie, in this film she is a supporting and caring girlfriend unlike Iron Man 2.I love this film because The film sets place after the events of The Avengers on Christmas Eve!!! Tony Stark (the always wonderfully charismatic Robert Downey Jr.) is falling apart. This is the first time I see Tony Stark and Iron Man in a snow in Christmas, This film reminds me on Batman Returns (1992) Tim Burton\'s film. It is pretty good. The attack on Tony\'s house whit helicopters blowing Tony\'s house to pieces was the first time in the film I ever saw. Gwyneth put Iron Man Armor on in and she saved Maya Hansen that was outstanding. The scene was pure action! There was kid in this film and no he wasn\'t annoying, he did a good job helping Tony Stark against his post traumatic stress disorder attacks. Not annoying kid and I think he did a good job. Tony Stark was brilliant fixing and building a new armored suits. Iron Man saved 13. passengers from falling off the airplane Air Force One, tough he crashed in the truck, I loved that scene. Aldrich Killian participated in the development of Extremis thereby amassing a group of Extremis-enhanced soldiers under his command. Killian played by an awesome Guy Pierce did a wonderful job portraying a villain to Tony Stark. I really think Guy Pierce just did an amazing job portraying a villain in Iron Man 3 he was some A.I.M. soldier creating a terrorist attacks and he was brilliant to make an alias Mandarin! To mask his illegal activities as terrorist attacks he created the idealized terrorist persona known as the ""Mandarin""! that was brilliant and I love the twist!Tony Stark, is proved in this third and more than likely final chapter in the solo run of Iron Man. Iron Man 3 or Three as it appears in the end credits amps up the action and closes out the trilogy on a high note setting Tony\'s eventual return in summer 2015\'s Avengers: Age of Ultron. But in his most darkest moments he is challenged by his emotions of what happened to him in New York, while dealing with the biggest threat he has encountered: Mandarin. Without given any plot points away for those who may have not seen this, but Iron Man 3 is well worth the admission and then some. People Iron Man 3 sets up Marvel\'s Phase 2 of features.This is the best Iron Man movie yet, better than Iron Man 2 and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) Loved the storyline and Tony was a genius and brilliant again as usual. Great special effects. A very busy, action- and humour-packed comic-book flick. Better than Iron Man 2, but not nearly as good as the original. As usual, Ben Kingsley (as Trevor Slattery) rocked, as did even-sexier-when-angry Gwyneth Paltrow. :-D The acting. Robert Downey is as good as ever, Paltrow, Pearce, Cheadle & Co follow not far behind. The best is Ben Kingsley, though, although his character is ... no, I just want to mention the Good here.Iron Man 3 (stylized on screen as Iron Man Three) is a 2013 superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.When Tony Stark\'s world is torn apart by a formidable terrorist called the Mandarin, he starts an odyssey of rebuilding and retribution.The rating I am giving to this movie is 9/10', ""This movie has lots of special effects and lots of noise and lots of excellent actors, but it forgot to include one thing: a story. Well, actually, there is a story, of sorts, but it is so superficial as to render it moot. This movie is proof that special effects alone do not make for a good movie, or for even a fair movie. When Miss Penny has to bail out Iron Man, that's a sure sign that the script department is desperate. But that aside, the story is so shallow and the bad guys so predictable that the movie loses dramatic power, rendering it stale. Of course, this can happen when a comic book story is transposed onto the screen. If not portrayed correctly, the story will not be taken seriously, and the movie tanks. Iron Man 1 and 2 managed to avoid that problem";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But after watching uri and other really good armed forces movie , man this movie just average . Acting was good and photography was good to but not that much on story .little sloppy on screenplay . Except for the first song rest of them were really misplaced . Even if they removed the songs wouldn't bad. Hrithik was good and did hold up his own , but might not be right role for him. Rest of cast did good and were apt . Villan was good looking but man had a single line dialogue. Should have more . One time watch that too if you hardcore fan of Hrithik ."", 'Fighter helmed by Sidharth Anand and featuring a stellar cast including Hrithik Roshan, Deepika Padukone, and Anil Kapoor, unfortunately, falls into a myriad of pitfalls that collectively diminish the film\'s overall impact. The most glaring issue is the excessive use of slow-motion shots, which not only overwhelms the viewer but also detracts from the storytelling. The repetitive nature of these sequences becomes a veritable headache, diluting the potential impact of pivotal moments.While the star power of the cast is undeniable, the film\'s visual effects leave much to be desired. The CGI elements lack the finesse expected in contemporary cinema, diminishing the overall cinematic experience. Furthermore, the inclusion of songs seems more like a gratuitous platform for Deepika Padukone\'s dance performances rather than serving a purpose within the narrative, contributing to a disjointed viewing experience.The inclusion of songs in the movie felt forced and unnecessary. While music can undoubtedly elevate a film, in ""Fighter,"" it appeared more like a platform for Deepika Padukone to showcase her dance skills than an integral part of the storytelling. This diversion from the plot not only disrupted the flow but also left me questioning the purpose of these musical interludes.A notable drawback is the film\'s length, and this issue could have been mitigated by a judicious removal of the superfluous slow-motion shots. Trimming the runtime would not only enhance the pacing but also potentially salvage the film\'s narrative cohesion.The dog-fight scenes, crucial in a film of this genre, disappoint with their lackluster execution. The fighter plane\'s appearance verges on the cartoonish, compromising the realism necessary for such intense sequences. This, unfortunately, positions ""Fighter"" as a pale imitation rather than a worthy contender in the action-thriller genre.**Military Maneuvers by Hollywood, Not the IAF:** The movie throws around military ranks and procedures like confetti at a party. Group leaders can\'t just transfer squadron leaders, and ""borrowing"" a fighter jet is pure fantasy. Come on, guys, some basic research goes a long way.**Action Sequences That Defied Physics:** The action scenes were more like action *comedy*. Pilots teleporting after ejection and mid-air fistfights? I get it, Hollywood loves explosions, but some semblance of realism would have been nice. This wasn\'t ""Top Gun,"" it was ""Top goof.""**Radio Silence...Except It Wasn\'t?:** They tried to create tension with a jamming scene, but any real pilot knows fighter jets have ways to counter that. It felt like the writers forgot about basic military tech in their quest for drama.**War Crimes for Entertainment? No Thanks:** Adding insult to injury, the movie depicts a war crime that was just plain insensitive. Using such a serious topic as a plot point was a massive low blow.**Showcasing Indian Power...Except They Didn\'t? ** India has some impressive military tech, like the BrahMos missile. This movie could have been a chance to showcase that, but instead, it was a complete no-show. Talk about a missed opportunity!**Overall, ""Fighter"" felt like a flashy brochure for fighter jets written by someone who wouldn\'t know a wingman from a wing nut.** It wasn\'t entertaining, and it wasn\'t even a good kind of unrealistic. If you\'re looking for a movie that respects the Indian Air Force and delivers thrilling aerial combat, this one\'s a total dud. Stick to documentaries, people.Comparisons with Ajay Devgn\'s ""Runway 34"" further amplify the film\'s shortcomings. Despite a potentially smaller budget, ""Runway 34"" managed to deliver a more engaging and commendable cinematic experience. The discrepancy raises questions about the directorial choices made in ""Fighter,"" leaving audiences longing for a more polished and well-thought-out production.In conclusion, ""Fighter"" struggles to soar to the heights anticipated from a film of this caliber. Sidharth Anand\'s vision, marred by a lack of restraint in certain aspects, results in a movie that feels like a missed opportunity rather than the cinematic triumph it could have been.', ""Yes it's a bit flawed, yes it has few plot holes but, in current crop of movies it's nice change of pace. Like I said it's not a Movie it's an Emotion which simply showcases the fact that if we come to ourselves we can conquer the world.The action the direction the look and feel of Dog Fights, the gears used by the pilots has realism to it. Yes the love angle may rub few in wrong way but, it's kept very short so I didn't mind it.The star cast and Team has gone above and beyond to make this special. In my honest opinion we should least give it a chance as it's shining light on workings of Indian Air force."", 'The movie has some very good scenes that would make an Indian proud, but the expected Bollywood tadka makes it an average movie.The ending was pointless, with multiple fighter planes destroyed and totally ignoring the fact that to save one pilot multiple pilots landed in POK after their planes were destroyed.To add salt to the injury, the dramatic entry of Patty, out of no where, to save Sukkhi is a joke.I wish they could have added more realism to the movie. It was a movie with the right star cast and good plot, but the execution made it an average movie.Many scenes were copied from Top Gun Maverick.', ""Fighter is an ambitious aerial action film that attempts to showcase the heroism and skill of the Indian Air Force. The film stars Hrithik Roshan as Patty, a daring squadron leader who leads a team of elite pilots called Air Dragons. Deepika Padukone plays Mini, his love interest and fellow pilot. Anil Kapoor plays Rocky, a veteran group captain who mentors team.The film is directed by Siddharth Anand, who previously made War (2019), another action blockbuster starring Hrithik Roshan. Fighter is the first film in a planned franchise that aims to create a cinematic universe of aerial warfare. The film has both positive and negatives.First of all the positives, The film has stunning visuals, especially the air to air combat scenes, which are adrenaline-rushing and realistic. The film boasts of great production value and the scale is justified by the topography of the snow-clad mountains of Kashmir and surrounding areas.The film has impressive performances by the lead actors, especially Hrithik Roshan, who portrays Patty with charisma and intensity. Deepika Padukone and Anil Kapoor also deliver convincing performances as Mini and Rocky, respectively. The film also has a strong supporting cast, including Karan Singh Grover, Akshay Oberoi, Sanjeeda Sheikh, and Ashutosh Rana.The film has a catchy soundtrack composed by Vishal-Shekhar, featuring total of 5 songs. Hrithik as usual brings finesse to his dancing abilities and a whopping eye candy for his physique. Deepika also looks stunning in all the songs.With its highs, the film also brings lot of lows .The film has a preachy and melodramatic tone, which hampers the entertainment value and realism of the film. The film tries to convey a message of nationalism and unity, but ends up being jingoistic and overly biased. The film also has some unnecessary and cheesy dialogues which may make your eyes roll.The film has a long and dragging runtime, which tests the patience and interest of the audience. The film could have been edited and trimmed to make it more crisp and engaging. The film also has some irrelevant and boring subplots, such as Patty's estranged relationship with his father, Rocky's rivalry with patty, and Mini's career aspirations.In conclusion, Fighter is a film that has some potential and merit, but fails to live up to the expectations and hype. The film is a mixed bag of high positives and very low negatives, which might appeal to some fans of the genre and the actors, but might disappoint others who are looking for a more original and realistic film like Topgun. Fighter is a film that tries to soar high, but falls short of its mark. Fighter is a film that sure to bring numbers to the box office and thrill cinema goers alike but soon to be forgotten in a month or so."", 'A very shallow script, aimed at stoking nationalistic feelings of the public. The movie follows the real events of 2019, but then nationalistic and narcissistic fantasy takes over: Cross border commando raid, shooting down of Pakistan Air Force aircrafts, entering the Pakistan airspace at will and the captured IAF pilot being murdered.The movie tries to create the aura of Top Gun: Rule breaking brilliant pilot, heavy bike, Tom Cruise jacket and Ray Bans, show off stunts, risk taking etc. But there was zero attempt to understand aerial combat. Consider this:\nEnemy pilots exchange threats and dialogues during a dogfight over radio, reminiscent of the 1980s jingoistic movie ""Border"" where rival tank commanders were issuing verbal threats eye to eye.The protagonist rams his fighter plane into his nemesis pilot\'s plane and ejects milliseconds earlier. The absurd idea seems to be ""borrowed"" from Rambo 3 where Rambo rams his Tank into the Russian enemy\'s helicopter. But destroying an F-16 by ramming your Su-30 into it? Laughable.The best fighter pilot is unable to take aim at the enemy\'s Anti Aircraft guns and needs the help of a friendly helicopter to find his line of sight, and in the process shoots down the helicopter! I\'m certain IAF fighter pilots and aviation pilots must be pulling their hair out at this absurdity.How difficult is it for the script writer to consult an air force pilot for aerial battle scenes? The same consultant would have also told the movie makers that the planning for a sensitive and dangerous cross border operation involving the air force and army commandos cannot be done by a junior ranked fighter pilot. It involves generals, air marshals and top intelligence agencies officials, to say the least.If you\'re going to make a military movie, at least get your basic facts right. Overall a very drab, shallow and boring movie. The only silver lining was some special effects in the air.', 'With 5 stars only our armed forces supported this idea & 1 star for Mr. Anil Kapoor who stood strong in his aggressive role as a CO.. direction team seriously lacking Homework of tactical warfare exercise with mixing domestic emotions & unnecessary hype of Heriosm yields no sense.Though output from HR is reasonably good, right extract of his ability to portray is still too long to bring, except getting an idea of IOP over POK, though looks pretty controversial and did not hit any concerns in social media, we have our real heros to keeping the control of situation going to the bottoms of it.Vishal Dadlani kept his quality promising with excellent background score, Especially bringing the real emotion from the Song Mitti. Excellent work.', ""Well, the story is obvious from the trailer- so don't complain. It's the same that we have seen multiple times in other Bollywood patriotic movies, Fighter has a few tweaks which make the second half interesting. Certainly it's not a remake but better if you have forgotten the Topguns! Promising VFX works, well shot action sequences and a few thoughtful dialogues managed to lift the film up in the air. The director flew this film well, as you know-action is his strength. The film would have crashed without great actors, their great performances and well choreographed songs.The question is how long would this film fly?"", 'An amazing entertainer, especially the aerial shots and the vfx came out unexpectedly great!! All of the action in the film was so well staged and choreographed . Hrithik Roshan is an exceptional actor and like all his other films, he delivers his best. He\'s not afraid of those close up shots, takes on the those intense close up shots like a champ and excels! Deepika Padukone was solid , delivers her part very well. Anil Kapoor shines. Special mention to the background music score too.Also somehting the film does so well compared to Sid Anand\'s previous films is that this one feels ""real"" in a weird way. Even though ""Patty"" is supposedly the best man India has, ""Red Nose"" was presented really well, giving patty a hard time too. Similarly the climatic action sequence where the whole team works together. Even little things like Patty hanging for his life on a chopper feels real, unlike Pathaans and tigers , causally one arm hanging off choppers.', ""Director Siddharth Anand has put in a lot of effort in making this movie. This movie has a lot of CGI elements and when compared to other Indian movies with heavy CGI this one is far better, and you can see that effort.Story wise I would say it was alright, I liked the first half of the movie which was inspired by the real terror attacks which happened back in 2019, but in the second half of the movie you will see extra spice added which felt a little too much to take.Hrithik Roshan doesn't disappoint when it comes to acting, and even some of the small elements such as saying please is done well."", ""Summary- Poor story...wrong intention and portray.Great acting by all actors.. but who are the script writers?! Excessively bad writing.. Indian audience does not need so much melodrama to watch a movie. So much of crying, martyrdom, funerals, useless tears and forced emotional scenes.Movies main intention to show the fight back capability which actually does not exist and showcase weaker Indian diplomacy. If it was a remake of the real incident this movie would have been a super hit. Waste of weekend time.

The mummy actress impressed me more than I expected, since I didn't really like her that much in Kingsman. People said that this spent too much time setting up the following movies, but I didn't think that was the case. There were small seeds planted, but save for the ending and lack of background for Jekyll, this felt self contained enough. Overall the movie had some fun action sequences and decent characters, and made for an enjoyable popcorn flick. I do not regret watching it."", 'It\'s never good when you have to say ""It\'s not that bad!"" but I think the Mummy is being treated to harshly by critics. It has a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes. Really? It\'s not a great movie, but it is fun to watch and I thought the ending was very good. It felt a bit like a B- Movie in the beginning, but I still enjoyed it. 7 out of 10', 'I\'m a fan of this ""type"" of movie, i.e. Indiana Jones, clean cut fun. I liked the \'99 Mummy version (Brendan Fraser & Rachel Wiesz) a lot, but this movie is not in the same vein. It is not meant to be campy, but it still light hearted.I like the stories arch, and how it was told. Though Sofia Boutella, Ahmanet, was actually quite good in her role. Maybe people we expecting a remake of the \'99 version, or maybe people didn\'t expect this from Cruise. Whatever the reason, count me as someone who wasn\'t disappointed.', ""I've never written a movie review before, but after seeing this one I just had to, I was so disappointed. I was a kid when the previous Mummy series came out, and those movies were infinitely more interesting/entertaining. Its a huge disappointment because this film falls apart for several reasons:Story- Cursed Egyptian princess is awoken after 5,000 years. Okay, awesome. Has all the same powers as previous incarnation, Imhotep (controlling sands, super strength, animating corpses, etc.). Okay, cool- could've been a little more creative/ original, but okay. You cast Sofia Boutella as the new Mummy- super awesome (I'd never even heard of her before this movie and now I'll probably go see everything else she's ever in).And then the best the writers come up with is that the endgame for such a powerful entity would be... to just summon a more powerful entity than her into existence? Way to drop the ball- someone should be fired for that hack job. The potential was there to make Ahmanet an infinitely interesting character ( Sofia Boutella's seductive charm alone has you routing for Ahmanet half the movie) but they reduce her to an eye-candy role, writing her to literally need Tom Cruise's body to do what she has set out to do (not even going to delve into that ridiculousness). At least when they wrote Imhotep in the previous incarnation, it made sense in that his motivations were his own power, not someone else's.And that's without even touching on the rushed backstory for Ahmanet, or the fact that there is really no development in the relationships between the characters nor the characters themselves.Action- Its like they somehow took all the iconic scenes from the previous incarnation and made them awful. The Mummy absorbing people's life force. The images when the mummy is controlling the sands. The chase/escape scenes. Not only were none of these concepts elaborated on, they somehow managed to make them less interesting this time around, too. If you don't believe me, go back and watch the 1999 version.Cast- This is probably the most egregious problem with this movie, and its very disappointing because it wasn't all bad. Russel Crowe as Dr. Jekyll? Brilliant. Absolutely awesome portrayal of the Jekyll/Hyde characters delivered masterfully. Previously mentioned Sofia Boutella as the Mummy? What a perfect choice for the role. Even Jake Johnson's Sgt. Vail would've been good if the writing had been better. But 54 year old Tom Cruise as the lead? Embarrassing. Say what you will about Brendan Fraser, but in 1999 he had hit his stride and was funny and charming. He was also in his 30's and much more believable as a treasure-hunting action star. There's no point in even talking about the casting choice of Annabelle Wallis, because her presence might as well have been non-existent after the scene where she slaps Tom Cruise in the face (you know, right at the beginning). The writing didn't make it believable that she is an archaeologist, and the performance isn't memorable in the slightest. Especially if we're comparing that to 1999 Rachel Weisz's Evie who was a dream-babe.And even without the comparisons, if the two most interesting/compelling characters in your hero-saves-world action movie are A) a character who had all of 10-15 minutes of screen time, and B) the main antagonist, then you did something way wrong.All in all this was a sad attempt to reboot an awesome story which had great potential- a solid frame of reference in the previous incarnation, a darker, more dramatic/less goofy tone, and almost 2 decades in updates to CGI/special effects which could have made for much more compelling supernatural/action scenes- but it was squandered with terrible writing and awful casting which lead to hollow performances."", ""This movie is a classic case of design-by-committee ruining a production. What makes it special is... you get the feeling that everyone understood this. They didn't even try to make a serious product. This movie makes choices that are so bafflingly silly there's no way the people signing off on them didn't know. They didn't care, and this lack of seriousness opens up the space for some decently fun moments. This is a bad movie of the enjoyable kind."", 'Disappointing. A few good visuals, but hardly any story. The plot: an ancient mummy gets a new lease of life. The actress playing the mummy is quite good but Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe are awful. They play themselves and most of the time seem half-hearted and bored,just going through the motions to get a pay check. Lucky my vote is a generous: 3/10.', 'Disappointed...no real story line, predictable events, and choice of a particular character line was lame... Lots of holes in the story... Story jumped all over without real connections to plot... Characters lacked depth... Would have liked to have seen more actual references to Ancient Egypt that would have made the story line more believable. Not a movie I would see again...', '""Dead is just the beginning"", right? In this case it might be the beginning of the end of the world of gods and monsters. I have been dwelling on how to review this movie as I want to be fair but I don\'t want to mislead you.I will start by saying that Sofia Boutella nails the character of Princess Ahmunet, she is truly a goddess with of course an ancient course that she brought upon herself, but her character is so likable you actually end up rooting for the ultimate evil, Boutella brings a charisma to the mummy that it is hard to match.My biggest fear going in was Russell Crowe as doctor Henry Jekyll and his other persona, Mr Edward Hyde, but the actor gives the performance of his lifetime as both characters and his seedy organization, which is truly as evil and ruthless as the ""monsters"" they chase. And this is how I like my ""heroes"", men or groups that for the common ""good"" are willing to become monsters themselves, it makes for an interesting plot.Here\'s where things go sideways: Tom Cruise, yes I said it. Nick Morton is an amalgamation of Rick O\'Connell of the Brendan Fraiser movies and Ethan Hawk from M:I. His character lacks charisma and his romance with Jenny (Annabelle Wallis) is less than believable. It borders in a cheap Fabio novel paper back, the movie would have been much better without Tom Cruise and Nick Morton.Here\'s where things go bad: The special effects, last year I hammered Ghostbusters for their ""Scooby-like"" CGI and it pains me as I have to do the same here, the CGI was awful, seriously! When a TV Show like Game of Thrones can have great FX there is absolutely no excuse to have a big franchise movie, the start of one had FX so incredibly awful, they looked like a freaking cartoon. That seriously killed the movie.There are a couple of good scenes but I have to say sadly that the Dark Universe is dead, or at least it should be.My rating is 6 out of 10, and I\'m being nice.Welcome to a new world of meh...', ""Badly written, with characters you don't give a hoot about, this was a colossal waste of money. No humor, no characters to really root for, I can't believe I just wasted the last 2 hours of my evening watching such a stupid movie.Who greenlit this monstrosity? He should be fired."", 'I liked the movie and seriously feel that this movie doesn\'t deserve all the hate it is getting. The movie felt more like a start to a series of movies. It was not at all as bad as the critics and reviewers rated it to. What do you expect? An exact remake of the ""The Mummy""? Come on... Go watch and enjoy a decent story, great actors and action. I seriously hope they make a sequel, I would definitely watch it.', 'Heading out of the theater I was dissapointed to say the least....Of course Tom Cruise killed it as an actor in this film.\nBut the story is Boring, it doesn\'t have the same feel as the 1999 and 2001 one and it has a pretty dull ending.\nAlot of people may enjoy it and I get that but for me it was just a ""Whatever"" movie.\nIf you want a good movie which entertains you I recommend staying away from this and choosing another Movie.\nOverall pretty poor start to Universals ""Dark Universe"".', 'No Brendon Fraiser, no stars. Enough with the remakes already. Remakes Remakes are not well made these days.Gohstbusters, Fantastic Four, Total Recall, shoot now they are even thinking about remaking Flatliners and Overboard. These were great movies that did not need to be remade and degraded. Please have an original thought Hollywood, is it too much to ask for? Anyway. It was a forgettable film that should be lost in the dust.', 'I can\'t hate this film, even if it seems like that\'s what\'s going to be trending. As a Dark Universe movie, it obviously follows the footprints of the comic book movie universes, while utilizing old Universal/Hammer horror movie elements.I believe most of the naysayers expected a new horror movie anthology, one that brings the same fright that the old ones did we used to watch as kids. Honestly, Universal horror movies can\'t be that sort of frightening anymore,since we are not the same people anymore either. Universal was never about jumpscares or deep psychological horror like the current trending ""horror"" themes. It was about slowly creeping fear caused by fictional monsters.In my opinion, Dark Universe films are and will be meant to be watched as action films infused with classic horror elements and characters instead of the other way around. And to me, those few elements did hit the spot.My favorite bits horror-wise are the mummy herself immediately after resurrection: that shambling, crawling undead figure with dislocated joints and broken bones was exactly like something you wouldn\'t want to see heading your way in a dark London alley.I also liked Cruise being chased by the undead Crusaders under water. The relatively slow movement all while being underwater, half-drowning, really is a nightmarish situation even if it is not meant to make you jump out of your seat (which I still find to be the cheapest sort of thrill, therefore a bad idea).The makers deciding not to use CGI in an exhibitionist way was another one of these good bits: in many scenes, the overall darkness leaves just enough for our imagination to fill in with scary ideas instead of showing off so much, we start noticing how sterile and unfrightening CGI looks in general (I\'m looking at you, Alien: Covenant).As for being an action flick, yes, it definitely wasn\'t a John Wick or a Rogue One. Not terrible, not great either, and had a little problem with unnecessary action sequences. The fight between the characters of Cruise and Crowe was lacking any motivation other than showing off. Improve it in the following movies, please (which I do hope to come).How could it be better? More detailed characters: okay, we know, the girl is cute, Tom Cruise is bringing the Tom Cruise we know from most of his movies since the 80s and Crowe is Jekyll/Hyde, but who are they as characters in this very universe? If you\'re building a universe, you need strong, memorable characters to build it upon, glory of the past and eye candy is simply not enough.More inventive action scenes. Watching Dracula and the Ottoman army duke it out from the reflection of a wobbling sword in Dracula Untold was a good one. More like that, less ""Tom Cruise gets the umpteenth pimp smack the very same way from an obviously stronger enemy"".Giving some power to the Good, if Evil has so much would spice things up. Jekyll\'s self-sustained evil is nice, but why stop there? Let\'s make it really interesting. What if the reanimation of the dead Crusaders backfired and they tried to fight Ahmanet due to their once holy life? They were trying to guard that gem after all, keeping their oath in their death would have been a nice addition. I understand that the franchise is more about monsters than heroes, but reducing the possibilities of what *could* happen in a still forming universe is unnecessary and even harmful.These three points are the three missing stars from my rating (based on the axiom of this movie is meant to be an action movie). The Mummy is by no means a bad film, but whatever you may expect it to be, you will find it at least a little disappointing for one reason or the other.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"['This movie reflects and deals with the theme of racism, facism and slavery a lot more than the other films. It displays big ideas and is very interesting, it\'s hindered by it\'s budget unfortunately.The son of Zira and Cornelius is the main character and he works through the troubling human society, which has begun to enslave the apes for ""lower class"" work.They had a tight budget and did the best they could. Roddy Mcdowall is excellent as always, and the set they used was interesting, and the human costumes are very militaristic and that looked good.I like this movie, their ideas were bigger than their budget, but they did a damn fine job.', ""The film's battle scenes were deliberate imitations of the Watts Riots. Black and Latino audiences cheered the hardest. Some white racists found the film deeply frightening.Sammy Davis Jr called the film series the best films that were ever made about racism. This film might be the most successful and powerful slave revolt ever shown on film."", 'In a futuristic world that has embraced ape slavery, Caesar, the son of the late simians Cornelius and Zira, surfaces after almost twenty years of hiding out from the authorities, and prepares for a slave revolt against humanity.Screenwriter Paul Dehn wrote the film incorporating references to the racial conflicts in North America during the early 1970s. This is evident, as the theme is about apes becoming servants and slaves. Now, it is not really explained how the chimpanzees go from being normal chimps to the more humanoid apes we see in this film. But I guess we are supposed to just pretend these are all real chimps.The message is a bit strong, but maybe made more sense at the time. Today it seems like they tried too hard and it almost seems silly.', ""This movie was okay but severely marred by unbelievable human behavior and concepts.   Rating 4/10As a science fiction fan, I can easily suspend disbelief about various scientific concepts (ie: intelligently evolved apes travel back in time and conceive a child(chimp), force-field doors, etc...)  However, when various common sense concepts and human behavior are flawed it usually ruins the movie for me.  Just a 'few' examples from this film:*spoilers** Concept: How did apes change so drastically in such a short period of time, to become bigger and more intelligent in a mere 20 years?  This is not even alluded to in any way.  Had they made reference to or alluded to Bio-engineering, or the virus having killed all cats and dogs causing this, perhaps I would have found it acceptable, however they did not explain this even in the slightest.   Mere selective breeding would not permit such rapid change in 20 years.  Since we already have some understanding of evolution, such rapid development should have been explained (if only in a single sentence).   Note: since we have no understanding of backward time-travel, it does not need to be explained.* Human Behavior:  Why, knowing what Corneilus and Zira told them about the future, would mankind and human government permit the keeping of apes as pets and eventual slaves, while increasing their intelligence and capabilities?    I could see if this happened a hundred or more years down the road, but 20 years after the intelligent apes arrive from the future and tell how apes rule the planet and subjagate humans, mankind is purposely making apes more intelligent and capable.  It's absurd.* Concept/Behavior: With such an oppressive and militaristic 1984'esque government, how are they so easily overrun by apes, which seem to have their every move watched except for their collection of an arsenal of weapons. In a similar vein, how is it that such a society has a system in which apes take simple notes of paper to businesses to retrieve things for their owners (including a firearm and amunition?)A science fiction film does not need to explain every single concept, but for those things which are not explained they need to make some degree of sense to our understanding of the way things work and human beings behave."", 'You watch this movie, with its depiction of humans (with a single exception) as either mindless order-following automata or mustache-twirling stock villains, and you have to ask yourself: Is this what the filmmakers think people are like? Well, no, of course not. This is what the filmmakers think *other* people are like.And that, far more than decreasing budgets or continuity errors, explains the inferiority of the APES sequels to the original.Great satire--indeed, great art--is always an examination of *us*, of what *we* are like. This is what the original film did so well and why it is still remembered so fondly. By this point in the series, however, the filmmakers were simply sneering at ""them,"" defined as all those people who didn\'t attend film school or vote for McGovern. It\'s a nasty, bigoted little piece of hackwork which tries to pass itself off as clever satire.', 'Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes is actually a good movie.  One could argue that it\'s a case of good writing in the face of a pathetically low budget, ala Star Trek.  The ""future city"" in the film was actually a then-new business complex in L.A., on the verge of completion.  The producers lucked out and got permission to shoot there.  This was good, because the studio had alloted said producers a ridiculously low budget, something like 1.7 million dollars, to make the movie.  The tiny budget especially shows through in the special effects and the props: check out the ""authenticator"", used to make Ricardo Montalban\'s character tell the truth to the goverment heavies, which looks like a dining room hanging lamp with a blue bulb inside.  Money problems aside, Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes is still entertaining, and makes some pointed observations about real-life society in the process.  Just overlook the only-in-\'72 turtlenecks, afros and push-button phones with the cords removed.  :-).', 'Thin story but lots of action, though the relentless fighting gets a bit monotonous.Good performances from Roddy McDowall, Hari Rhodes and Ricardo Montalban. Fun to see nice guy Don Murray play a devious villain.Like all ape films there is the pithy social commentary, but it is a bit heavy handed and obvious. The most sympathetic human is a black guy (get it?)The thing with the ape sequels is that they all made statements on society, but all those ideas were present in the original film anyway. All the satire of the sequels was really just a reworking of things we have seen before.', ""Roddy McDowall's back in action here in a very interesting concept for a film, being set in an alternate reality where apes have evolved into basically mute people with only Caesar being able to speak. The apes are treated like slaves and eventually Caesar has to rise them up to fight their masters in a bloody battle for liberty, it's very interesting and Roddy McDowall is great fun to watch.6/10: Good standard film, with nasty villains and some terrific fight scenes"", 'While watching the original Apes film for the first time, one of the thoughts I remember having was ""wouldn\'t it be cool to see exactly HOW the apes revolted against the humans?"". Well, ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" gives us exactly that.For a basic plot summary, ""Conquest"" continues the story of the offspring of Cornelius and Zira, sheltered on Earth by circus owner Armando (Ricardo Montalbon). Now branded as Ceasar (Roddy McDowell), the advanced-intelligence chimpanzee bristles at the slave-like treatment of apes in the ""future"" (1991), eventually leading the revolt that will change the world.The key ""drawing card"" of this movie is the last half hour, when we actually get to see the apes revolt against their human masters. Worth the price of admission alone is the epic speech given by Ceasar as he leads the apes in their conquest. After all the ape history talked about in the previous three movies, it is exhilarating to actually SEE it transpiring.""Conquest"" is also strange, though, in that it is unfortunate that it had to come after ""Escape"", which was, I believe, a commercial failure (because of its satirical nature). This movie gets back to more serious roots, but it seems like the damage had already been done. The budget is paper-thin, and the run-time clocks in at just under 90 minutes. Of all the movies in the Apes franchise, this is the one that could have been expanded into something much more epic. Instead, it gets a rather bland, low-budget treatment.Overall, though, I can still enjoy ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" because of those ape revolt scenes and the great character of Caesar. By this point, if you haven\'t ""bought in"" to the series you won\'t even be watching, so it is for the true Ape-heads.', ""This movie is not as good as the first & third film in my honest opinion but it is on par with the second movie, as it tries to be thought provoking which is a good thing. However a lot of the so called logic just does not add up which can become frustrating to the audience, so you have to separate the good parts of the movie away from the badly scripted to be able to enjoy.Over all a decent 6 out of 10 movie, as films should mostly inspire in it's audience a feeling of enjoyment & sometimes make you think about life.""]";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, Michael Kelly and Ty Burrell are all great. Zack Snyder's direction is excellent, really kinetic and visceral. The music by Tyler Bates and the soundtrack are both really good. However, it's brought down slightly by the ending (after the credits)."", ""It is always risky to shoot a remake of the film which started the genre (well, it wasn't the first film about zombies, but the first which resembles recent ones), and Zack Snyder succeeded in it. Why is it risky and hard? Because the film which starts the genre always sets some rules which all the films of this genre follow. In this film we see absolutely the same as in other zombie movies, whether they are new or old ones: people try to save themselves from zombies, conflict and get bitten. Very frequent trick is also showing that people are bigger monsters than zombies, which is also present in this movie. By the way, because of some bad security guys which appear in the beginning of the movie, I first thought this will be a cliche zombie movie. And though sometimes it is, it has numerous strong sides. Actors are pretty good and their characters are diverse. Here we have strong woman nurse character, a couple of freak guards, one of which saves everyone in the end, young couple of teens who want to be inseparable, interesting sniper Andy, responsible policeman, weird man who ties his pregnant zombie wife to give birth to a zombie child and rich selfish guy Steve. This different characters are quite well represented and you understand every one of them, though there is a lot of characters and film is not that long. This is due to a decent script for a zombie horror. My favorite characters are Sarah Polley's and Ving Rhames' ones. The plot is quite gripping in the end, and basically film gets more and more interesting each 20 minutes. Beginning is a typical zombie horror opening, but in the end due to good character development and some interesting moments it gets much better. Directing of Snyder is decent enough in this film as well. Thanks for the R rating which made film more realistic.Summing up I can say that though it's not a masterpiece for me, it surely is one of the best zombie movies of 00's and you can spend a good evening watching it. If you like zombie movies you can appreciate it much more than I do."", ""Dawn of the Dead starts just like any other ordinary day for nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) as she goes home after another long shift, she & her husband Luis (Justin Louis) go to bed & have a good nights sleep. The next morning Luis is woken by Vivian (Hannah Lochner), their next door neighbours young girl, who proceeds to bite Luis on the neck. Ana manages to push Vivian out of the room & locks the door, Luis dies in front of her but suddenly comes back to life & attacks Ana in the same frenzied way Vivian attacked him. Ana climbs out of the bathroom window & sees complete pandemonium outside as the dead are returning to life & attacking the living, Ana gets into her car & speeds off but ends up crashing. She is found by a cop named Kenneth (Ving Rhames) who in turn find a guy named Michael (Jake Weber) along with Andre (Mekhi Phifer) & his pregnant wife Luda (Inna Korobkina) who all decide to head to the local shopping mall to find safety. They break in & watch in horror as the streets outside become overrun by flesh eating zombies while the TV news broadcasts offer little hope, if any...Directed by first timer Zack Snyder Dawn of the Dead was apparently described as a 'reimagining' of George A. Romero's utterly brilliant Dawn of the Dead (1978) which itself was a sequel to his groundbreaking Night of the Living Dead (1968) which already has already been remade so I guess Dawn of the Dead was next in line & I personally think the result is less than inspiring. There are two versions available, the theatrical cut & a longer director's cut, unfortunately I watched the shorter theatrical version because that's the one they showed on TV even though I have the director's cut on DVD but just hadn't got round to watching it before it aired on TV, I wish I had because I don't really feel like watching it again despite the promise of some extra gore but I suppose that's irrelevant... The script by James Gunn is actually quite different from the original except the title & the fact that some of it is set in a shopping mall, I think that almost everything that made the '78 original so brilliant is lost or diluted here. The start of the film is completely different & in my opinion the best part of this 'reimagining' as it's rather effective & well built up, once the film gets to the mall not that much actually happens to be honest as straight away it's empty with only two zombies inside, there's no running around shooting zombies, there's no hiding out, there's no locking or blocking the doors off, there's no raid by the bikers & it all seems rather stale, static & predictable. Then there's the character's, there's just too many of them & there's no real connection between them unlike the original which had a tight group of four close friends this time around they are a bunch of unlikeable underdeveloped clichés like the self serving yuppie, the 'strong' female, the big cop, the middle class hero & the antagonistic redneck. I was also disappointed with the lack of social satire, unlike Romero's original which had meaning this is a shallow film where the mall is used as a place to hide & nothing more. When Dawn of the Dead '04 does do something different like the zombie baby or the fact the zombies actually run it goes nowhere & they seem like afterthoughts just for the hell of it. Having said that Dawn of the Dead '04 is far from a bad film, it moves along at nice pace, it has some decent if unspectacular set-pieces & action scenes, I must admit I really liked the ending with the video taped footage during the closing credits, it's very sleek & it certainly passes 100 odd minutes entertainingly enough but it had an almost impossible task to better the original which it most definitely doesn't in any way.Director Snyder does OK & there's plenty of homages to the original including cameo's from Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger & the ever watchable Tom Savini along with the BP trucks from the original turning up as does the WGON traffic helicopter also from the original. Gore wise I thought Dawn of the Dead '04 was very disappointing, there's no big gore scenes unlike the original, there's nothing in here to rival the screwdriver in the ear or the zombie having the top of his head sliced off by helicopter blades or zombies having machetes shoved into their faces or the gruesome cannibalistic scenes at the end. All this new version has to offer are better looking zombies, some gunshot wounds to the head, a spike through a zombies head, a poker through a zombies eye & after that I'm actually struggling, there's nothing here that memorable that will have people talking unlike Dawn of the Dead '78.With a supposed budget of about $28,000,000 Dawn of the Dead '04 obviously is better made than the original with that big budget Hollywood polish about it, it's well made & has good special effects. Apparently the budget for Dawn of the Dead '04 was 'significantly slashed' by Universal after the critical & commercial failure of House of the Dead (2003). The acting is forgettable, I must admit I disliked most of the character's in this.Dawn of the Dead is a perfectly watchable & entertaining horror film that is certainly worth a watch but I think it pales into insignificance when compared to Dawn of the Dead '78, it seems to have a good reputation but it just didn't for much for me. However if you like shallow story lines, poor character's & no stand out set-pieces then you too might like it. Good but not brilliant & overall pretty disappointing."", ""Honestly it isn't bad for a remake the movie is more about action then horror but it's worth a watch and this movie started my thrill for zombie movies."", 'I have to say up front that I am a huge fan of the horror movies. They have been and always will be my favorite form of movies. Unfortunately, This was a comedy and not a horror. SPOILERS: Let me remind you of a few jokes about this film before you can say that it was at all good. 1) Why were some people that were bitten turned into zombies after 5 minutes yet others after a couple days? 2) Why is it that when they went into the garage to turn on the breakers they were chased by zombies that could get in, but while working on their tanks....I mean buses there was not a zombie in sight? 3)When leaving the mall wasnt it at all kinda funny that they are surrounded by atleast 2000 zombies, then they throw a propane tank that lands 5 feet away from the bus that explodes into a thermo nuclear bomb that kills all the zombies within a 100 yards but the bus is left unscathed? 4) Did I mention that they turned 2 buses into tanks in a matter of a day or 2? 5) How and why did the girl go to the gun shop across the street when she saw her dog was fine? Also how did she manage to get downstairs and into the truck in a matter of 30 secs? By the way, werent they saying getting to the truck would be impossible yet a 14 year old did it. hmmm. These are just a handful of jokes that i found amusing while watching this film. I think overall the film was terrible, plot was a joke, and if I had a chance to watch this or zombie lake it would be a real tough toss up. 1 out of 10 stars and thats just cause a few of the original characters were featured in the film.', ""Returning from a busy day in the hospital, Ana spends time with her husband when a neighbours daughter comes into the house and attacks her husband. He dies before returning to life and attacking Ana. She runs and escapes in her car, driving through a neighbourhood rife with violence and fires.  After crashing her car, she hooks up with a group of armed survivors who take refuge in a mall.  The group settle in and fortify their position as an army of the undead gather outside.Before I start my review, let me just say that this will be biased as I am always easily won over by zombie movies.  The fact that they just keep coming (fast or slow), lack character and only want to kill really just freaks me out.  So I tend to get easily scared by the genre (even if `enjoy' is perhaps not the right word) and be easily more negligent towards their faults.  Despite telling myself that I wouldn't bother with this film as it would scare me, I went for it anyway in a fit of `confront your fears' type of stupidity!  The film starts with a creepy opening and pretty much manages to keep the pace up for the whole film.  It, like the zombies, moves fast and brutally throughout and is very, very tense.Others have complained about the lack of gore - however I found the graphic exploding heads to do that more than enough for my tastes!  Better than gore is the atmosphere.  The use of news footage is not original but it succeeds (along with the aerial view of the town) in creating the impression of a world turning to sh*t.  I don't know about you but this scares me and the film did it well.  The speed of the zombie attacks makes for a thrilling ride and it did make me very tense - Snyder managed to make the whole film a threat (especially for a first time director) and I honestly have a very stiff neck a day after seeing this simply because my body was tensed up for the whole film!The pace of the film also serves to cover the real problems in content and plot.  Unlike the original there is no satirical swipe on consumerism - the fact that the zombies are just wandering aimlessly around the mall like they used to in life is pretty much ignored here - but times are very different now I guess.  The plot itself also has quite a few stupid moments where the characters act in a way you know they wouldn't in real life.  For example people go on suicide missions for little real reasons and you can tell that the script is just doing it to create more action.  However, when you are into it, these things don't really seem to matter.  The film may be a little silly when you think about it but it does have a good ending - downbeat and realistic (or at least as realistic as it can be!) and left me with no hope of a happy ending - in this regard it is everything that `28 Days Later..' is not.The cast is good even if the script places their characters secondary to the action.  Polley is used to slightly more substantial roles but still does well here.  Rhames is lumbered with a religious background that is never explained, but he is a great presence throughout.  Weber is the standout role however.  His character is a slightly less cartoon version of Evil Dead's Ash.  He is the unwilling hero but yet he seems to accept all the obstacles he comes across.  He also manages to be one of the group that the audience cares about - most of them are fodder and we know it!  Phifer is a good actor but seemed too `gangster' to really be driven to this degree by his family.  The rest of the support cast are mostly just there to get eaten but they do OK.Overall this is not a great film - but it is an effective one.  As a film it lacks subtext, comment and plot logic. However as a thriller it is fast paced, gripping and tense with a satisfyingly bleak conclusion.  Snyder does a good job as a first timer and creates an atmosphere that is gripping even if it lacks originality.  Like I said, I don't deal with zombie movies very well and am easily scared but I reckon that this should satisfy many a Saturday night thrill-seeking crowd even if it does nothing for your brain apart from it's risk getting eaten."", ""(SPOILER WARNING)I won't be a complete close-minded critic of the remake of the new Dawn of the Dead remake, but I do have to be critical about it, not just for my own piece of mind, but because I think the original happens to have a crucial place in horror, and indeed all of cinema, history.  When Romero created his film it was definitely original, or at least an original riff on what he had started a decade before.  It had laughs, but it didn't over-do it in cheesy-ness, and there was a constant sense of doom and satire when dealing with the apocalyptic climate of his slow-moving, blue-ish & pale zombies roaming the country-sides.Now we have Zack Snyder, working from a script by James Gunn, who has decided to take on Romero's view of society and sense of horror for 2004. As I left the theater I felt similar, coincidentally, to how I felt after I first watched Tom Savini's remake of 'Night' years ago - yes, the make-up and special effects are improved, yes there are some effective scares here and there, and yes, every once in a while there's a laugh at a zombie's expense.  But, and here's a question for horror fans, why should it have been titled Dawn of the Dead?  Yeah, it takes the concept of the survivors in the mall, and it has some bits of dialog lifted from Romero's script. However, there I would say draws the line for the similarities.  In a way, I felt like the filmmakers could've just ripped Romero's material off, given the film a different title, and I wouldn't of thought and felt the story and attack sequences were not entirely improvements on the original but, well, mutations.Because, as a zombie film in and of itself, set aside from the reality that it is a remake (this is for all you who didn't see the original yet and are thinking of seeing this one first), it's not a poorly made or deplorable work.  The acting is also dependable, especially by the likes of a strong lead in Rhames, an interesting female lead in Polley, a chilling supporting role in Phiefer, and plenty of well-balanced work turned in by character actors like Weber and Burrell.  As I said, the make-up is impressive (er, for it's Hollywood budget), and there's one scene involving a pregnant woman that did have me glued to my seat.But then there came the problems I had with the film, and it wasn't just that not enough time and patience was given to develop the characters more appropriately or give the story a certain juicy-ness Romero had pouring out of him.  Now, I don't think running zombies are a cause for total uproar - I thought it was highly effective in 28 Days Later, as prime example - yet I may not be the only one who thinks that there's something just slightly eerie and exact to how the living-dead moved in Romero's films as opposed to Snyder's.  There are the explanations I've heard from various zombie fanatics (many on this site) to explain it, but it's almost irrelevant to explain it for a genre such as this.  The living-dead exist entirely in the 'movie world', and since this film doesn't even bother to explain how the virus got started (the original didn't explain it either, but it didn't have to as it was a sequel to a film that did explain it in its sci-fi quality), saying one is more shocking than the other doesn't give much justice to how people will react person to person.  As for the other flaws, I thought the dog element was a little under-cooked (is dog too good for their tastes, huh?), a number of times the dialog felt forced, and also the very end left a bad taste in my mouth.  I won't say much about it, but the last scenes in this film remind me what separates such a remake from an original horror film from the 1970's - a minor lack of respect for audience intelligence and expectations.Maybe I've been sounding biased in parts of my review, that I should recognize that it's a revision, and it should be respected.  I do respect it, and it wasn't a disappointment.  As I left the theater though, I realized something that also came to me after I left the Texas Chain Saw Massacre remake (which was a huge mess any way to look at it), and also after seeing the remake of Cape Fear recently (a film of which I haven't seen the original yet, which I fear I may not like as much, though time will tell).  Some movies may be seen when we are young, and they may leave such an impression, especially after multiple viewings, that the first notion of a remake sounds ridiculous.  It's not to say that when a director has an idea of how they personally want to improve on a classic it's not warranted. But, with some films, it's often very challenging to be equalized let alone top them.  A number of films may improve on originals, giving the original director a taste of what new blood has to offer for the genre.  In dealing with Dawn of the Dead, I won't be a movie-snob and say that a remake should not have been attempted let alone executed.  It's not a failure - it's just not anything I'll pay to see again unless it's on cable.  Note of interest to fans, they're (for gag value I suppose) cameos with original stars like Ken Foree and Tom Savini, though for not much other purpose than to remind viewers it's a remake.  Oh well - (strong) B"", 'I saw this movie after - and only after - I had been assured that it compared favorably to the original.  I\'ll never be able to trust those people again.  This is another ""horror"" film that isn\'t scary, isn\'t original in any way, and doesn\'t have any particular redeeming value whatsoever.  It\'s shot like a typical commercial or music video director would shoot, and the story suffers in the same way - there is no real character development and no dramatic development to sustain a feature length.  What we do have here is essentially the video game version of the original.  Retained are the shoot-em-up scenes of zombie butchery, but gone are the elements of humor and humanity that made the original so original in the first place.  The only attempts at humanizing the film are so utterly misplaced as to be absurd or laughable.  It\'s a one note movie and that note is one that really ought to leave it\'s audience feeling disgusted at the end - not because of the gore, but because of the utter waste of time we have been subjected to.']";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Flash Gordon is, in my opinion, the guiltiest pleasure of them all. Cardboard characters, lunatic script, embarrassing dialogue, trashy performances (apart from Max Von Sydow), and hilarious special effects... yet the one thing that comes out in the film\'s favour is that, despite its seemingly countless faults, it is still irresistibly entertaining.American football legend Flash Gordon (Sam J. Jones) and sexy babe Dale Arden (Melody Anderson) are aboard a private flight when a weird red-storm forces them to perform an emergency landing. They crash into the back garden of wacky ex-NASA scientist Hans Zarkov (Topol), an eccentric madman who believes the world is under attack from alien forces and who has built his own spaceship to do battle with the enemy. Astonishingly, it turns out that Zarkov was right - and pretty soon, Flash, Dale and Zarkov find themselves on the planet Mongo, battling against its tyrannical emperor Ming the Merciless (Max Von Sydow), with a little help from Ming\'s treacherous daughter (Ornella Muti), her lover Barin (Timothy Dalton), and the winged warrior Vultan (Brian Blessed).Flash Gordon is an absolutely insane film. The set design is remarkable, as is the costume design, and a pounding rock soundtrack is provided by the group Queen. Performance-wise, everyone seems to be camping it up like an end-of-term pantomime, though Von Sydow somehow seems to give his villain a deliciously sinister edge.

As the Turtles are celebrating their victory, an ex-hockey player called Casey Jones, having become a vigilante to combat the crime wave, is shown beating two thieves with his sports equipment and arguing with Raphael over the proper way to punish criminals. The crime wave is traced by April to the Foot Clan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"[""This final installment in the series may be a bit corny, but it sure as hell does provide us with some action. Humans and apes are again at war, and as a result a lot of stuff explodes, that's pretty much the summary. The usual philosophic remarks are thrown in, but they just work up to the battle the title promised. The action scenes are pretty chaotic but still look good, especially the scene early in the movie where they enter the forbidden zone/undergrond parking lot works out well. By this time the actors knew what they were making and seemed to be loving it, Claude Akins hams it up like crazy. His portrayal of man-hating general Aldo has one dimension, and that dimension is really built to last. We meet Aldo and he's angry, we see him again later and he's angry, and then finally he's well what do you know, angry. His best scene comes near the ending though, you'll know it when you see it. You can say a lot of negative things about this movie, but boring it ain't."", ""In my opinion this film is underrated it is not a great film by any means but is better than Beneath The Planet Of The Apes and Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes. This is the fifth and final chapter in the ape saga and in my opinion it didn't disappoint the planet is a desolated place, Ceasar wants apes and humans to live together however ape has the edge over man as leaders and the humans fight back... This film stars Roddy McDowell, Claude Akins & Natalie Trundy this film was directed by J.Lee Thompson i recommend this film even though it has a low rating on IMDb it is an enjoyable film so watch and enjoy THE FINAL CONFRONTATION***/*****"", 'So the final entry in the Planet of the Apes series takes liberties with the timeline and the plot wanders through other prior installments, but I feel the movie delivers a degree of pathos seldom seen in a sequel. The bookend scenes involving the Lawgiver, John Huston in heavy make up, speaking to a group of schoolchildren--apes and humans--tie up the saga nicely, leaving open the future for more sequels.(Tim Burton in his dreadful remake should have filled in the blanks instead of ""reimagining"" a different world of apes. Only my opinion.) Things I like include the character Mandemus, keeper of the armory(Caesar\'s conscience), the trek to the radioactive city, Caesar\'s viewing of his dead parents in the Hall of Records and the final ambiguous shot of the movie. The money allocated to Leonard Rosenman\'s impressive score was well spent. The pop singer Paul Williams display a deft touch for acting in his debut. Try and catch this screen gem on Fox Movie Channel and you will be treated to additional scenes involving the always looming doomsday bomb. And special praise to J.Lee Thompson for delivering more with less.', ""A limp way for the original franchise to finish.Its predecessor, 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes', was a weak entry too but remained watchable, though 'Battle for the Planet of the Apes' kinda straddles the other side as it's uninteresting. I didn't dislike it and it is very short at around 82 minutes, which helps. Roddy McDowall is the pick of the cast, though even his performance feels weary at this point.A 'strong' 2½* rating from me, if such a thing exists. It was the right time for them to end this (very good, all in all) series."", ""SPOILERS ON WHOLE SERIESI'll not say I like this movie - it IS pants, but having seen it recently after all the other 4 in succession I realised something I had never understood before. Some of you might already know this and hence think I'm dumb .. OK, others might disagree with me .. also OK but this is intended for those of you who had the same viewpoint on the series as I previously did.I had thought that the films III, IV and V had simply explained events prior to the first movie but after seeing Battle again, I saw that the past had been changed due to the apes going back in time after the destruction of the earth. Here are my reasons, and the evidence grows stronger as episode 3 progresses to episode 5 :Episode 3 : In the timeline before episode 1, no talking apes had arrived in the 20th century therefore the past has already begun to change. Cornelius claims an ape named Aldo had been the one who first spoke the word 'No' to his masters. He also revealed the plague of cats and dogs was in another century than the 20th (I forget which).Episode 4 : The plague of cats and dogs has already taken place - the bacteria obviously having been brought back from the future by the 3 apes in the spacecraft. Cornelius' son is the ape to give rise to revolution - not Aldo as he had claimed in part 3.Episode 5 : The entire film can basically be forgotten except for the ending. The battle scene is particularly useless, having been more like an end-of-episode fight from the A-Team rather than a battle for the destiny of a planet. However, we end with the statue of the lawgiver as Caesar (a chimpanzee), and not one of an orangutan as shown in the first two movies. We also see ape and human children sitting side by side as equals, which is perhaps the biggest hint.For me, this put the series into a new perspective and I appreciate it more now. What had previously appeared to be inconsistencies between episodes turned out to be intended differences.Any comments on the above are most welcome - agree or disagree or just call me stupid for not realising this is blatantly obvious to the rest of you! I apologise in advance for any factual errors I have made due to this being all from memory and no references being consulted."", 'Rarely does the restoration of deleted scenes added back into a film work to its benefit. The Extended Edition of Battle for the Planet of the Apes is one of those rare exceptions. The fifth and final chapter in the Apes theatrical series is generally regarded as its weakest link. It had the lowest budget of all of the films in the series and it painfully shows and looks more like it\'s a made-for-TV movie. In fact, it feels almost like a pilot for the Planet of the Apes Television Series.The film begins in the year 2670 and is bookended with John Houston as the revered ape Lawgiver reading from the sacred scrolls like a bedtime storyteller. From here the story is told in flashback and the viewer is left scratching their heads by the befuddling logic. Events not clearly explained are left to the viewer to make assumptions or draw conclusions about the contradictory order of events. It must be assumed that a nuclear war had devastated the Earth immediately after the ape uprising in Conquest and somehow only a decade afterward the ape society had unbelievably evolved their verbal powers of speech and intelligence. These facts are inconsistent with Cornelius\' explanation of the apes\' evolution in Escape in which he explains that the plague that destroyed all cats and dogs occurred some 200 years later than it did in Conquest and that Aldo was the first ape to utter human speech when he said the word ""No"" which was spoken by Lisa in Conquest, and that Aldo led the revolt against the humans which was led by Caesar. We can only conclude that the incongruent events in Conquest and Battle are the events of an alternate timeline forged by the creation of the temporal paradox from Cornelius and Zira\'s arrival in Escape. The apes also adorn costumes similar to the fashions of the ape society from the first film which had evolved over several thousand years but again this is only a decade after their revolt against the humans (one explanation could be that since this story is told as a flashback to ape and human children we are seeing it as depicted by their imaginations as a point of reference). MacDonald in this film is not the same MacDonald who was the Governor\'s Adjutant in Conquest but rather his brother which is confusing since Caesar appeared to have found a human sympathizer and ally in the MacDonald from Conquest and the only reasonable explanation for the deliberate change of character is that MacDonald is played by a different actor this time, but if you aren\'t paying close attention, you are likely to miss that inference. Ape City is located in a very lush and hospitable forest area within miles of the inhospitable desert wasteland of the annihilated Forbidden City. Automobiles such as jeeps and school buses still work somehow and were not rendered inoperable by the EMP of the atomic detonation. Radioactive half-life apparently only affects the surviving humans living within the irradiated remains of the Forbidden City and the apes can somehow sustain bombardments of high levels of radioactive fallout for a few hours while they search its archives for a videotape of Cornelius and Zira which also amazingly happened to not be vaporized or magnetically degaussed by the atomic blast. The mutated humans all wear skull caps for the purpose of (take your pick): A.) protecting their craniums from high radiation levels B.) to hide the fact that their hair has completely fallen out due to radioactive fallout C.) to enhance telepathic reception of their now-suddenly mutated telekinetic minds or D.) All of the above.The newly restored scenes with the human mutants and the Alpha-Omega bomb at least help to make some sense of the rather weak narrative and gaps of logic and provide some continuity to the rest of the series. These scenes are significant because it shows the mutants beginning to hone their developing telepathic powers and it establishes the fundamental doctrine of their quasi-religious sect that will worship the Alpha-Omega bomb in future generations. It almost feels more like a direct prequel to Beneath now. Why this subplot was excised is almost as baffling as the film\'s logic but one reason perhaps is the fact that the film ends with a more optimistic outlook suggesting that the timeline of events were changed when Caesar united the apes and the humans and that the crisis of Beneath may have been averted but it is left open for the audience to decide from the ambiguous tear of the weeping statue of Caesar suggesting that perhaps the fateful events of the future cannot be avoided after all.Battle is definitely the worst of the five apes films but compared to most low-budget sci-fi shlock I\'ve seen, it\'s really not as bad as it\'s made out to be, but judged against the superior standard set precedent by the first film it is a quite a disappointment. In addition to the restored scenes, there are few highlights that make the film worth at least a viewing if you have enjoyed watching the other films in this series at all. Of particular interest are the sets of the melted down post-apocalyptic Forbidden City that are just visually interesting to look at, even if the obvious matte paintings were composited into the background. It gives the film a future-coda feel in a way that evokes images of James Cameron\'s The Terminator but pre-dates it over a decade. If nothing else, Battle was at least influential in inspiring other science fiction films in the genre and was the template for subsequent franchises and was more than influential to George Lucas and his Star Wars mega-merchandising empire that would follow only a few years later and the Planet of the Apes series would forever be buried under its apocalypse and reside in the realm of Saturday afternoon and late-night television broadcasts.', ""The last of the original series takes place a decade or so after its predecessor. There's an Ape City, run by Caesar, the benevolent ruler played by Roddy McDowall, and its human denizens are servants to their simian cousins. Caesar's aide tells him of a place in the Forbidden City, now decimated by nuclear strikes, where video footage of Caesar's parents exists. Caesar has no memories of his parents, who were killed when he was a baby, so he, his aide, and the wise Virgil (Paul Williams) travel to the city and encounter a band of now-mutated humans who live in some squalor and are led by Kolp (Severn Darden). Kolp, learning of the apes' arrival, decides to launch a preemptive strike on Ape City to exterminate them all. Meanwhile, there's dissension among the apes - particularly, the combative General Aldo (Claude Akins), who wants to take over because he likes making war and being the Man. Anyway, the movie isn't as good as those earlier in the series, but it's passable. McDowall is very good, and in fact the ape costumes are still top notch. This is a fitting coda to the series."", ""Okay, by now the series had just about run its course and it was obvious that it would be concluding soon. However, there was one final film for the original series to go and they actually managed to come up with a credible reason for a followup. It was NOT so easy to make movie #3, as the Earth had just blown up and no logical reason could resurrect the series (so, in the 3rd film, they came up with a totally illogical reason!).This film was set only a few years after the fourth film, CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. Unexpectedly, the new society that Caesar set up after the last film was pretty egalitarian and the humans were not all confined to become slaves--though there were a lot of rumblings from the gorillas who for some odd reason carried a grudge after being tortured and enslaved by the humans! One serious flaw with the film, though, is that although this only takes place perhaps a decade later, all the apes are civilized and can talk, use guns, etc. as well as any of the humans! I am a school teacher and I only PRAY that I get students this smart!! Anyways, back to the review. It turns out that although this society is functioning pretty well, not all the humans have fallen to the apes. Nope. Ignorant and nihilistic humans STILL hold out hopes of wiping out the basically decent apes and re-asserting mankind's hold over the planet. Well, without getting into the complex plot, the film boils down to a final battle with the bad humans. The apes win, but in the process the evilness of the gorillas is exposed, as they murder Caesar's son! It seemed the bad gorillas SHOULD have teamed up with the bad humans after all!! The film concludes leaving the viewer to ponder what will become of the perfect ape society--will it actually degenerate to what it would become in movie #1 or would all the positive changes in this movie avert that awful future and the destruction of the Earth?!? I guess we'll never know.The first time I saw this movie, I didn't like it very much. However, in seeing it again, it had a good plot, acting and was a worthy conclusion to the series.A few points in conclusion: it was cool to see the singer Paul Williams as an ape in this movie (it probably took less make-up than usual), there was a short-lived TV series that followed, and if anyone thinks the remake from 2001 was great is an idiot."", 'Yes, it\'s the last of the original movie series, but there would be a brief TV series and then a 25 year gap before it all started up again. Lots of history to fill in, even fictional. So let\'s get this straight. Cesar, the son of Cornelius and Zira (seen briefly in flashbacks), is actually an ancestor most likely of his own parents. This film deals with the aftermath of the education of the simians to be able to speak, and now they are in complete control. Claude Rains is the ill-tempered ape General Aldo who refuses to accept a human (their teacher) saying no to him and displays the animalistic tendencies that take over his educated brain. This makes him the bane of leader Caesar\'s existence, and now a father, all he wants is to maintain peace for the surviving decent humans, but it\'s obviously not going to be with Aldo\'s support. There\'s a human variation of General Aldo with Severn Darden\'s governor of the forbidden city, and he\'s just as vile as Aldo.Legends director John Huston introduces the story as the law maker orangutan in the far off future, setting up for the revelation that a nuclear explosion destroyed the human civilization and somehow the apes survived as well as the humans who are now basically slaves. The story (presumably in the beginning of the 21st century) shows a destroyed city, still contaminated by nuclear poisons, and populated by humans who were obviously descendants of the cult living under Manhattan in the second film. This fills in questions which arose from the first two films, leaving the overall rating of the film based upon details.From Augustus Caesar in ""Cleopatra"" to ape king Caesar here, Roddy McDowall has gone full circle, and he\'s quite commanding as he deals with the power mad Aldo while trying to keep peace and start his own dynasty with wisdom and understanding. You can see the foundations of the ape civilization from 2000 years forward, and this helps with continuity. For fans of the franchise, it\'s an acceptable ending with the family element restored as Roddy and wife Natalie Trundy try to do their best to instill their values in their adorable son Cornelius (Bobby Porter). An evil act by General Aldo sends the battle into a different zone where the law of ""ape shall not kill ape"" is broken and brings Caesar to a point where he has to confront his own moralities.Austin Stoker plays the brother of the character that Hari Rhodes played in the previous film, one of the few humans whom Caesar finds he can relate to. Veteran actor Lew Ayres is recognizable through his voice as the orangutan who manages the ape\'s weapon supply and finds himself in danger when the evil general and his rebels invade, not only with the purpose of destroying the humans advancing on their camp, but Caesar as well. This leads to a very tense conclusion with a stand-off between Caesar and Aldo and a prologue that reveals the circle is not yet complete with the situation between the humans and simians quite different at the end of the 30th Century as it would be where the first film started. It\'s formula in many ways, but still has enough value as it gives the viewer many ethical questions about how we will continue to make the world work as the universe changes.', 'As far as I know, this one usually gets a bad rap, but I\'ve always liked it a lot (but then, it was only the second one I saw, right after ""Conquest""). How can you NOT like Severn Darden as the leader of the mutants? (He really walks a line between being serious and funny, being mainly a comedy actor.) And France Nuyen (in probably a smaller part than she\'d been used to), as his aide, who\'s a little like a secretary with a crush on the boss, only in this weird setting. And Austin Stoker (an actor I know from hardly anything else) as McDonald, Caesar\'s human friend, was very believable. And of course, it was probably the Ape movie with the most well-known actors in ape roles - Claude Akins, Lew Ayres, John Huston, Paul Williams. There\'s one thing I never completely thought about till the last time I saw it (only days ago) - practically the last moment of the story (apart from the crying statue) does something that almost ""deflates"" the ""message"" of these movies - after all the endless strife between the apes and humans in these stories, the last thing you see is the little ape jokingly pulling the hair of the little girl. So even in the sequels (not just the original, which does get credit for this), the writers didn\'t really take the whole thing TOO seriously.', ""The fifth and final of the original Planet of the Apes series. In between the last film and this one, there's been a nuclear holocaust and the remaining humans are slaves of the apes. Caesar (Roddy McDowall) tries to rule in peace but gorilla General Aldo (Claude Akins) wants to eradicate all humans. While searching the ruins of a city for recordings of his parents, Caesar comes across mutant humans who attack the apes. This leads to inevitable conflict between Caesar and Aldo as to how best to deal with this new threat.The least of the Apes movies is still quite good. It has solid acting and a script with good ideas, although it crams in a little more than it should. This was such a good series and it is, I believe, under-appreciated. Yes the first movie is widely praised but the sequels are rarely given their due. They're all smart, entertaining movies that tell a very interesting saga."", ""With a budget of about 10 pence Roddy McDowall shuffles and monologues throughout this snooze fest, the film has slightly interesting concepts of humans being treated as second-class citizens but not slaves like in the 1968 version but it's just too repetitive and takes so much from the previous films. The underground human mutants is ripped straight out of beneath the planet of the apes and it's even less sensical this time round as this is only meant to be a few years after Conquest.The action in this was laughable and had no tension to it, the end fight was a massive failure. The best things about this film was General Aldo (a humorous but psychopathic ape) and some of the speeches on morality and treating everyone equally were mildly interesting.2/10: Just not interesting at all"", '""Battle for the Planet of Apes"" is not the worst of the original five. It\'s obviously not the best. However, it is a satisfying watch for me. It pulls very high on the nostalgia scale. I grew up watching the original five. ""Battle..."" is not a lazy effort. It\'s just a kind of low budget one. It\'s a pretty ambitious movie (as were the previous four ""Apes"" movies). It deals with some serious subjects. The clash of cultures, the rule of law and militarism. Maybe the actual battle is a bit of a letdown but I think that more to do with the budget than anything else. As far as the entire series goes";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Also, the action scene's were decent too, though the chase with the cement truck was'nt as good as the chase in the first with the transport truck.  I did notice that the film lacked the freshness of the first one but still it was fun to watch."", ""Sequel to the hugely successful 1984 movies, this film was most unfairly slated by critics. I believe in some ways it is better than the original and certainly far, far better than the third installment. The story is, despite what everyone says, very engaging and keeps you watching the whole time. Eddie Murphy starred in Coming to America shortly after this, and then his career took a nosedive, although he seems to be making a comeback. If he is given more roles like this, he'll do better."", ""Beverly Hills Cop 2 is pretty much just the same as the original Beverly Hills Cop but without the freshness and originality of the 1st.

There is a motherload of crappy fantasy flicks out there and this one is better than most. I was kinda young when I saw it and didn't find it too violent but some parents may think it gruesome at times. I myself feel that gave it an edge. Along with swordplay there are nasty trolls,a 2-headed beast,mean-spirited characters and some intense scenes at the end. Of course there are lots of special effects. This was a technically well made film with awesome cinematography and interesting locations. Every now and again Fox airs the movie but it's 2 1/2 hr running  can be really cut. Ya gotta see it!"", 'It\'s one of those films they starting SUPER GREAT and you saying ""Oh my God, what a gem I found""... and as the film continues its getting less better and ends almost bad.To me, the first 40 minutes are AMAZING, probably equal to ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy!!!! Trust me, THAT GOOD!

They tried to make a fantasy epic with ""Willow"" and they came close. Unfortunately, ""Willow"" misses the mark. It looks great but the story is weak. I first saw ""Willow"" in the theater and I liked it but I don\'t like it as much now. The best part of the movie now was the best part of the movie back then, a wildly dreamy Joanne Whalley.', 'I was reluctant to go back and watch ""Willow"", because it was a favourite of my childhood, and its star, Warwick Davis, was a hero of mine. After I loved ""Willow"" my mum told me that Davis played the Ewok in Return of the Jedi, and that was it: instant hero worship.Unfortunately I was right to be wary. ""Willow"" isn\'t as good as I\'d remembered. I still liked it, but it has long passages where my attention wandered, such as chases and bloodless PG battle scenes.The charisma of Davis and the chutzpah of making a movie with a mostly little-person cast (including the legendary Billy Barty) still kind of won me over, but I wish that same bravado could have extended to some of the set pieces, which seemed recycled from other movies.', ""I have seen this movie in my childhood days that too iam lucky to have this seen in a good theatre. My dad took me to this wonderful and magical movie I really enjoyed this great flick and I still remember each and every single scenes in this movie. Warwick Davis and Val Kilmer were top of their forms truly impressive performance by both. You have to see this movie to believe it's magical world and it's witches and sorcery!

Two thumps up!."", ""I remember really liking this movie as a kid and I was pretty sure it's one of those you probably shouldn't revisit as an adult. Because I want to watch the new TV show that just came out, I went against my gut feeling... and I was right. I'm hoping the little ones can still find magic in this movie but it definitely hasn't aged well, from the uneven pacing, to the overacting, and of course the terrible special effects. There are other similar movies from the 80s that hold up better so I know I'm just not harsh toward a product of its time, and it really suffers from several flaws. So I did not really enjoy it outside of the nostalgia but again, very young kids might."", ""Considering how few really good fantasy movies there are out there, this one has to rate pretty high.  It is a rather good movie that is fast paced and fun, but it does contain flaws.  The main one is Warwick Davis.  In some scenes he is good, but in other scenes his character comes off as a bit too whiny.  The story is kind of a take off of The Lord of the Rings books.  A man, small in statute, has to keep a baby safe from an evil queen who wants to sacrifice it cause it may grow up to kill her.  While protecting the child Willow (Davis' character) runs into a swordsman played by Val Kilmer. He does a great job playing this character and is my favorite character in the movie.  Some of the effects are good, and some quite lame (the two little guys accompanying Willow), but considering this was 1987 you can overlook this.  The battle scenes are ok (the one at the abandoned castle is the best), but they are just not on the scale of other movies of this type. This movie is worth a look though."", ""A wonderful fantasy full with lots of wonderful creatures and characters. The plot is great and the cast is brilliant.

Together they form a great Hollywood cop team. Certainly they have enough chemistry for countless sequels.', 'Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you\'re not able to take a classic action buddy cop movie of all time, ignore this review, as well. We\'ll both be better off.Lethal Weapon (1987) is my favorite classic action the best Christmas flick alongside Die Hard! It was always my favorite action flick from Richard Donner and Shane Black beside Superman (1978). If the Godfather is the Godfather of all gangster flicks, then Lethal Weapon is the Godfather of all buddy-buddy action cop flicks! In the summer of \'87 director Richard Donner gave us Riggs and Murtaugh. Lethal Weapon is one of the Greatest Action Movies from the 80\'s. This is the movie I grew up and it is my childhood movie! You should know all of the great action movies: Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Dirty Harry, etc. This movie is a classic. Movie was the best cop movie EVER! It showed that cops are human too and have the same faults as the rest of us. The action scenes were great and keep you engaged through the whole movie. Gary Busey and Danny Glover both started in Predator 2. I think the man Gary Busey is very underrated actor for playing action hero\'s and villains. I think he did the best job ever. I seriously love him in Lethal Weapon and Predator 2!The first one in the Lethal Weapon series is a really fun 80s action flick! It\'s one of my favorite action movies of all time. I love this movie to death I love it!!! And the chemistry between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson is just flawless. The deserts scenes are outstanding and really fantastic in which Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) attempt to rescue Murtaugh\'s daughter Rianne (Traci Wolfe) in the desert, Riggs provides cover for Murtaugh using a Heckler & Koch PSG-1 sniper rifle with a high-capacity magazine and Harris bipod. He succeeds in taking out several Shadow Company goons and is about to shoot Mr. Joshua when General McAllister (Mitchell Ryan) interferes and captures him, later seen carrying the rifle across his back while escorting the captured Riggs.Lethal Weapon is the 1987 action film that was one of the first in the modern ""buddy cop"" genre. Mel Gibson stars as LAPD Detective Martin Riggs, a cop who lives on the ragged edge and who could be suicidal, much to the chagrin of his new partner Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), who is celebrating his 50th birthday. Together they uncover a drug smuggling ring that involves a criminal gang comprised of mercenaries and former members of a CIA / special forces ""Black Ops"" unit with ties to the Vietnam War. The film was written by Shane Black and directed by Richard Donner (Superman: The Movie). The success of the movie would help spawn a film franchise that spanned four films as well as numerous movie imitators.Of course, this wouldn\'t be an action movie without some action. There\'s plenty of it, and it\'s perfectly done. The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, McAllister has no control over the accelerator and brake pedals, so he can only steer as the car enters a main street, where it\'s t-boned by a large bus and flipped over. The general is upside down, bleeding, surrounded by bags of drugs and several grenades. When McAllister is trying to reach and grabbing the grenades, they all explode, destroying the car and him). The gunplay is delivered in perfect Richard Donner style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you\'ll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you\'ll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans: sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable. In the Murtaugh\'s house the wall of the living room caves in and an empty police car crashes into the room, a police baton wedged onto the accelerator. Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey) shoots a T. V. displaying a Christmas commercial with his Colt XM177 Commando at Murtaugh\'s home and fires all round in the police car. The fighting sequences between Joshua (Gray Busey) and Riggs (Mel Gibson) is very realistic! You don\'t see any realistic fighting scenes in any action movie like that!This movie is the best action packed filled with a lot of entrainment, excitement, joy, laughs and a lot of action sequences! It is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, great acting, the flying sequences between Riggs and suicide jumper is outstanding but a really crazy stunt, I have ever seen. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. I love this movie, it is the finest action movie of all time ever made!!!!! This first entry in the series that would spawn 3 sequels and countless duplicates, is the darker of the set. But the action and violence is played up and this one is a classic from first view to the next.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Warner Bros.

One of the best action/comedy/buddy films of all time with Gibson as suicidal loose cannon maverick cop Martin Riggs mismatched with partner Roger Murtaugh (Glover in one great comic role), who is constantly reminded of his age and the danger he's constantly in: solving a drug-linked homicide of Murtaugh's friend's daughter.  Busey is memorable as an albino mercenary, Mr. Joshua, unsusceptible to pain.  Some great stunts and lots of thrills thanks to helmsman Richard Donner (who also directed the sequels)."", ""Lethal Weapon has a pretty abrupt start to proceedings as the opening scene shows a young woman jumping off a balcony from towards the top of a tower block and landing on a car. However, this proves to have some relevance to the plot of Lethal Weapon.Basically veteran cop Murtagh (Glover)is assigned to investigate this incident which is initially deemed to be a 'suicide'. However, an autopsy confirms that the young woman was poisoned before she jumped, therefore she was murdered before she jumped. Murtagh must try to find out who poisoned the young woman and why, but he's not alone in investigating this case and is assigned a partner Riggs (Gibson). Riggs is a suicidal, unhinged police officer who has a very different method of policing to the more 'by the book' Murtagh.The majority of the humour stems from scenes with Murtagh and Riggs as both of them have a completely different style of policing. Murtagh is more straight laced and has more of a general regard for following police procedure. Whereas Riggs is unorthodox and wild and will go to more extreme methods (as you'll see in the scene where he's on the roof with a potential suicide victim). The character development is also good. Riggs in particular is afforded some depth - we learn that his wife of 11 years was killed in a car accident which explains his suicidal tendencies - it perhaps also helps to explain his rather 'gung ho' approach to policing (as he already feels suicidal, he probably doesn't fear death as much as your average police officer). We also see Murtagh's home life and see that he is a real family man. Both men show their human side, but also show that they can kick a lot of ass when necessary.There were a couple of problems with Lethal Weapon";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With good story telling, realistic acting (apart from some dodgy accents) and big explosions, it's all quite compelling.Without going into the story too much, 5 Jewish hit men are assigned to assassinate the 11 perpetrators of the 1972 Munich Olympics hostage disaster. All the hits are styled in a hand held camera fashion, which adds great tension and realism in true Spielberg style. Yes, the action is exceptional. There are two fantastic scenes where the hit men themselves get caught up in their own hit i.e. Explosives and being too close when it goes off.Although Munich plays accurately to the tragic 1972-hostage situation (so I believe), it's still a ham-fisted film. Some scenes don't knit together well and confuse cinema-goers, especially after the two-hour mark. That's when the film really goes down hill, but I'll get to the crap ending soon...so please be patient The overall style of the film plays like a documentary at times, especially the start. When story kicks in, it's all very typical of Spielberg and his limited view of outer USA. In a way this isn't a criticism, more of a observation i.e. When in Paris we see the Eiffel Tower, when in Amsterdam everybody rides push bikes, and so on. Clichés like this are always prevalent with American filmmakers. I was disappointed when in London we didn't see the Tower or Big Ben, although it was raining.Now to the big issue, and it is big my friends. This is a big spoiler so stop reading now if spoilers aren't your thing. The ending, apart from being 30 minutes too long is awful. The camera splits between Eric Bana (Avner) having sex with his wife and the final act of the hostage talking where the hostages are brutally shot and blown up in a helicopter all synchronised with Avners almighty orgasm. It was truly sickening. Spielberg's a master filmmaker with yes men for editors who can't keep his films under two hoursbut hey, that's just me."", 'Following the kidnap and murder of the Israeli team at the 1972 Munich Olympics by the Palestinian terrorist organisation Black September, a team of Mossad secret agents are tasked with killing all those known to have planned the attack. Avner, the lead operative, goes about this grim work with skill and resolve, but slowly finds himself increasingly paranoid and disillusioned with the futility of revenge \x85As with all of Spielberg\'s work, this film is immaculately constructed, with exceptionally fine attention to detail as Rome, Nicosia, Beirut, Athens, London and New York in the early seventies are brilliantly reconstructed. It\'s also particularly well edited, with several sequences stylishly intercutting between scenes to great dramatic effect. It also tackles one of the most difficult political issues there has ever been - the Arab-Israeli conflict - with feeling, intelligence and objectivity, and those who have derided it as both pro and anti-Zionist propaganda are, in a word, wrong. However, the movie\'s mixture of politics and thriller don\'t work very well - the action scenes aren\'t that tense, the gun-battles don\'t have bite because we don\'t know the victims and the deaths of Avner\'s three colleagues are puzzling and inexplicable. Avner\'s descent into guilt and indecision over his actions is laudably acted but weakly written - the morality of being a paid assassin is explored with much more vigour and honesty in films like Leon or Grosse Pointe Blank. The problem with movies ""inspired by real events"" (man, I hate that phrase) is that filmmakers feel a moral responsibility to report like journalists, rather than entertain, which is what movies do best, and so often settle for a watered down middle ground. Compare this film with something like Brian DePalma\'s Mission Impossible";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Read all;"[""I just came across it again after-hours on TV and rewatched the whole thing, although i have seen it twice back in 2013. For the ones who'd want to check it out and dont mind a dark violent social commentary this is a treat. Good cast, good acting (Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton are a highlight), good action and relentless pace. Probably most are familiar with the story of snowpiercer, the train that holds the last of humans and keeps going around the world, while its people are split in sections in the train. That story itself constitutes a great -but not new- metaphor about society. I would keep the metaphor in the background as the backbone of the story and focus on the other exciting elements of the film, which are very rewarding. Good film, 8/10"", 'I read about 20 from the currently 350 reviews here and as far as I\'ve seen, nobody seems to mention 2 key scenes which seemed very important to me, so I\'d like to add my two cents here, a different attempt of interpretation.First key scene: the teacher scene. We witness how completely the children absorbed the doctrine of Wilford. The train manager became a benevolent deity, the system is never questioned, and the train must go on forever. The teacher is a sycophant, very much like Mason. What future do the children have if they are not allowed to think critical?Second key scene: Wilford\'s monologue when he explains how sacrifices have to be made (only by others, i.e. the lower class). If the system can only continue by murder, then mankind survives by inhuman means, although Wilford sees himself not as the leader who created the train and the system, but as just another cogwheel in the machine. Therefore he expects that a younger man might replace him when he is too old, without any change to the system. He cannot imagine any alternative, but others can. In conclusion, what matters is that the train must be stopped somehow to get out of this treadmill. Other reviewers have asked: is it possible to survive in the cold outside, wouldn\'t it be safer to keep going with the train. I think they fell right into the trap here that the movie makers prepared. Because just like the train is going in circles, returning every year to the same places, we are living our lives in circles, safe but in a society that loses its social qualities, as you can see quite often in the treatment of children or elderly people, for example. The revolution, as the film makers describe it, wants to break the circle and start a new life that may be less safe, but challenging and more human. I think people who ask: ""wouldn\'t they freeze to death outside?"" take the allegory too literal again. The frozen world outside represents the unknown, something you take careful glimpses at from the window, but whether it\'s 5 degrees below zero or 25 is hardly the point. The train itself was a better allegory than a ship or an airplane, because these do not strictly stay on the same tracks when they sail or fly around the planet. The polar bear at the end shows that life outside is possible, but one must try and face the unknown instead of continuing the same old evil.I liked \'Snowpiercer\' a lot as it gives much food for thought, but I wouldn\'t call it a flawless masterpiece (voted 8 of 10). The killer shooting through the window, the decadent upper class passengers in swimming pools or the traitor among the lower class passengers are too much of movie clichés. The question of how food is produced was answered much more terrifyingly in \'Soylent Green\' decades before, in \'Snowpiercer\' it was just good enough for a quick shock effect. But don\'t these little niggles stop you from watching this very interesting movie.', 'This film tells the story of a self sustaining train which has been running for 18 years, on board with all the survivors after an apocalyptic event.A few minutes into the film, it already becomes clear that ""Snowpiercer"" is a film that reflects the societal inequality, oppression and cruelty. As the group moves up the train, the carriages becomes more luxurious. The metaphors are very obvious - the film screams to the audience to wake up from the unjust society. However, towards the middle, the plot gets out of hand, and it becomes confusing and even ridiculous. There are too many unexplained moments, such as a kid climbing into the structure jutting out from the front of the train. No follow up was given after this scene is shown. There are also too many ridiculous subplots, such as the party goers suddenly turning violent. The ending is one big confusing mess, and I did not enjoy ""Snowpiercer"".', 'I agree with some reviewers that there are some (unnecessary) plot holes and illogical stuff going on (food supply just one of the main issues, as there are hundreds of people on board, and if you dare to count there are more people like guards, crazies and rich people than on our poor rebels side) but that left aside, Snowpiercer got a refreshing perspective on the postapocalyptic genre/tales and provides some unique ideas and combines them with some solid acting and a pro production.Verdict: not brilliant and no masterpiece but a good and entertaining flick - if you like the genre and want some action on your screen.', ""I don't like movies as art. I like movies that have rules and internal logic, and the premise of this movie is idiotic from both a scientific and common sense angle. It really works though. Like it really works. If you can just suspend disbelief and accept that a train can run forever and sustain some sort of biodome indefinitely then this movie is a masterpiece.I see reviews where people basically complain about how the premise impossible, or that the themes are cliche, and I'm totally with you guys there. Both of those things are true, so if you need realism then you probably won't like this movie. But if you can just accept the premise as it is then this movie is something really special. One of the better movies I've watched in a really long time"", 'I noticed that people seemed to rate this film either quite high or extremely low and reading the reviews, I can see that those who rated high and those who rated low were watching completely different movies.A huge part of the negative criticisms for this movie is the prevalence of plot holes. These are absolutely undeniable. The concept is far-fetched, the execution bizarre, and the upper class characters quite comical. The key to appreciating this film is understanding its purpose. Snowpiercer is clearly a social commentary, but going into it expecting a Hunger Games sort of dystopian social commentary, you are absolutely going to find it ridiculous.Instead, a much better genre match to this film would be Brazil. Its absurdity makes it even more horrifying. The fact that there is no true logic, the contrast between the dingy tail section and the bright colors and extravagance of the front, and the utter hopelessness of the plot make this movie, yes, bizarre to watch and difficult to relate to. However, the alienation of this world from ours brings out the social commentary and the cautionary tale within.Another up-side was the diversity presented in the train and the framing of women WITHOUT the male gaze! All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this film and my only real criticism is that it was way too long.', 'This film reminded me of many lost occasions in cinema where script themes were extremely compelling but poorly executed (think about In Time). The smart idea behind the movie (which comes from the graphic novel La Transperceniege) representing capitalism as a self fuelling train riding across a desert world where no alternative could survive is mostly shadowed by bold action sequences and cliches. This trend reaches the climax in the last 30/40 minutes, as the ending shows us the trite scene of the ""final encounter with the villain"" along with very predictable events. The characters are hollow, rigid and stereotypical as their dialogues are. Differently from his masterpiece Parasite, neither personal nor societal introspection is here elaborated. Unfortunately, Mr Joon-Ho had a visionary novel that he decided to transpose in an average Hollywood style action movie.', 'The only reason I am writing a review right now, is because of how stunned I am at most of the user reviews. While its good that you enjoyed the movie, I am surprised at how most people here are overlooking some of the pretty terrible choices. I will be going through what I thought worked, and what kept me from enjoying the movie. Needless to say";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Broderick\'s and Sheedy\'s winning performances also help. Fortunately, the movie doesn\'t contain too much technical ""jargon"": it is more interested in its clearly stated anti-war message, while at the same time it works as suspenseful entertainment. It may be a little far-fetched sometimes, but when that final moment arrives when the computer realizes that ""the only winning move is not to play"", be prepared to feel a genuine chill.', 'That line spoken by Joshua, the defence computer at NORAD never fails to send shivers down my spine. Even though I\'ve seen WarGames 500 times, its a classic line. Just as resonant as Gloria Swanson asking Mr De Mille for her closeup. Or John Candy\'s heartfelt ""I like me"" speech in Planes, Trains & Automobiles. The difference between Joshua and those people is Joshua is not a real person. Just a computer. But a computer that has a very difficult time distinguishing fantasy from reality. A computer with the same foibles as any flesh and blood person.WarGames was so ahead of its time in so many ways. The way it embraced modems, the use of computer jargon like firewalls. Commonplace things today but practically unheard of back in 1983. Granted some of the technology may have dated (you get to see an actual floppy disk) but the film\'s message hasn\'t faded. And nor has its power. They\'re just as strong as ever.David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) is the classic hi-tech nerd. He\'s a bright boy. He knows the ins and outs of all the computers. And he hacks into systems with all the skill of a safecracker. But he\'s an underachiever at school. Hasn\'t got many friends. And he gets on the wrong side of all the teachers. And his parents.David is far more interested in playing computer games. And when he learns a toy company is planning to release up to date ones in a few months, he wants the inside story. So he hacks into systems until he finds the right one. And he finds one alright. But not the system he thinks.When he taps into Joshua, David gets the chance to play Global ThermoNuclear War. And accidentally sets in motion the countdown to World War III.There is something almost blackly humorous to the way WarGames\' screenplay turns. How through one innocent little action, David begins a chain reaction of increasingly dire circumstances. Although WarGames never gets as black as Dr Strangelove, its very effective in its first half, as the different steps David takes get more and more unnerving. Its all summed up perfectly at the halfway point with another classic line from Joshua, WarGames\' answer to Hal 9000. When asked if Global ThermoNuclear War is a game or not, Joshua innocently replies ""What\'s the difference?""It does tend to get a bit bogged down in the second half with a lot of ethical debates over the futility of nuclear war. But that doesn\'t change the fact that WarGames has got an exceptional cast. Even at the start of his career, and only 21 at the time, Matthew Broderick gives an assured performance. And modulates his character accordingly when David gets in over his head.Ally Sheedy is sometimes a difficult actress to tune in to, but she gives Jennifer, David\'s only real friend a lot of life and spunk. John Wood is suitably flaky as Joshua\'s creator, Dabney Coleman perfectly obnoxious as the head of the computers David\'s messed with, and Barry Corbin\'s general more than just a one-dimensional caricature. Which would have been a lot easier to play.I didn\'t always buy into the technical somersaults that WarGames comes out with. David\'s method of escaping from NORAD is something that just doesn\'t ring true. And you have to suspend disbelief a little too much. All they\'re seeing on those big screens is false. And no one puts it together. But there is something frightening about the film\'s conceit all the same.The line that separates reality from fantasy becomes blurred. And when the subject in question is nuclear war, who wouldn\'t be carried along with that? It all works on the level of a paranoid nightmare that just keeps on going and refuses to stop.The final scenes though are quite philosophical. And again its Joshua who provides that unrelenting, implacable logic. Only this time tempered with common sense. WarGames is filled with many great characters, but its Joshua who is the film\'s heart. That final line at the end is a statement of such striking intelligence, its almost scary:""A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.""', ""Having never watched WARGAMES, I feared that it would be one of those bloated, overrated, downright silly '80s movies, hardly deserving of its classic status. Well, it isn't. In fact, it turns out to be a great film, one that remains endlessly enjoyable despite the leaps and bounds that computer technology has made since this movie came out.Matthew Broderick stars as the likable lead, a teenage computer genius who accidentally hacks into a NORAD computer and all but brings about nuclear war. Yes, this is a film in that '80s 'nuke' cycle, and it's one that brings the palm-sweating seriousness of the situation to life, while at the same time providing plenty of entertainment value along the way. Watching the narrative unfold is a delight, and it's one of those rare beasts that manages to keep the momentum going right up until the closing credits. Great fun indeed."", 'From the opening scene, I was mesmerized by the technology displayed. The thought processes displayed in figuring how to break into systems, by pass door locks, make a pay phone work for free, and how to prevent a world war kick started my problem solving mind. I started working with computers in 1983 because of this movie and I cultivated into an engineering career that I have to this day.\nIt is still completely watchable 37 years later because the story is well written and the characters are well portrayed, particularly by Dabney Coleman, Barry, Matthew Broderick, and John Wood.So thank you, ""Wargames"". If I didn\'t watch you back in 1983 as 19 year old who had no idea what he wanted to do, I would probably be in a career I would not be enjoying as much as the one I have now.', 'Yes I\'m a geezer and personally I like this movie. Sure it has ancient computer hardware and the software is so out of date most of us don\'t remember what it was like. In 1983 the internet wasn\'t even close to being considered for what it is used for today. Few homes then had a personal computer they were to expensive for the ""casual"" user. Would love to see it updated. With the currently rash of remakes in Hollywood and all the dark times in current events it would be interesting to see a modern twist on this movies genre. We know there are still hackers out there and certainly film makers are more savvy to the computer age that a remake of this particular script could certainly turn out to be a better movie than the original.', ""Ally Sheedy and Matthew Broderick, a couple of kids, become involved in something that is far beyond them. Broderick, who knows computers (in1983), inadvertently gets into a game (or so he thinks) of Thermonuclear War. It turns out that he has actually hacked into a military program that is feeding the U.S. information about that very subject. It's not a game as he thought it was but he also realizes what is happening. Now the problem is that he needs to convince someone what is going on, and they, then, have to put a stop to it. Think what little effect the computer world had in those days and realize how dangerous they have become. Good chemistry by two future stars."", ""This movie was really scary to me when I first saw it. I was terrified by the idea that a nuclear war would ever occur, and if it would because of some mistake, that would be even more alarming. And this film sure helps imagination along.As such, it is successful. But there are many questions, and the mere chance that some high school kid hacks into a computer designed for games and control of the US nukes (how about that?) is...well, let's say slim.But, nonetheless, it scared the willies out of me as a kid, and now it is interesting to watch. I would like to have a remote controlled pterodactyl too."", 'John Badham directed this computer-gone-mad picture that stars Mathew Broderick as David, a rebellious teenager and computer whiz who likes to hack into his high school computer system to change his grades to an ""A"", or insult his science teacher. Things take a serious turn when he accidentally hacks into the Pentagon\'s computer that controls the missiles aimed at Russia. David and the computer think it is a game, but it turns out to be frighteningly real, as David finds himself targeted by the military, forcing him and his girlfriend Jennifer(played by Ally Sheedy) to go on the run... Entertaining film may have a most unlikely premise(one would hope!) but is well cast and directed. Dabney Coleman is quite good as David\'s chief ""nemesis"".', 'In Seattle, the teenager David (Matthew Broderick) is a lazy but bright student that prefers to hack and change his grades in the high-school computer than study. One day, David\'s best friend Jennifer (Ally Sheedy) is with him and he decides to hack the toy company Protovision seeking new games and he accidentally connects the War Operation Plan Response system in a computer located at the North American Aerospace (NORAD) at Birmingham using the password Joshua that was the name of the son of its creator, the deceased scientist Stephen Falken (John Wood). David challenges the computer to play a Global Thermonuclear War game between USA and the Soviet Union. Sooner he realizes that the computer is playing for real and the United States of America is changing its condition to DEFCON 1 in a game with no winners. ""Wargames"" is one of my favorite films of the 80\'s and despite the Cold War, it is nostalgic to watch again a period with little violence in the world and how life was easier, flying in a plane is just as one good example that we can see in this film. Hollywood still was able to make good movies based on great original stories. Matthew Broderick was an amazing promising actor with ""Ladyhawke"" and ""Ferris Bueller\'s Day Off"" and the hacker David is ahead of time. Ally Sheedy shows her charm, lovely smile and a great chemistry with Broderick. ""Wargame"" has a witty and funny story with a magnificent message in times of Cold War that is highlighted in the very end: ""The Only Winning Move (in a nuclear war) Is not to Play"". Fortunately most of the Powers that Be of the world has finally understood this message with the end of the Cold War. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Jogos de Guerra"" (""War Games"")', ""War games is one of the few '80s movies that will stand the test of time. A good script, good casting, limited but effective special effects (credit to the director: besides the dial-up modem, the whole computer thing is not outdated, and a director's vision that avoids stereotypes and tropes, all add up to a good thriller yhat will still entertain and keep a viewer on the edge of a seat up until the final scene."", ""Seeing this again, 30 years later, I'm of two minds. There's still a lot to enjoy in this slightly Disney version of an end-of-the-world thriller. There's a lot of clever twists in the plot, some lovely performances, some real tension. But it also all feels a bit light and softened to make it more audience friendly. That was probably the right decision commercially, but maybe not artistically. If original director Martin Brest had been allowed to finish the film, with the somewhat darker original script I read back then, I wonder if this could have been a bit of a minor classic, in the family of great nuclear war films like Dr. Strangelove and Fail Safe, instead of an entertaining, intelligent thrill ride. There are also, on reflection some big logic holes you could fly missiles through. But at the end of the day, I still enjoyed re-seeing it, smiling a good deal of the time."", ""As the film opens we see two men turning for duty at a US missile silo";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
